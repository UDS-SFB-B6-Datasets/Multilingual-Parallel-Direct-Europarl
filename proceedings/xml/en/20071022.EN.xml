      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, last Thursday and Friday we had a very successful summit meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the European Union with the President of the Commission, the President of the European Parliament and our three Intergovernmental Conference representatives.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Whilst I have no wish to anticipate the content of tomorrow’s debate with the President-in-Office of the European Council, José Socrates, I would like to stress that, in the eyes of the European Parliament, the summit was a truly resounding success because the entry into force of the Treaty, which is scheduled for the start of 2009, will give our Parliament equal rights in almost all areas of legislation. We in the European Parliament have not wavered from the course we adopted for the Convention and followed in spite of the setbacks in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, and if this Treaty now materialises we shall have played a key part in its creation. We hope that the ratification process will be successfully concluded in all 27 countries of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The signing of the Treaty will take place in Lisbon on 13 December, and on the previous day – the twelfth of December, as agreed with the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission – we shall proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at a formal sitting here in Strasbourg. That will be a significant event.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the work of our three representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference – Elmar Brok, Enrique Barón Crespo and Andrew Duff.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I am pleased to see that Enrique Barón Crespo is with us, but I cannot see the other representatives. In that case we shall defer the approval of the Minutes.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I am well aware that Mr Cohn-Bendit’s thirst for knowledge knows no bounds. Let me say to you that there was not one second in the entire process when this was in any doubt. Nor was the matter raised at all during the open session at the summit meeting. But this rumour was being spread in other circles. Wherever I could, I acted immediately to quash it. There can never be a situation where the European Council or any other body could withdraw the voting rights of the President of the European Parliament. This is not about me personally but about the office of the President of Parliament. I would vigorously oppose any such move, and the House is united on that stance.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday, 17 October, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments to this draft have been tabled:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Wednesday:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Green Group has moved that the tabling of motions for resolutions be permitted at the end of the debate on the Council and Commission statements concerning the EU-Russia summit.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we spoke about this at the Conference of Presidents and said that, in view of the EU summit with Russia, Mr Putin’s trip to Iran and the very real nature of the disputes that are taking place there, it would surely be absurd for this Parliament to debate these matters and not adopt a resolution in which the position of Parliament is set out. Who are we, in point of fact? We always want to have powers of codecision, yet now, when we have the opportunity to take a decision, we choose not to.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are in favour of a resolution prior to the EU-Russia summit and, if need be, another resolution after the summit. It is the duty of Parliament to scrutinise the Commission and formulate political guidelines and not simply to behave like a debating society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it has indeed been the practice of this House in the past, on matters of major importance such as the EU-Russia Summit, to have a debate followed by a resolution. There are many things that need to be said and many messages that this Parliament needs to send to those who will represent the Union at that summit. We should indeed send a firm message to the Russians and a firm message to the people who will represent us at the summit, with the beliefs of this House behind it. My Group would therefore support that move.</p>

      <p sl="en">Those who are putting forward this motion for a resolution seem to believe that the debates of this House only matter if we adopt a resolution at the end of the debate. They are actually devaluing the debate itself, because all of them are outside negotiating the text of a resolution instead of being inside the House debating it. The points they and others wish to make ahead of this summit can be made in this House by a very vigorous debate, by people making articulate and intelligent points, instead of going out and working all night in a drafting committee to add to the huge book that we write at the end of each part-session, with pages and pages of resolutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is about time we changed our priorities and revalued the debates on the floor of this House. I plead for Members to have vigorous debates in this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am not noted for intervening to any great extent on points of order, but we hold this debate every Monday at five in the afternoon. I have started to wonder why we have another debate on matters of political importance on Thursday afternoons. Maybe this very question could be discussed again by the parliamentary powers that be, because we have this same discussion every time about whether some item, such as a summit that some people are holding somewhere or other, should or should not be added to the agenda. I would very much welcome a question of this nature being placed on one of the agendas of the House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I will speak on behalf of my Group. As you will realise, a few days ago there was the most monumental suicide bomb attack against the party with the returning Ms Benazir Bhutto, with over a hundred civilians killed. There has been the recent deportation by the Government of Pakistan of another returning civilian politician, Nawaz Sharif. All sorts of things have been happening in that very key strategic South Asian country which need to be urgently debated by this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not aware of any recent changes in the situation in Uzbekistan, other than the fact that the Council is deliberating on whether or not to remove the travel bans on Uzbek leaders. That pales into insignificance compared to what is going on in Pakistan, so I would urge this House to support the need to debate the Pakistani situation on Thursday.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is always so difficult to decide between the pros and cons. We were in favour of this motion, and we could subscribe to it if we had an undertaking from the EPP-ED Group and other groups that Uzbekistan really would be put on the agenda and discussed at the next opportunity. In other words, changing the agenda should not mean losing sight of Uzbekistan and the developments that are taking place there. Given such an undertaking, we could support the motion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there can be no doubt that Pakistan is a very important issue. It is too important, however, to deal with it as an item in Thursday afternoon’s debate on breaches of human rights. Discussing Pakistan is clearly not just a matter of examining human-rights violations but a real opportunity to debate aspects of EU foreign policy in that entire region.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we would do better to put Pakistan on our next agenda as a proper debate with the Council and the Commission, because that, in my view, is what we need most. The subject of Uzbekistan is of more immediate concern, because the Council intends to lift certain sanctions today. In the present situation, I believe we should adopt the position that what is happening in Uzbekistan is a human-rights issue which dictates that sanctions should not be lifted. That can be quickly decided on Thursday afternoon. Pakistan is a very difficult and crucial foreign-policy issue and should be placed on our next agenda.</p>

      <p sl="bg">the documentary screened on BBC 4, describing the conditions in and attitudes to the inmates of the social care home for physically and mentally disabled children in the village of Mogilino, has evoked tempestuous response in the Bulgarian and international community. This makes me tell what steps have been undertaken.</p>
      <p sl="bg">First of all, we sent inquiries to the Minister of Labour and Social Policy and to the Chairperson of the State Agency for Child Protection. We demanded that the home be closed down and the de-institutionalisation process be accelerated. The Ministry sent an answer to our inquiry.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, we appealed to international non-governmental organisations providing social services to disabled people. Among them is Betel, the largest charity organisation in Europe with 150-year-long experience in providing care to mentally disabled people. Its experts responded to my request to visit the home in Mogilino together and seek specific solutions to the problems.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The government is primarily responsible for the provision of the necessary material and technical conditions at these homes amd for the support of the children. What we need, however, is a changed concept of social services to children with severe mental disabilities and changed attitude to them on part of society and institutions. The isolation of these children in hardly accessible villages and small towns is a practice long abandoned in Europe. Problems will not be resolved by hiding the truth but by the concerted efforts of all of us.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this Parliament is internationally recognised as an institution of freedom and human rights which respects international law and the United Nations system.</p>
      <p sl="es">In view of this, many of us would like to hear Parliament’s own assessment, and that of its President, of the outcry produced by the public disclosure of conversations between Presidents Bush and Aznar in 2003 at Crawford Ranch shortly before the invasion of Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="es">Aspects of that conversation are extremely serious because they demonstrate a total lack of respect for the United Nations, disdain for trans-Atlantic relations and disregard for international law.</p>
      <p sl="es">We all had suspicions that something had occurred along these lines but never before has the evidence been so clear; so clear that it requires Parliament to take a stance if only to state that such a shameful thing must never occur again.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The fact that reports by European politicians on global warming, energy saving and similar issues are received with indifference in most European countries is cause for concern. Similarly, regions, provinces and other administrative units do not give these problems the consideration they are due. Cases where energy is wasted and the consequences of global warming are neglected can easily be seen everywhere. For example, almost every day on my way from Brussels to Luxembourg I see street lights stretching over tens of kilometres, but no-one, neither Wallonia nor Belgium or the provinces, admits responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="lt">On the other hand, very often, even within the European Parliament, our words do not match our deeds. It is beyond my comprehension why, at every sitting at Strasbourg, each Member is handed around 200-300 pages of stenographs and protocols. In my opinion, we should have this material only on the Internet and put a stop to printing it out.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on 10 October two activists from the Polish Association in Belarus, Angelika Borys and Igor Bancer, were arrested again in Grodno. They were charged under the pretext of hooliganism and Bancer was sentenced to ten days’ imprisonment, whilst Borys was fined the equivalent of about fifteen times the average monthly salary in Belarus. It is well known, however, that the real reason for their arrest was the planned demonstration by the opposition against the authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko. The Belarus authorities have again demonstrated that organisational independence and freedom will not be tolerated in that country. Fear, arrests under any pretext, and maligning western countries are the methods that Lukashenko has used for a long time to maintain his tyrannous rule.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we cannot allow such widespread breaches of the human rights of personal dignity and freedom to take place right next to the European Union. Europe cannot be democratic if Belarus is not a free country. Let us increase our spending to help Belarus society to escape from the tyranny of dictatorship. Let us demand that the rights of ethnic minorities be respected, that arrests without just cause be stopped and that political prisoners be freed. This is the only way to change the one tyranny and dictatorship in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you Mr President. I would like to speak about the Turkish Parliament’s decision to authorise the Turkish military to go into the only relatively calm region in Iraq. It now looks as though we will be able to include these events in our discussion on the general report on Wednesday. I hope that everyone will have the opportunity to be involved in the process and to table amendments, as this is a big threat to peace in the region. It highlights the problem of the military exerting pressure and pushing through decisions. We must now ensure that the government resists, that there are no troops and that no one is provoked into going into Iraq with military forces. If there is anything they have too much of, it is the military. If there is anything they have too little of, it is normal discussion between people and that is what we must support. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year before the start of the Beijing Olympic Games, worrying messages are being daily given out to the public at large. This time it is not a case of human rights or environmental pollution, but the decision by the Organising Committee and the authorities of the People’s Republic of China to ban any type or form of religious worship by participants in the Olympic Games. In contravention of the agreements adhered to since the beginning of the Olympic Games and signed by the Chinese authorities and the International Olympic Committee, and religious symbols such as the Bible, the New and the Old Testaments, places of prayer and even the crucifix on a chain round the neck of a male or female athlete will be banned.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, colleagues, on 3 October the Michelin group announced that it is to cease tyre production at its Toul plant. More than 800 jobs are likely go by 2009, although neither the company’s industrial performance nor its financial results indicate any crisis behind these redundancies. Shareholders are selling off equity at a profit, on the back of the restructuring announcement, while ordinary men and women come to terms with the fact that they alone will bear the brunt of the situation. I should like to put on record before the House how much I respect the trade union representatives and workers who, despite the deeply gloomy prospect they face, have shown a tremendous sense of responsibility from the outset. The issue now is not about finding a humane way of closing a factory; it is about finding ways of retaining jobs in areas such as this, which can be extremely hard hit. The workforce in Toul expects the EU to create systems of protection and organisation that will be capable of securing workers’ social rights, helping people to get back into employment, and putting compensation funds to good use in relaunching industrial projects. What they need is the flexisecurity that we, as European Socialists, have been urging; but it is also essential to encourage adaptation to industrial competitiveness and explore ways of promoting an integrated industrial policy for the benefit of all the areas in Europe currently affected by restructuring.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the deteriorating situation on the border between Iraq and Turkey. On Sunday morning, 12 Turkish soldiers and 32 Kurds were killed in a Kurdish ambush. As we already know, the Turkish Parliament has approved the invasion of Kurdish-populated areas in northern Iraq.

Hence, there is a strong probability of an escalation into a serious military conflict in northern Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since Turkey is officially an EU candidate country, is it not time for us to act to try to stop a military conflict between Kurdish fighters and the invading Turkish troops? Otherwise the situation might really destabilise in this fragile region and bring about frightening and unforeseeable consequences.</p>

It was only after an hour of discussions that it was finally decided to treat the situation as exceptional and the passenger and the dog were taken on board. This situation undoubtedly had a negative impact on her health.</p>

      <p sl="bg">My country Bulgaria is on the eve of the first local elections to be held after the accession to the European Union. Therefore they are different and charged with lots of expectations derived from the new European realities. Capable and active people should be elected to local authorities to work skilfully with EU funds. Bulgaria stands a good chance to absorb almost seven billion Euro over the period 2007 – 2013 as a full EU member. However, it is much more important for these resources to reach the people who need them most rather than to sink into the coffers of companies or political parties. Since Europe is Europe of the regions and decentralisation is an irreversible process, the role of the people involved in local government is growing.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Bulgaria has repeatedly and justifiably been criticized for its insufficient administrative capacity and for the shortcomings in the work of institutions. Having received the trust and confidence of our European partners and having become part and parcel of the big European family, we should make the next important step, too, i.e. to elect mayors and municipal councillors capable of working not only at the regional and national level but at the European level, as well. As a representative of Bulgaria in the European Parliament, I find it very important for highly qualified and competent people to be elected to local authorities. Entering the common European home, we have to make our personal efforts to gain our well deserved place rather than receive it as a gift.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, tomorrow Hungary celebrates the anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and fight for freedom. The past few years, and the debates that have taken place on the nature of Hitlerism and Stalinism and the damage they caused, including debates in this House, have demonstrated that Europe’s more fortunate western half experienced history very differently from the ten newly acceded central European Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Likewise, 9 May has a different meaning for us. For us it was not just the date of liberation, but also the start of occupation. Three central European events, acts of opposition to the Soviet Union and Soviet-style Communist dictatorships – the Hungarian Revolution of ’56, the Prague Spring of ’68, and the Polish Solidarity (Solidarność) movement – have nevertheless become part of our common European history. The uniqueness of 1956 lies in the fact that no other uprising involved a people taking up arms against the world’s largest army, the Soviet army, and no other case involved a country declaring its neutrality.</p>
      <p sl="hu">All the goals for which the heroes of 1956 were fighting – democracy, the rule of law, and liberty – were realised with the regime change. If we Hungarians can be proud of anything in the 20th century, we should be proud of the 1956 Revolution and the role we played in Germany’s reunification. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The use of cyanides is one of the current gold and silver mining methods. I would like to emphasize that the effects of such a mining process may lead to the irreversible destruction of ecosystems and seriously harm the human body, since cyanide is one of the substances that pass unchanged into underground waters, the main existent source of drinkable water. In the context of global warming, cyanide has the role of changing the temperature and precipitations pattern, generating floods and landslides. The accident that happened in Romania, in Baia Mare, in the year 2000, when, following the crack of a tailing pond, approximately 100,000 m3 of water contaminated with cyanide and heavy metals was spilled, caused the biggest catastrophe in Eastern Europe since Chernobyl. This triggered a mining law reform in Romania by introducing an amendment to the Parliament, which prohibited the use of cyanide in mining.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Mr. President, I express my wish to see Romania's example followed by the other European Union countries, as well, so that the prohibition of cyanide shall become an European rule eventually.</p>

Bearing in mind that the Court of Auditors is due to report back next month, I want to draw your attention to the Interinstitutional Agreement signed between the three Institutions in 2006. Under Article 44 of that agreement, all Member States are obliged to give certification for financial transactions involving EU monies. I am advised that under the current programme the Commission will not receive relevant information from the Member States until 15 February 2008. Only at that point can the common standards in accountancy and internal controls be identified. This means that it is unlikely the Court of Auditors will receive the required information for a further two years. That is not acceptable. Not only does it contravene the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement, but the ongoing failure to achieve a satisfactory audit report seriously undermines the credibility of this House. I urge you, Mr President, to take every opportunity to insist that Member States attach far greater urgency to this matter in the future.</p>

However, with the Kosovan authorities threatening to declare independence unilaterally, Serbia arguing for a system of broad autonomy and Russia vetoing the UN special envoy’s proposal for supervised independence, the situation is critical. My concern is to highlight the key role that the European Union will have to play in resolving the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is our collective wish that the Union should have a High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. But what credibility can that appointment carry if we are incapable of playing our part in finding a specific solution to the Kosovo situation, which is still officially classed under foreign affairs although it is in fact a matter of internal concern to the Union? The EU therefore needs to demonstrate a sense of direction and a clear vision that reflects compromise between the Serbian and Kosovan demands, while taking care not to open the Pandora’s Box of partition; and it needs to speak out on the future of Kosovo and make its voice heard in the concert of nations.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President. The European Parliament delegation to Chile met not only with Chilean MPs, but also with environmental organisations earlier this month in Santiago. In their view, the behaviour of European Union companies locating in Chile is very far removed from the environmental principles they espouse in Europe. The legal and ethical positions on this are clear, but unfortunately the two are diametrically opposed. What these companies are doing may be legally above-board, but ethically it is damaging. A lack of environmental legislation often entices European capital abroad. Relocation of this kind is detrimental to our interests in many ways. We must therefore push for environmental rigour not only within the European Union, but also outside it. The European Union must be the initiator, because a failure to take responsibility towards the next generation on the global scale is now inflicting material and non-material damage on Europe’s citizens.</p>

Since 1963, a so-called Green Line has divided the city and its people into a Greek Cypriot and a Turkish Cypriot sector. This line is closely guarded by Turkish troops on one side and Republic of Cyprus troops on the other.

It is our duty to try and reduce smoking and especially to prevent young people from starting. If we are to succeed, strong legislation is needed. Smoking in public places must be banned. Industrial additives in tobacco have to be monitored, researched and restricted. We need monitoring and rigour at sales points.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, within the psychological framework, feelings such as responsible love for another person, family or one’s country – which is given the name of patriotism – are evidence, together with other higher emotions, of a high level of personal development. In contrast with primitive emotions that we share with animals, higher emotions even have a separate area in the brain. Patriotism expresses itself as love for and a desire to nurture national traditions, culture and language, attitudes of respect and devotion to one’s own country. These are completely opposed to nationalism and chauvinism, which are characterised by hatred of other people. Patriotism does not permit offence to nations or countries. It is characterised primarily by openness to other countries and respect for their right to sovereignty and independence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to remind you of the nature of patriotism, particularly after the speeches made by certain left-wing MEPs who have insulted national governments and patriotic attitudes, perhaps because they do not understand the difference between love for one’s country and the hatred that characterises such attitudes as chauvinism. In a situation of European integration it is particularly important to differentiate between these completely different concepts that are confused by many people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, addressing concerns about energy supply is one of the major and most important issues facing the European Union, linked as it is with concerns about climate change. Security of supply and rising cost, with prices up 100% in the last five years, are major worries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well, for Ireland the challenges are particularly great. We face growing demand for energy and yet a high dependency on imported fossil fuels. We are 90% dependent. We need to invest heavily in our infrastructure, work towards liberalising the market and reduce our carbon emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament is looking at an action plan on implementing energy policy for Europe. Within Ireland we are establishing an all-Ireland energy market with the merging of electricity markets north and south. That is positive, but it is not enough. The scale of the market is too small. To achieve a harmonised energy market, inter-connection with the rest of the European Union is vital for Ireland – but that will cost money, and I would urge the Irish Government to look at the use of cohesion funding to make that investment, because it is necessary for the continuation of Irish economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, first let me thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs, Mrs Belohorská and Mrs Klaß, for their exceptionally thorough work. Thanks are also due to the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee, to Mr Ebner and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and to Mrs Corbey and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for the reports and view they expressed at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="el">Over the last thirty years the EU’s policies and laws on the protection of public health and the environment have enabled us to make significant progress, considerably reducing the risks of pesticides. Current legislation, however, focuses on the one hand on approving and placing products on the market, and on the other hand on monitoring product residues in food and animal feed. Between these two points of focus no law covers the period when pesticides are used. This, however, is the crucial stage; during it human health and the environment are at risk.</p>
      <p sl="el">The monitoring programmes implemented in Member States have exposed traces of pesticides not only in food and animal feed but also in the environment itself, in concentrations exceeding the limits values set by European legislation. Additionally, it has become clear that pesticides are an issue of serious concern to European citizens. We ought therefore try harder to increase the protection of European citizens and our environment. The thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides and the framework directive accompanying it are covered under the general heading of tackling the human health and environmental due to pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="el">The main elements of the Commission’s proposal for a framework directive are as follows.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, each Member State will draw up national action plans establishing targets, measures and timetables to reduce risks and dependence on pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, professional pesticide users, who are mainly farmers, distributors and advisers, will need to have access to appropriate training. This will teach them enough about the risks of pesticides and about using alternative means. Public awareness-raising about the risks of using pesticides will also need to be increased.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, professional equipment for pesticide spraying will have to undergo regular checks and be correctly maintained.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fourthly, aerial spraying will be prohibited, but Member States will retain the option to make exceptions in limited cases where aerial spraying is the only feasible solution.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fifthly, special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population, as well as water systems and geographical areas, such as those of the Natura 2000 network. Such measures may include, among others, creating buffer zones, or prohibiting or restricting the use of pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="el">Sixthly and finally, but just as importantly, we must support agricultural techniques which have recourse to low pesticide doses. This is to enable the implementation of integrated pest control, which ought to become compulsory from 2014.</p>
      <p sl="el">Other measures envisaged by the thematic strategy have been incorporated or will be incorporated shortly in other legislative acts. These include a proposal to regulate the placing of plant protection products on the market. The regulation will bring about an ever greater restriction of harmful active substances circulating in the market, particularly through comparative assessment and adherence to the principle of substitution. This is my colleague Mr Kyprianou’s proposal, which we are also discussing this evening on the basis of the report drafted by Mrs Breyer.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is also a proposal to regulate the collection of statistical data on plant protection products. This proposal is of crucial importance; it establishes indicators to measure progress on risk reduction. The proposal is now being discussed by the relevant Parliamentary Committee.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is also a proposed new directive laying down basic specifications for spraying equipment to be placed on the market. The proposal will add to the existing provisions on the maintenance and regular inspection of spraying equipment.</p>
      <p sl="el">In conclusion, Mr President, let me stress how important an aspect of the proposed directive on the sustainable use of pesticides integrated pest management is. This is a fundamental measure of the Commission’s proposal; it has been debated by the other parliamentary sub-committees.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nobody doubts that we must reduce dependency on pesticides and turn to more environmentally friendly alternative means of protecting plants and controlling pests. Integrated management and pest control are the most effective way to achieve this goal. It is thus particularly important that this element should be maintained in our proposal and should become compulsory in all Member States from 2014.</p>

    <intervention id="1-077" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Markos Kyprianou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, we shall be debating a really difficult but important issue today.</p>
      <p sl="el">let me first of all thank all those who have worked to make this debate possible today, and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer.</p>
      <p sl="el">The subject has always been difficult. A balance needs to be struck. Protection of health and the environment need to be increased, while procedures are simplified and administrative costs are reduced to allow for greater competitiveness and innovation. I am convinced that the Commission’s proposal will help achieve these two goals, for it supplements the internal market. It does this by setting up a system of flexible mutual recognition of zones, and allowing Member States to take measures and to adopt restrictions, in cases of special health or environmental hazards, whether in throughout a Member State or in parts of it.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that plant protection products play an important role in agriculture, crop growing, silviculture and market gardening. I wish we did not need them, because they certainly affect human and animal health, and the environment. We must therefore ensure that the relevant rules are effective and balanced.</p>
      <p sl="el">The legislation in force dates from 1991. On the basis of a 2001 report by the Commission on the legislation’s function and where it can be improved, both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive. I daresay nobody doubts the need for the existing legislation to be updated.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me to thank the interested bodies in all sectors and mention the vital contribution they have made in the framework of this proposal’s preliminary draft . The Commission has also carried out a comprehensive impact assessment.</p>
      <p sl="el">The first priority is indisputably to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health, as well as for the environment. This will be achieved through a number of provisions: establishing clear, strict criteria for the approval of active substances; giving a central role to the European Food Safety Authority in the assessment of active substances; and obliging farmers to maintain files on the use of plant protection products, to be made available on request to their neighbours and the water industry. The Member States’ authorities will also have to intensify checks on the commercial exploitation and use of plant protection products, and the Commission will examine and verify how effectively Member States are carrying out these checks. Further experiments on animals will be banned outright. So as to promote sustainable agriculture, the safest alternative solutions will replace the most hazardous products. The proposal will thus create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">The proposal does the same as the Lisbon Strategy because it will also reduce administrative costs. The procedure will be shorter and more efficient, while, more importantly I believe, preserving levels of safety and protecting the health of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Member States will no longer be working in isolation because mutually recognising approvals will now be the rule, rather the exception. This will avoid dividing the internal market over plant protection products and stop splitting the market over agricultural products.</p>
      <p sl="el">The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="el">The proposed regulation is one of the keys to the Commission’s overall strategy in the pesticides sector. It complements the proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, which has already been analysed by my colleague, Mr Dimas.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, let me to mention the large number of amendments which have been tabled. This is hardly surprising for such a complex subject and perhaps we have not yet reached complete agreement in our views. I am optimistic that we will shortly be able to do so the next stages of the procedure. Meanwhile, the Commission can accept certain amendments while rejecting others. The complete list, with the Commission’s view on each amendment and the relevant explanation, is available to Parliament and MEPs. It is not for me to analyse every amendment separately here because there is certainly not enough time. I ask for this list to be included in the Minutes of the sitting.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to a constructive and interesting debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioners Dimas and Kyprianos, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission’s proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides, and my remarks here today will be confined to that part of the overall package.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a vast field, in which a great deal of adjustment is still needed throughout Europe for the sake of consumers and users and particularly for the sake of the environment. Differing rules in the European Union not only create divergent safety standards but are also confusing and distort competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">The possibility of pests destroying a whole year’s harvests is, thankfully, a thing of the past in Europe. Today, however, we face new major challenges, to which we must respond with a sound policy on plant protection. The global population is growing, and food is becoming scarcer worldwide. Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place: new pests are appearing, and natural disasters decimate harvests. It is still essential today, therefore, to safeguard harvests, and the use of plant protection agents helps to do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">With plant protection, as with many other things in life, it is the dose that makes the poison. Whilst a sleeping tablet is a boon, many sleeping tablets can be fatal. Care must be taken to ensure that plant protection products are used properly and professionally, because improper use is dangerous. That is true not only on farmland but also in public spaces such as parks, playgrounds, sports fields, pathways and railway tracks. Information, education and knowledge of the implications of pesticide use, of its benefits but also of its risks, are at the heart of this directive. Sellers and users of plant protection agents must be trained and informed.</p>
      <p sl="de">By means of national action plans, the Member States must ensure that plant protection products are used sustainably. In so doing, they must strive for consistency with other Community provisions. Well-tested and safe application machinery will ensure targeted plant protection, the aim being to minimise any risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">An arbitrary percentage reduction across the entire range of plant protection agents runs counter to the aims of good agricultural practice and integrated pest management. We need both these factors, Commissioner Dimas, and we shall continue to need good farming practice and integrated pest management, because we need dynamism. The stringent regulation on authorisation, moreover, has been reduced to absurdity. Products with harmful effects must not be authorised at all; it is not enough to cut their use by half. If, however, plant protection agents have come through a stringent approval process, reducing their use by a certain percentage across the board would be illogical. Moreover, no one has yet been able to explain to me precisely how such a reduction is supposed to be managed and quantified.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same applies to protection of the aquatic environment. The arbitrary establishment of standard buffer strips next to water bodies serves no purpose. A differentiated approach remains necessary here. Buffer strips must be right for the geographical situation, the soil properties and the plants that require protection. This kind of approach has already been adopted in the instructions for use that come with the various plant protection products.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned crop spraying from the air, Commissioner. For the steeply sloping vineyards along the banks beside the Moselle in my home area or indeed for the rice plantations in southern Europe, there is no alternative. In those places crop spraying from the air is indispensable. The use of crop spraying helicopters, however, must be regulated. Particular care is needed in sensitive areas, such as parks and public or school playgrounds. The use of pesticides there must be kept to an absolute minimum, and non-chemical alternatives should take precedence. In my opinion, that could even mean sending out an entire school class to weed the school grounds.</p>
      <p sl="de">Banning plant protection altogether in areas that are home to particular species of flora and fauna would be inconsistent with the aims of habitat conservation. Pesticides are actually essential if these habitats are to be preserved. Plant protection products are expensive, and no farmer will apply more than is absolutely necessary. Additional taxes distort competition in the world market. They would result in the purchase of cheaper products from outside the EU, which would ill serve the cause of sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want the same protection and the same standard throughout the EU. In many countries the proposed measures have typified good practice for some time. For this reason, harmonisation of the rules governing the use of plant protection agents is imperative, which is why the Commission’s approach is the right one. It is up to all of us now – and we can take this as an invitation – to initiate a directive that keeps red tape to a minimum while matching our aspirations. I ask for your support.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I am not quite sure what is going on. I took part in the discussions on these various reports in the Committee on the Environment but it seemed to me that what Mrs Klaß has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, may I say to Mrs Isler Béguin that there was no unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, that we definitely took the opposite view and that most of my group opposed the position to which she refers. I have certainly stressed that I support the Commission’s proposal.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, being a non-legislative political document that accompanies the directive, responds to the fact that the risks of pesticide use are not decreasing. Today’s residue levels in food products exceed acceptable values: 44% of fruit is contaminated with pesticides, 5.5% of which contains the maximum residue level. Excessive residues were even found in the fruit being sold in the European Parliament premises. The aim of my report is to minimise the dangers and risks to health and environment that arise from the use of pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Firstly, I would like to stress that the use of pesticides is linked to the development of malignant tumours or immunological and other neurotoxic defects. That is why I found it surprising (unfortunately it was a bad surprise) that in its text the Commission mentions only in passing the health risks posed by the use of pesticides, in particular by their cumulative effect. Pregnant women, children and foetuses are the group most at risk. Although I am in favour of protecting plants, I think that first and foremost we have to protect people’s health. There is clearly a connection with climate change. Global warming will bring more pests: we cannot continue endlessly to increase the amounts of pesticides used.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The National Action Plans containing the Member States’ individual targets in terms of risk reduction are the most important part of the whole process. I consider the proposal in which the Commission rejects the quantitative use reduction targets to be insufficient. The phrase ‘to reduce hazards, risks and dependence on pesticides’ is imprecisely defined and will not prompt the Member States to lower the amount of pesticides used.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Thematic Strategy is a general text and does not offer a detailed solution for calculating the amounts. However, my colleagues and I propose the following for the directive: a 50% reduction in the most dangerous substances that are, if used in certain large quantities, carcinogens and mutagens; the use of biological pesticides and pesticides that present little danger does not have to be reduced at present; the so-called frequency of application index will be used for other pesticides. The individual characteristics of, and conditions in, each Member State will be taken into account. It must be emphasised that quantitative indicators in the National Action Plans do not impose equal reduction of pesticide use on all countries. They will take into consideration the specific geographical conditions and arable farming systems of the given country.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is true that an automatic reduction in quantity does not necessarily lead to risk reduction; however, it does so in many cases. The Thematic Strategy and the directive must deal with both crop protection measures and biocides. Protection of the aquatic environment from contamination by pesticides must be strengthened through the establishment of buffer zones along watercourses. Although I support the ban on aerial spraying, I accept that it will be possible to grant an exception under certain circumstances, in the absence of a more viable alternative. When aerial sprayings take place, the general public will be informed, by suitable means, about the time of spraying, the place and the substance used. The Strategy is not directed against farmers. I believe that all these measures can be taken without radical cuts in farmers’ budgets. This was proved by the Danish experience. All of us have to realise how important it is for farmers to be competitive, and we have to make sure that their products will not be replaced by products of farmers from developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">To conclude, allow me to express my opinion on the amendments. I cannot agree with Amendment 4, which seeks to change the name of the entire Thematic Strategy. Although I want pesticides to be used with care, I think that we should leave the official name of the entire document as it is: after all it is an official name in the Official Journal and I think that it is suitable. I also want to mention Amendments 3 and 5, which deal with residential zones. Amendment 3 proposes to add the term ‘urban’: to me this means ‘suburban zone’ and thus excludes those who live in rural areas. The term ‘residential zones’ is both vague and imprecise. I also propose to amend paragraph 8 linguistically because the term ‘practitioner’ is a bad translation; in French it is even ‘médecin’ . I am going to finish, Mr President, and to conclude I would like to thank sincerely all those who worked on this report.</p>

    <intervention id="1-082" speaker_id="1059" name="Hiltrud BREYER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="22-08-1957" birth_place="Saarbrücken" p_group="Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the privilege of introducing a report that will offer Parliament the opportunity tomorrow to vote for a breakthrough towards greater health, and environmental and consumer protection. According to the Eurobarometer, the use of pesticides is the foremost concern among European consumers, and the Committee has taken that into account.</p>
      <p sl="de">More than 220 000 tonnes of pesticide are applied in Europe every year. This represents 25% of global pesticide use on only 4% of the world’s farmland. In our view, the eradication of high-risk pesticides should be the core of this regulation. These are pesticides which have carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductively toxic properties as well as those with neurotoxic, immunotoxic or hormonal effects.</p>
      <p sl="de">This regulation would be a huge contribution to making pesticides safer, but we must also incorporate rules for less dangerous pesticides. The active substances that are most frequently discovered in concentrations exceeding the EU residue limits should not be marketed any more, because they have thereby proved, I am afraid to say, that they are uncontrollable.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are also pleased that the substitution principle, which already represented a crucial step towards better health protection when it was incorporated into the EC Chemicals Regulation, is to be enshrined in the proposed regulation too, because substitution is a particularly powerful stimulant of competition in the pesticides industry. It is scandalous and nothing short of scaremongering to sound warnings that up to half of all pesticides could disappear from the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I thank the Commission for establishing such stringent substitution criteria, for pesticides need to be improved tenfold. They should – and this is a proposal made by Parliament’s Environment Committee – be authorised for a period not exceeding five years. The Commission’s proposal, however, also regulates how we should deal with cases of resistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another key feature of the proposed regulation is better protection of sensitive groups. As we know, foetuses, babies and children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of hazardous chemicals. For this reason I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has proposed that decisions on the authorisation of active substances and the assessment of the risks they entail be made by reference to the more vulnerable groups in society.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am particularly pleased to be able to tell you that we have also introduced rules on labelling, because food products that are not compliant with Directive 2006/215 must carry an indication to that effect. That is a giant step towards greater transparency, for studies, and in particular a study conducted by environmental NGOs in the parliamentary supermarket, have shown just how risky products, notably everyday products, can be. Measured values were up to 200 times higher than the levels normally prescribed for infant and baby food.</p>
      <p sl="de">Greater transparency for the sake of these vulnerable groups, but also for consumers and people living near farmland, means greater support for Europe as a whole too, because there must be no more prodding about in the dark when it comes to traceability. Reports, lists of licensed pesticides, residue readings and, above all, toxicological and ecotoxicological data must be made accessible to everyone almost in real time, and local residents must be informed of imminent crop-spraying through a central information system. The pesticide passport will make it possible to trace, through wholesale and retail outlets, which pesticide was used when. That will create competition, and consumers, of course, will be the main beneficiaries of competition between manufacturers producing only safe products.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another of our aims is that this regulation should ensure high environmental standards. This is why the Environment Committee came out against the idea of dividing Europe arbitrarily into three zones that are not based on any environmental or climatic criteria or on landscape types. Moreover, Commissioner, the idea did not win majority support in the Council. Like the Council, we advocate better voluntary cooperation in Europe on product licensing. Let me also reiterate that there are strong legal reservations, because no intergovernmental agreements exist within these zones to enforce mandatory mutual recognition of pesticide licences. Such provisions exist in the EU context on the basis of the European treaties, but there is no legal framework for mutual recognition within the defined zones.</p>
      <p sl="de">People in Europe do not want poison on their plates. I hope that this regulation will also improve Europe’s standing as a business location, because it will make Europe a better place for consumers to live, and it will be universally beneficial – not only to the environment and consumers and in terms of animal welfare, but above all to manufacturers and farmers, since they will receive more incentives to innovate and become more competitive.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I would like to express my warmest thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who have collaborated on this report in a truly cooperative manner. I hope that this new pesticides regulation will enable us to raise health and environmental protection to new heights in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . – Mr President, we have to face up to the very practical idea that we need to produce food in Europe – last month we reduced set-aside to zero to bring 10% of land back into production – and we need the necessary tools to do that job.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are all quite happy to want safe food and safe chemicals, but – and the Commission is dealing with this in the right way – this has to be done on a risk-based system similar to that used for REACH: if a chemical is safe to use then it can be used, but if it is not safe to use then it should be taken off the market. That is how we should deal with this the whole way through.</p>
      <p sl="en">Climatic conditions make a great deal of difference to when you should spray, so you need flexibility in when and how you spray. There are now satellite systems which can introduce the spray at the right time, and you can actually reduce the amount of spray and chemical you use. Take for instance this year, which was an extremely wet year in many parts of Europe. In my own country, Britain, you cannot buy organic potatoes because you could not spray them and could not keep the blight away from them. There are, therefore, very few organic potatoes to be had. We need the necessary tools, and that is why we cannot go for a percentage-based reduction each year. We have got to go for a sensible, risk-based system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, when it comes to the 10-metre strips, there are – believe it or not – chemicals that you can use in water courses. There is a chemical called Roundup which can actually be sprayed on the banks of a river or a stream. Are we going to ban its use on a 10-metre strip next to a stream when it can actually be used on the banks of a stream? Let us be sensible about this. We need food security, we need food production and we need safe food in Europe. Let us all work together to achieve that.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I think that one minute for two opinions is very short, but all right, I shall try and keep it as brief as possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Pesticides are useful and necessary and without these products it is becoming difficult to feed 6 billion people. Certainly there is still a great deal to be done to combat the harmful environmental and health effects of pesticides. Bringing new products onto the market is a long and always expensive process. It is good for the industry that approvals can be dealt with more quickly, but Parliament is rightly asking that Member States should have the right to refuse products in their territory.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The industry is focusing increasingly on the major crops, the ‘big five’, rice, corn, maize, soya beans and cotton, because with those they can recover a lot of the cost. But it is of course important for the minor crops to be properly protected and the Committee on Industry has made a number of good suggestions for that. The Committee is also making a number of good suggestions to introduce incentives to switch to more sustainable products. That is also very important.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have another comment to make on the use of pesticides. The compulsory buffer zone of 10 metres from surface water is not a good idea for some Member States. I therefore welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group on that point. Surface water is now one of the assessment criteria for approval and on that basis Member States have the right to establish a buffer zone for products themselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All in all, I think that this is a balanced and workable position for Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Commission proposal on this report had a dual legal basis, namely Article 37(2) on agricultural policy, and Article 152(4)(b) on health protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied these proposals. For example, a proposal was made by the Committee responsible to remove Article 37(2) and incorporate Article 175(1), by removing Article 37(2), retaining Article 152(4)(b) and adding Article 175(1).</p>
      <p sl="es">The key aspect as far as the legal basis is concerned, is for the debate to be geared to the aim and content, and the Committee on Legal Affairs is of the unanimous opinion that the applicable article is Article 152(4)(b), there being no need to refer to Article 175(1).</p>
      <p sl="es">In our view, this is perfectly clear and there is no need either for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Commission or for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Committee responsible; all that is required is a reference to Article 152(4)(b), because the purpose of this proposal for a directive is the protection of human health.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as draftswoman of my Committee’s opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market, I should like to comment on the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this proposal for a regulation, it is important that we should strike a balance between the following interests: on the one hand, there are the interests of consumers in healthy food without residues, in other words in safe plant protection products that do not endanger public health and the environment, and in clean drinking water; on the other hand, consumers also have an interest in a reliable supply of fresh and affordable products, and they want home-grown fruit and vegetables rather than those from countries outside the EU, given that there are scarcely any checks on the pesticides that have been used those countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our farmers need certain plant protection products if they are to combat resistance. That cannot be done, however, without a certain number of protection products. At the same time they want safe, risk-free protection products. This is why we also believe that demonstrably carcinogenic substances must be banned. As regards the other licensing criteria, however, we intend to rely on scientific evidence and base our approach on maximum values. That is a balanced midway position that protects our consumers while guaranteeing that home-grown fruit and vegetables are affordable as well as being subject to adequate testing.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as informing neighbours is concerned, if we have stringent licensing criteria and if we test plant protection products properly, I cannot see why we have to go through bureaucratic procedures to alert neighbours and local residents to the use of plant protection products when they have not even asked for information. What are consumers supposed to make of such information? How, in practice, are farmers supposed to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before they apply plant protection products? It is for these reasons that I argue passionately against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would impose this very requirement, and I also advocate rejection of the Commission’s proposed public information clause at this point, for if we have safe plant protection products we have no need for these bureaucratic procedures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me make a very brief comment on the zonal approach. We are seeking greater harmonisation. That is the main point for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection too. The provisions proposed in the Breyer report would result in 27 national licensing zones. Our aim, after all, is harmonisation with due regard to the opinions of the Member States, which could adapt this authorisation to their own conditions of use. I therefore urge the House to support this harmonisation effort and to back the Commission’s zoning proposal.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the subject being discussed, the use and placing on the market of sustainable pesticides, is a very important one. It embraces both the practice of sustainable agriculture and matters of public health. It is therefore regrettable that the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development should not be taking part in this debate right now.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Over the millennia mankind has had to contend with pests, vermin, weeds and plant and crop disease. They have reduced harvests and rendered them unfit for human consumption. In recent decades the struggle has been overcome to some extent, mainly on account of new plant protection products. At the same time, however, there has been a threat to health.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The proposals for a directive now before us are very rigid. Generally speaking, the purpose of the new regulations is to improve the situation regarding public health. However, no clear analytical illustration of the dangers of plant diseases and weeds which pesticides are used to try and prevent has been put forward. This is a huge drawback because in this case what is best may not be what is right. The sustainable practice of agriculture could be set back years. Not using pesticides is not necessarily a good option, even as far as public health is concerned.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is an important, complex and tricky subject that we are debating today. Combating the pests that devour and damage crops is a necessary challenge in terms of both food security and the protection and improvement of our environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sensible recourse to pesticides is therefore unavoidable. It is essential, however, that the associated risks should be assessed in a balanced way, particularly with regard to human health, and that measures to scale down pesticide use should be properly planned. The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is, in my view, a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face, and I should like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Irena Belohorská, and to record my appreciation of the close cooperation that went into the drafting of the text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Certain comments are called for: the core problem of risk management is inseparable from the question of how much pesticide is used. The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle. In respect of other pesticides, we have to apply subsidiarity. Working within a common European framework, it will be the responsibility of the Member States to set their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used. National action plans will also facilitate adaptation to particular circumstances in each country. It is extremely important, too, to protect the aquatic environment and we must be rigorous here by establishing buffer zones fixed in accordance with local conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would point out that the system we wish to implement is a logical follow-on to the REACH directive. With regard to pesticide quantities, the thrust of our argument should be ‘as little as possible and as much as necessary’.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, my British fellow Members sometimes use the expression ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’. This is the way it should be! Fruit and vegetables are normally healthy types of food, but unfortunately this is not always the case. In far too many cases there are pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables and naturally this has direct negative consequences for human health. The subject that we are concerned with here is therefore very important. Consequently, it is very important that we use these substances in a sustainable manner, so that we can reduce their usage in those cases where we use too many pesticides. Our nature, environment and health are being damaged, and groundwater sources may also be contaminated.</p>
      <p sl="da">Therefore, I also believe there is reason to criticise the Commission, particularly because you, Mr Kyprianou, are known (in my country, too) as a man who is very concerned with consumer interests and have done a considerable amount to safeguard the environment and health. I do not understand how you can stand here today and defend a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and will also force European countries to reduce their levels of consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="da">Allow me simply to give a couple of examples of what this will mean if we accept the proposal that you have put forward. In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted. We have reduced the use of pesticides by around 50% since the beginning of the 1980s. I am sure you will agree that this is a very sensible thing to do. If your proposal is implemented, we will be forced to double the number of pesticides permitted in Denmark. Double the number of pesticides! This will probably mean that we will find it very difficult to continue drinking our groundwater untreated as we do today.</p>
      <p sl="da">I do not view this issue purely as a national one. I speak on behalf of the entire Socialist Group in the European Parliament and fortunately also on behalf of the vast majority who made their views clear through the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. There are many examples. In every single zone, it is of course the case that every country apart from one will be forced to approve pesticides that they do not currently approve. Let me give an example of one crop: maize. In the UK a maize pesticide is used that contains around 15 active substances. In Hungary 57 active substances are used, while in Poland 37 are used. However, if the Commission’s proposals are implemented every country will therefore approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances. This means that in the UK the level will be quadrupled. It should not be the EU’s task to force countries to use more pesticides. It will affect the environment, it will affect health and it will affect groundwater. Surely this cannot be the intention.</p>
      <p sl="da">I hope that you will back up what we have proposed in the Committee on the Environment; this will also make life easier for the industry. It is in the compromise that we have adopted in the Committee on the Environment: we will say no to the mutual obligatory approval of pesticides, but yes to the mutual obligatory approval of data. Moreover, we are talking not only about zones, but also about data throughout Europe. This will make life much easier for the industry. At the same time, we are actually giving countries the right to say no if they have climatic conditions that require them to do so.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, with regard to the reduction targets, I would like to say to Mr Dimas that it is unbelievably positive that we are getting rid of the most dangerous substances – substances that cause cancer, substances that affect child development, etc. Naturally we would like to remove these substances from the market. They are also completely unnecessary. In addition, I think that we should go a step further and also establish a general reduction target for all substances. Of course this should be something that is determined individually in each country, but if we simultaneously link this with the European reduction targets of around 20%, I think we are being ambitious. However, in spite of everything I still believe we are at a stage where it is possible. It will be of great significance for health and the environment in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="da">With regard to the justification that has been used by the Commission for not introducing these reduction targets, we have introduced a treatment frequency index that takes account of the points that you have otherwise emphasised.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that a number of Member States have already initiated measures to reduce pesticide-related risks, but trends in pesticide use differ from one country to another. For example, certain substances, the use of which is banned in some Member States, are none the less on sale in those states because their use is permitted in other states. There is a clear need to harmonise the rules here in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union. The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides, whilst recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have a number of amendments that are intended to make the text more easily applicable, while sticking to the principle that safer or non-chemical alternatives should be encouraged. My group is keen to focus the volume-reduction targets on dangerous substances. We co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans, setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some may think it paradoxical that my group has tabled a further amendment, also to Article 4, offering Member States the option of an approach based on risk reduction. This is, in fact, a more realistic approach but the calculations are more difficult than they are with volume reduction. We thought it was important to put forward this amendment because the question is one that we would wish to see addressed in the interinstitutional discussions after the vote at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should now like to consider a few specific points. For the protection of watercourses it would seem more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment, rather than fixing a minimum buffer-zone area. It is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks, children’s playgrounds and school areas because the use of pesticides in proximity to such areas should be restricted to the minimum necessary, or indeed be prohibited, and non-chemical methods should be prioritised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the fraught question of aerial spraying, the European Commission’s proposal – for a ban in principal with exceptions that must be justified – made a lot of sense. The text from the Committee on the Environment is, however, acceptable. Whilst I understand the need to notify the public of pesticide spraying, I think it has to be left to the Member States to determine the nature and extent of the notification and the means of giving it. We are dealing here with so many different types of terrain and so many different approaches that any attempt to standardise seems unrealistic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ALDE Group is thus seeking to achieve a balance, the essence of which is that no single party, whether user or manufacturer, should be penalised but rather that rigorous and consistent legislation should be introduced: allowing pesticide users to protect their crops; allowing manufacturers to sell products that will gradually become less harmful; and allowing consumers not only to eat safe food but also to live in a safe environment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the three reports that have been presented are inextricably linked. The European Union is trying to do as much as possible to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and to prevent their accumulation in the soil, in water and in plants. A great deal has been done in the last few years to minimise these effects. A particularly important role in this work has been played by research organisations that have created modern preparations that work more selectively. However, we should remember that in past years the quality of pesticides was much worse, they were used in much higher doses, many times higher, and, as a result, the pollution in our environment is a consequence of activities in years past. For this reason, in addition to the new directives, we must supplement existing legislation with a directive on the deactivation and disposal of outdated pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would ask for your active participation in this matter since, despite the passage of some years, problems are still increasing instead of decreasing, and the risks are increasing instead of decreasing, as was shown at the last NGO forum in Kishinev.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioners, whilst I should like to congratulate Ms Breyer on the excellent outcome she has achieved, I cannot support those who defend the use of pesticides, because it is absolutely vital that we rid our environment and our bodies of these dangerous substances. I hope that the European Parliament may in future support the most forward-looking positions on this question, instead of yielding to the latest siren calls from manufacturers representing a deadly industry. Eliminating carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic pesticides, and substances that weaken our nervous and endocrine systems and damage our immune systems, is an entirely healthy aim.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should also welcome our fellow Members’ efforts to ensure transparency in the provision of information for consumers, who are the ‘innocent victims’ of these dangerous substances. Surely, Commissioners, it is high time that action was taken? Never before have insecticides, fungicides and herbicides of various types been used as systematically as they are used today. To look no further than France, a situation that can only be described as ‘joint management’ of public policy on pesticides by the state and the chemical industry has succeeded thus far in marginalising ordinary people’s expectations about public and environmental health, regardless of research findings on environmental toxicity and at the expense of statistical studies if they establish links between chemical substances and pathological conditions: all this despite recent warnings from the medical profession, via the Paris Appeal for example, and the Grenelle Forum on Environment in France. The industry is doing its utmost to play down the impact of pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, after the pollution of water courses by the herbicide Atrazine, which everyone has heard about, and the decimation of bee populations, the chemical industry is trying to draw a veil over the fact that France remains the European Union’s number one pesticide user. Every year, between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into our environment in France. So, in relation to the ‘pesticides package’ – unlike the REACH directive – the Members of this House will not allow themselves to be discredited. Ordinary people expect no less of us: that is clear from the mass of correspondence we receive, calling for swift and strong action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We hear, for example, from people highlighting the dangers of inhaling pesticides that are sprayed by vegetable growers in the south of France, and from others concerned about heavy use of herbicides in public parks and gardens, prompting some to call for pesticide-free zones.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Belohorská, on her report on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that the rapporteur succeeded in preparing a document that makes provision for, and strikes the right balance between, the need for sustainable competitive agricultural production in Europe, and promoting the use of pesticides only where there is minimum adverse effect on human health and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I welcome the fact that the report incorporates the amendment on the precautionary principle regarding human health and safeguarding of the land and water ecosystem, which I co-authored.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, in the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns on the one hand and the interests of producers and consumers on the other hand. I should like to talk about several aspects of these reports in more detail.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One of the proposals is that the policy should be based on reducing use. I am very sceptical about this. You can certainly reduce the total quantity of pesticides, but often it is the most used pesticides that are the least dangerous. In that case the risks are still more or less equal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am much more in favour of a policy based on reducing the risk. The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and it has been found to reduce the environmental risk by 86%. Another disadvantage of reducing use is that fewer different pesticides are available and resistance builds up more quickly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another point is the introduction of buffer zones around watercourses. An amendment to create a 10-metre buffer zone has been approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. For a country with a lot of water like the Netherlands, that 10 metres is a problem. It means in effect that 35% of agricultural land cannot be sprayed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally I would like to point out that it is not only a standard that is important; enforcement is undoubtedly important. At the moment that is lacking, as can be seen from the products intended for consumption we regularly come across that do not meet the standard, even in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as we all know, it has long been presumed that a connection exists between pesticides used in agriculture or genetically modified foodstuffs on the one hand and various diseases on the other. When pesticides are even being found here and there in drinking water, it is undoubtedly high time to make the slow-grinding wheels of EU bureaucracy turn faster.</p>
      <p sl="de">It remains to be seen how far we can actually go towards achieving the present aim of reducing the application of plant protection agents. We are all familiar, of course, with ambitious aims that are not achieved in the end. I do believe, however, that the intended replacement of carcinogenic substances is far from the great achievement it is volubly proclaimed to be; on the contrary, it is, in my view, an immediate imperative. In actual fact, the replacement of these substances is long overdue.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we consider that the EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4% of the world’s arable land, the problem becomes immediately clear. These statistics also show that our EU support schemes have patently been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is, of course, a general suspicion among consumers – and it is not entirely unfounded – that resourceful farmers are trying to circumvent the prescribed ceilings with combinations of authorised plant protection products. Given the lack of research into interaction between products, it is high time for intervention to curb such practices. Moreover, the continual increases in maximum concentrations in recent years must be reversed in view of the greater danger posed to high-risk groups such as children.</p>
      <p sl="de">Importing organic products from the opposite ends of the earth is not only inconsistent with various environmental objectives but is also one of the causes of increased traffic volumes and a perennial indictment of the Union’s misguided support policy. Our support schemes should therefore be rethought, particularly with a view to providing more support for those European farmers who refrain using pesticides. If we choose instead to go on harassing farmers with bureaucratic obstacles, no one should be surprised if they ultimately throw in the towel in frustration while Brussels is bewildered by the chronic dwindling of the farming community.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am tempted to say that a political pesticide to deal with the rampant weed that is EU regulation would do us all a favour. When I look at some of these amendments and proposals, a proposal like the 10-metre rule, I detect within it a gross degree of overkill.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have to face some facts. Without controlled use of pesticides in our agriculture, we will drive more food production to less regulated regions of the world, jeopardising quality and food safety. Perhaps of even more interest to some, without fungicides and herbicides to protect and cure disease in fine turf, many golf and bowling surfaces would become weed-infested and unplayable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, pesticides must be controlled, but our measures must be based on sound science and be practical at farm and street level.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that representatives of the agricultural sector have not been involved in this debate, as it would have been extremely interesting, in the light of the recent CAP reform, to hear the farmers’ voice as well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The task we face is not only to safeguard the future of farming in Europe and the quality and quantity of food production but also to promote research and to ensure that data are protected. The greatest challenge, of course, is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and our environment. We must also be concerned, however, with the health of farmers and their families, who need better protection as it is they who come into direct contact with these products and the advice they receive is often the advice of the companies marketing the pesticides. The companies are hardly likely to tell them that researchers have started asking questions about the link between exposure to pesticides and the steadily increasing incidence of certain conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, prostate cancer, brain tumours and congenital deformities. It will therefore be absolutely essential to establish strict rules for the placing of products on the market. We should also encourage research through proper provision for data protection, and promote research programmes on biological means of pest control – a useful example of innovation. At the end of the day these products should also be affordable for farmers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My final point, Commissioner, concerns the protection of bees: the long-term evaluations provided for in Directive 91/414 have not been carried out. Simply having rules and regulations is not good enough: they must be applied and systems are needed to ensure that they are applied. I agree that the most important thing is to regulate the placing of these products on the market but I would also make the comment, Madam President, that in the course of this impassioned debate the intrusions of lobbying by the chemical industry – although infrequent – have been disgraceful.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, all the health and environmental data now available, which I do not propose to list this evening, must necessarily prompt this House to take decisive action on pesticides and their conditions of use. It is essential that such action is based on measurable targets. It became clear in the discussions prior to the vote in plenary that there are major differences between the Member States in both their practice and their policy approach, so we ended up compromising on certain issues and relying on subsidiarity. I hope we shall not be deceived here by subsidiarity, for it will entail flexibility that could easily become a pretext for watering down our policies to a very minimal expression of the political and public will being voiced here today, particularly on the issues of exposure to risks and the extent of the buffer zones beside watercourses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If subsidiarity is to be meaningful in relation to pesticides, it must encourage more comprehensive thinking about the agricultural and environmental issues in each European region. That will mean stepping up research and the transfer of technologies; involving all the stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, NGOs, health professionals and representatives of the food industry; and carrying out thorough research in each geographical area, jointly identifying best practices and non-chemical alternatives that are suited to the soil, the climate and the crops. There are a few regions in which this work is already being done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore propose that the Commission should encourage the introduction of such an approach and should facilitate inter-regional exchanges of experience, whilst at the same time ensuring that European laws are properly applied.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, many of my fellow Members believe we need strict rules for dealing with plant protection agents, and they are right, but at the same time we must not ignore the impact of the legislation we adopt. The fact is that plant protection products are an important element of modern-day agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="de">Take the example of the regulation on authorisation. We are in the process of banning entire clusters of active substances on the basis of exclusion criteria, simply because of an abstract notion of hazardousness. This approach ignores the actual risk involved in applying these agents down on the farm. It leads us to ban active substances which do not pose any problem at all in practice. As a result, not enough active substances will be available in future to combat pests properly.</p>
      <p sl="de">If only a few active substances are used, resistance to pesticides will develop more quickly. There will be no reliable means left to deal with many pest problems. And these are probably the new heights to which Mrs Breyer just referred. When that stage is reached, the security of Europe’s food supply will plumb new depths. Instead of imposing blanket bans we should be providing for a reliable licensing procedure that examines the actual risk involved in the use of each substance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The next example relates to the strategic approach to this issue, in which we argue for an across-the-board Europe-wide reduction target for the use of plant protection products. That, however, has nothing at all to do with the risks involved in their use.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission had set targets for reducing the actual risk. That is a good idea, and we should retain it. When all is said and done, we should focus on what is feasible, namely efficient pest control coupled with proper risk management. After all, it is also a matter of establishing how the growing need for raw vegetable materials is to be met in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past innovative plant protection products have helped to make production grow faster than demand for arable land. Our aim for the future should not be to reverse this situation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I do not think you could find a single person in this House, in this Parliament, who would claim that ecology, a healthy environment and human health was not important. I do not believe that any European citizen would ever say that.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, ladies and gentlemen, while making decisions, talking about legislation and making and implementing rules that hundreds of thousands of people would have to adhere to and that would no doubt have an impact on the lives of millions of people, we cannot base our decisions on emotions and good intentions. We need to achieve this objective in a balanced and sensible way. One of the key objectives set out for the EU agricultural sector is to supply good quality food at affordable prices. The EU is known for the high standards of food production and strict farming regulations it lays down for its Member States. On the other hand, there is constant pressure on EU agriculture to be competitive as well as to produce good quality food.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We are in no position to ignore these factors when discussing plant protection regulations. The opinion expressed by the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has satisfied the expectations of all interested parties. Nevertheless, the amendments proposed, or those introduced at the time of the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, have raised serious concerns.</p>
      <p sl="lt">If these amendments are accepted, the consequences could be unpredictable. They pose risks not only for agriculture and the food industry, but also for nature itself. Does it mean that genetically modified organisms will enter the EU market? The impact on traditional crops would be huge if 90% of plant protection products were excluded from the market.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, once again I urge you to base your decision on sound scientific evidence and good practice, not on rumours and emotions. I hope that your vote will reflect the opinion of all interested parties and that the outcome will be balanced and correct, so that agriculture is not destroyed, EU citizens are not left without European food and millions of people do not end up unemployed in the name of environmental protection.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, early tomorrow morning I am going to the grocer’s to buy bottled drinking water. In many countries people do this because the groundwater sources have been contaminated by pollution. The water is subject to chemical treatment as if it were a dirty coat. Then it is chlorinated and tastes as bad as it is expensive. In Denmark we have a rich vein of gold underground: clean groundwater. We drink it directly as drinking water without first sending it to a water treatment works. It is healthier than bottled water, it tastes better and it is much, much cheaper.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, this also means that we must watch over it and prohibit pesticide sprays in cases where the pesticide could enter the groundwater. Therefore, Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays, 12 of which are found in drinking water. This is something that we would like to continue with and I therefore request that my fellow Members vote in favour of an amendment to permit protection zones. We have already had the proposal adopted in previous regulations; these must now be repeated in order to prevent them from being annulled. Finally, we have received support from a large majority here in Parliament and subsequently from the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso. Thank you! We have received no support from the Danish Commissioner for Agriculture, who, together with the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (also from the Danish Liberal Party (Venstre)), would rather support the farmers’ opportunity to ruin our drinking water. It is sad that the Danish Agricultural Council would rather support Venstre. It is very short-sighted to pursue slightly higher corn yields and then have to pay billions of kroner in order to purify the groundwater. The Treaty states that polluters themselves will pay. I have proposed this in an amendment and I request that my fellow Members support the requirements of the Treaty. No-one has the right to poison our common earth and drinking water.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioners, the proposal for a regulation drawn up by the European Commission to replace Directive 91/414/CE achieves greater harmonisation of authorisation procedures while at the same time providing for consumer protection. However, the result obtained in the Environment Committee not only fails to have regard to the objective of greater harmonisation but unjustifiably overhauls measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union. Farmers, however, are not the only ones who will suffer: consumers are likely to suffer as well, because many crops will become unviable, making imports necessary, with a knock-on effect for food security.</p>
      <p sl="es">Insufficient consideration has been given to the fact that the approval and use of plant protection products is already subject to strict controls, both by the European Food Safety Authority and by the competent authorities of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, this proposal changes the number of active substances from 1 100 as authorised in 1991, to 148, which are listed in Annex I to this proposal. Of those 148 substances, only 34 are insecticides, nematocides or acaricides, which are the substances most needed for cultivation in Mediterranean Europe where the level of attack by insects is the highest in the entire Union. Insects are not only a menace to plants, but are also transmitters of very serious human illnesses.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission proposal to divide the European Union into three zones for the mutual recognition of plant protection products should be reinstated. Criteria for precluding pesticides must be based on proper risk analyses. Without a risk analysis it is impossible to determine the effect of these substances on health or the environment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I have been stressing the importance of this evening’s debate because what we have at stake here today is nothing less than our vision of Europe’s farming future and the need to move away from intensive agriculture that clearly causes too much pollution, towards sustainable agriculture that will respect biodiversity. This is a challenge to which Europe must rise for three reasons: firstly, as more scandals and more health risks are uncovered, public opinion is now set against the use of pesticides; secondly the majority of farmers themselves want the European Union to help them change their practices so that they no longer have to choose between keeping their health and boosting their profitability; and thirdly, bee-keepers all over Europe are calling for strict legislation to stop the sale of pesticides that have not been evaluated for their impact on bees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore vital that the ambitious stance taken by the Committee on the Environment should be confirmed in tomorrow’s vote on the three reports by Hiltrud Breyer, Christa Klaß and Irena Belohorská. We must confirm that health and the environment are foremost; that specific measures are needed to protect those most vulnerable to harm; that the most dangerous substances will be covered by the precautionary principle; that the use of non-chemical alternatives will indeed be encouraged; and that aerial spraying will henceforth be banned in principle. In short, we must translate into practical action the concerns voiced by the very many men and women in Europe who – as Mrs Isler-Béguin has mentioned – have written to us urging that farming should not in future be dependent on chemicals.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the use of plant protection products – pesticides – is essential in certain circumstances. In Poland there is a preponderance of small agricultural holdings, where the owners, due to insufficient finance, economise on expensive pesticides and this sometimes results in losses as a result of pests.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am in favour of all actions to encourage the rational use of plant protection products, including advice, training, research, subsidies for modern plant protection equipment, the introduction of substitute products that help to protect the environment and health and that are compatible with farmers’ interests, instead of the use of pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Where there is a risk that the harvest might be lost, ignorance and the lack of proper assistance to farmers can lead to the uncontrolled use of pesticides. A problem that has been with us for a long time, but which has not yet been fully resolved, is the issue of the disposal of dumps of highly toxic pesticides that exist or existed in the countries of the former Soviet bloc, as well as the recultivation of soil. They are poisoning both the water and the soil. This baggage could reduce the effectiveness of the measures prepared in these documents.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, producers who are being forced to create food that looks perfect are introducing pesticides that are harmful not just to the environment and to the economy, but also to human health. I hope that the documents under discussion will lead to an improvement in the quality of food consumed and will encourage more organic production methods, with greater use of natural fertilisers to nurture the soil. In addition, as regards the unscrupulous and unethical practice of exporting substances known to be harmful to third world countries, I would quote a popular proverb from Poland: ‘Do as you would be done by’. This is even more important because the dangerous pesticides come back to us in the form of foodstuffs that are purchased cheaply by wealthy countries and destroy people’s health.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition to the general guidelines, strategies for the sustainable use of pesticides should be developed at national level, where appropriate action can be taken. Reductions in the quantity of plant protection products should be greater in areas where more pesticides are used.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I highly value the fact that all three reports require the personnel involved in all phases of pesticide handling to be highly qualified. Action plans, integrated management and strict import measures: these are also examples of what is positive in all the reports. However, both the bans on aerial application and, alternatively, the situations where aerial application would be possible must be articulated precisely, using clear wording.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Similarly, the notion of a quantitative use reduction is not clearly defined and opens the door to many risks because of its non-selective application. For example, the Slovak Republic applies on average less than 1 kg of pesticides per hectare while other countries apply as much as 8 kg. This means that there are countries where pesticide use must be genuinely reduced and countries where pesticide use should even be increased. This is why I suggest that when voting we should take into account the recommendations of the European Crop Protection Association or alternatively, at first reading, not adopt reports A6-0347/2007 and A6-0359/2007 and keep the balanced recommendations of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for us to give shape to the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides and it is also a good idea for us to put some of it into effect immediately. In view of the considerable impact on food quality, public health, the environment and the sustainability of our farming – all matters of concern – our whole group, as well as our rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, have devoted a great deal of time to this package. I should like to mention four points in particular.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, a further reduction in pesticide use is sensible. This must then actually create less of an impact on the environment and for that reason we are against merely reducing the quantity used. We want a reduction in the actual impact, based on a scientific risk evaluation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, we take a similar view on non-spray zones around watercourses. Here again we are in favour of a risk-based approach and we feel that the Member States are better able than we are to make responsible choices, based partly on the criteria laid down in the water framework directive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, I wonder why this Parliament, which is after all an advocate of an internal market with a high degree of protection for the consumer, health and the environment, would oppose a first step towards harmonisation in this area. We are in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would also like to see voluntary mutual recognition between zones.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, we are opposed to the general provision of information to neighbours advocated by Mrs Breyer in her report. Not only is that information unnecessary for a strictly regulated activity, it also causes unnecessary anxiety and frustration. Surely the aim cannot be to move towards a sort of private enforcement. That is a society we do not want and do not support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, today’s debate is of enormous significance for European agriculture and for environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There are many people in favour of the use of pesticides and many who are opposed. However, I believe that the farmers’ guiding principle should be: ‘as few pesticides as possible, just those that are essential’, and the guiding principle of producers and distributors should be the precautionary principle, which should be the supreme principle as regards the lives and the health of consumers in every case where the introduction of new pesticides raises concerns, either because there is some ambivalence in the results of scientific research, or if there has been insufficient time to be able to say categorically that a given product or substance is harmless to humans and animals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the context of sustainable use of pesticides, I believe that the following steps should be taken: first of all, the Commission as well as Member States should provide periodic training, and advisory and educational programmes that are financed at least in part by companies that manufacture pesticides. There should be coordinated monitoring and data collection with regard to the harmful effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, and this should include long-term research programmes and the imposition of sanctions on polluters. A coordinated system should be set up to collect data on the production, import, export, sales, distribution and use of pesticides, and this should be accessible to the public. Agricultural practices that promote the use of low doses of pesticides should be encouraged, which will help change the overall usage of these preparations. Appropriate checks should be introduced and the import into the EU of agricultural food products produced with the aid of chemicals should be banned.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, plant protection products are still essential for agricultural production and food supplies in Europe. The big question when we in Europe take particular measures is what kind of influence this has on competitive relations with the rest of the world. If we are too strict in Europe and cannot impose the same rules on the rest of the world, that means that we in Europe can consume products that we are unable to produce here, which seems wrong to me.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course it is always essential for us to continue evaluating the harmful effects, but we cannot overdo it. I agree with everyone who says that we should concentrate on the risk and not on reducing the quantity. The 10-metre buffer zones will also be disastrous for the Netherlands and others and should be left out of the regulation.</p>

The golf and field sports industry says that without pesticides it is not possible to maintain the turf. The Crop Protection Agency says that banning pesticides means between 65% and 200% more land under cultivation, reducing productivity. Corbett Farms say that this year has shown the value of spraying to prevent potato blight. Pesticides are expensive and the lowest amount is used to protect our crop. Decisions on how and when to spray must be taken on an individual field basis. An arbitrary reduction in use cannot be scientifically based.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. It goes without saying that all of us care deeply about health and consumer protection, and the strength of feeling among the various Members of our House can be gauged from this highly charged debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is nevertheless important that we really do decide on the basis of the facts and do not fly in the face of reality by creating scapegoats, as it were. It would be very easy, especially with this legislative package, to pick on a particular occupational group and look no further. That would be completely wrong. It must be established from the outset that all of us in Europe need a functioning agricultural sector, which necessarily entails the use of a certain quantity of plant protection agents.</p>
      <p sl="de">On specific aspects of the Klaß report, let me say that it is indeed a sound principle to envisage certain reduction targets, but I believe the quantitative approach adopted here is simply too rigid. Every Member State should truly consider what it can do itself, because merely reducing the overall volume and believing this will clean up the environment is downright unscientific. As far as the buffer strips are concerned, there is nothing wrong with the Commission’s chosen strategy of treating subsidiarity as the key element. Every Member State should consider how it wants these buffer strips regulated. Blindly imposing a Community-wide ten-metre border would be wrong. Trying to find non-chemical alternatives in sensitive areas, such as habitats of rare flora and fauna, is also an approach that should be supported unreservedly.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the Breyer report, it is important that we support the three-zone concept. Restricting the scope of licences to single Member States would be an excessively narrow approach. Special care is needed with regard to the exclusion criteria. An unequivocal ban for CMR1-rated substances may be taken as read, but in the case of CMR2 substances I am also in favour of taking scientific data as a basis for licensing decisions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative proposal which we will be asked to vote on aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment by establishing Community models for the sustainable use of pesticides and rules for placing them on the European market.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that by supporting the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety’s proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20% in Europe, we are sending out a strong message. We must strengthen checks on the rational use of pesticides, and, most importantly, promote research into safer alternative methods of plant protection.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, the proposal for abolition of the system of zones and mandatory mutual licensing is a balanced position.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on these three reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I believe that we in Europe need to be in a position whereby we can produce European crops and European fruit and vegetables that are safe for human consumption. However, we need to achieve that objective in a balanced way and in a common-sense way, so that we protect human health without penalising agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we do not want is to put restrictions in place that impact negatively on European agriculture and to end up having to import huge quantities of food with all the implications for food miles, and, of course, with little control over the quantities of pesticides used in the production of that imported food.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products are challenging legislative projects and are a reflection of the fundamental challenge that EU environmental policy faces, which is how to combine the protection of the environment with that of health effectively in a policy which takes account of social realities</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to recognise that the use of plant protection products and pesticides has major economic benefits. The expert use of these substances is, to be honest, a crucial prerequisite for food production in the modern age. At the same time, however, the adverse impact of plant production products on the environment, and on watercourses in particular, is a very real one. How, then, can we use these substances in a way which still allows us to benefit from pesticides but which at the same time reduces the adverse effects?</p>
      <p sl="fi">I come from a country where farming is a respected occupation and where domestic agriculture is regarded as important. On the other hand, the environment is particularly fragile. For example, Finland has almost 200 000 lakes, hundreds of thousands of other watercourses, and one of the world’s most polluted seas. Diffuse water pollution is an immense environmental problem, and plant protection products are part of that problem. It is a challenging equation and so it is only right that the directive should take the differences between Member States into consideration. Obviously, we need certain EU-wide standards, but the remedies applied in Finland cannot be the same as those in Luxembourg, say.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Therefore, reason and environmental concerns dictate that we should concentrate on the targets and leave the means to the Member States themselves. A good example of this is the ‘buffer zones’, which undoubtedly have an important part to play in the protection of watercourses. I am confident that buffer zones suited to each situation and consistent with the Commission’s proposals are the right way forward. If we now decide upon precisely measured limits, applying the ‘one size fits all’ principle, there is a real danger that in many countries they will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. Perhaps I should say, rather, that they would not be addressing the problem flexibly or satisfactorily.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, there are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from our fellow members here today. Therefore, I am glad to be able to speak for a second time. There are three misunderstandings. The first concerns a reduction target: some fellow members are saying that this is simply not possible. There are differences between the countries and it is not possible to create a common European reduction target. No, this cannot be done! Nor is this what we are doing. What we are doing is saying that the common European reduction target should be 20%. However, this may of course mean 30% in some countries and 10% in others. The national reduction target will be established on the basis of national action plans. Therefore, it is a misunderstanding to fear this item. A key element is that we are taking account of the fact that a gram of one pesticide can sometimes be more dangerous than an entire kilogram of another pesticide. Therefore, we have introduced a treatment frequency index as part of this reduction obligation. I can well imagine that the Commission will also have something to say about this when you, Mr Dimas, are able to speak again in a little while.</p>
      <p sl="da">The second misunderstanding concerns the zones. There is a belief that if we do not have the zones it will almost be an insult to the internal market. No, on the contrary! By ending this foolish idea about zones and saying that we will gradually introduce mutual data sharing we are saying that the entire EU is a zone within which we share data. However, it is clear that we cannot talk about mutual obligatory recognition of pesticides simply because there are different geographical, climatic and environmental circumstances in each individual country. I think that almost everyone in this House who has spoken today will be in agreement on this point.</p>
      <p sl="da">The third fundamental misunderstanding is that it will destroy the competitiveness of agriculture. No! In Denmark we have reduced the use of pesticides by 50% since the 1980s without any effect on agricultural competitiveness. Pesticides are expensive to use and therefore, provided they are used correctly, the less they are used the better it is for competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, time is short and I am speaking primarily to express my support for the co-rapporteur of the Breyer report in the PPE-DE Group, Erna Hennicot-Schoepges. I think it is very unfortunate that the majority of my group chose to ignore Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges’ advice on several important points, and not to support important proposals contained in the report. Of course, I agree that the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work, but it is not reasonable to conclude that we do not need any information requirement at all. Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges’ proposal here, as a compromise, is well-balanced.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another important issue is the cut-off criteria for particularly sensitive substances. Above all, in our decision we must of course be consistent with the decisions taken by Parliament in relation to the new REACH chemicals legislation. One of the fundamental principles there was to phase out substances where it is difficult to establish thresholds for risks in the case of high-level concern substances. Obviously we must also follow that line here, particularly as we are dealing with substances that come into contact or are liable to come into contact with things we eat.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another issue on which I support the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, is the proposal on zoning. When I saw the Commission’s proposal, I immediately found it interesting to try to divide Europe into zones that are relatively similar in terms of vegetation conditions, climate and so on. However, the proposed zoning is unfortunately too arbitrary. I cannot support this approach and believe that the Member States must be allowed to retain a right to refuse different preparations even if countries nearby have given them the green light. I would like to address other issues, but my time is over.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, when I walk out of my village I am in the middle of a unique agricultural area, the green heart between big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht. It is still green farming land at the moment, but the 10-metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would make it virtually impossible to farm in the area, when it is specifically farming that keeps the area green.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last week I put it to the test, but I was hardly able to find any pieces of land between the many ditches that were 20 metres wide. Anyone who knows a bit about the Netherlands knows that it is not only in the green heart that this is true. It is a characteristic of Dutch farming that there are many ditches between pastureland. That means that, with 10-metre buffer zones, the Netherlands would lose 800 000 hectares of its farmland, 35% of agricultural area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am therefore asking Members not to support this proposal, also in view of the agricultural production that is necessary in Europe and the world, as the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has said. That does not actually mean that I do not agree with the aim of protecting nature and public health. We all share that ambition. I just think it can be better achieved with an approach based on risk analysis and risk reduction.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The alternative, reducing use, certainly sounds nice and simple – a 20% reduction overall – but it does not provide the best protection for the consumer because it can be looked at only in terms of quantities and not the final effect, the final risk. In that context, I actually find it difficult to understand the painful contortions of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which is in favour of a 20% overall reduction as well as a risk approach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have two final points. All I will say about the licensing system is that three climate zones are preferable to 27 Member States, obviously taking national circumstances into account. Finally, I would ask the Commission not to overlook minor crops in all these major areas of dispute.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, pesticide residues are now everywhere: in food, in water, in the air, in our body tissue and breast milk and – most frighteningly of all – in the bodies of our unborn children. We are only just beginning to glimpse the long-term consequences of this omnipresence of pesticide residues: they include various forms of cancer, endocrine disorders, reduced male fertility, damage to our immune systems, and degenerative diseases of the nervous system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, yes and yes again: let us reduce pesticide use and let us reduce it quickly. I fully support the proposals made by my colleague Mrs Hennicot on the Breyer report and, in the interests of saving time, I will highlight a further point which I consider vital and which has been discussed in the PPE Group – namely notification of people living near areas that are to be treated with pesticides. I believe that a section of our group is being unreasonable in recommending that no such notification is required, on the pretext that if the substances to be applied have prior approval it means they are not harmful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Aerial spraying is commonplace, particularly in forests and vineyards. It entails a risk of substances being carried into inhabited or sensitive areas, so it must be strictly regulated. It is essential that growers should issue advance warning of pesticide spraying to people who live close by and are thus potentially exposed. People suffering from respiratory conditions such as asthma could be severely affected if they have no advance notice of such spraying. Conveying and presenting the information need not imply any additional administrative burden on farmers, as some of my fellow Members have suggested. Simple notices, stating the intended dates of the spraying, placed close to human habitation in the areas at risk, may be all that is needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to conclude by urging that it is time to move on to a new generation of agricultural practices that respect the environment and thus play a part in modernising the farming sector.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction. We should achieve this objective by implementing the guidelines in the directive on the sustainable use of pesticides. Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive. Each country should be able to do this, taking into account local conditions and differences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We differ, primarily, in the level of agricultural development, I repeat: the level of agricultural development. Those countries that are new members of the European Union often have enormous work to do to catch up as regards the level of development. A reduction in the use of pesticides in these countries, as compared with the present level of their use, will, in the final analysis, work against us as consumers, unless, in reducing their use, we take into account the present level of use of these products, which is relatively low.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our landscape is different, too. In Poland enormous areas of woodland can be protected against pests only by spraying from the air. It is a duty to the natural environment to protect these forests, and it is Parliament’s responsibility to set out guidelines for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The directive speaks a great deal about the farmer’s level of knowledge being the most important factor for the implementation of sustainable use of pesticides. It is the responsibility of us all to support education and to create the conditions so that this information can reach every farmer. In tabling an amendment concerning temporary national allowances for pesticides I am speaking in favour of the mechanism for exchanging older preparations for modern and safer ones as quickly as is possible. I would ask for your support.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The guidelines in the directive should encourage rational measures and they should not discourage Member States and farmers.</p>

    <intervention id="1-121" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Stavros Dimas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, I thank the speakers in tonight’s sitting for their positive remarks. Permit me to set out briefly the Commission’s views on certain important issues that have been raised.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me begin with the thematic strategy and, in particular, with the points not covered by the directive.</p>
      <p sl="el">First of all, I am pleased that the report supports the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides. The proposal to bring in new legislation to deal with the risky of pesticide use is particularly good.</p>
      <p sl="el">I agree with how important more research is into the impact of the combined and cumulative use of pesticides on health. In my opinion, the principle of substitution is vital; it removes the most hazardous substances from the market and replaces them with safer alternative solutions, some of which are non-chemical.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, the Belohorská report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety puts forward certain additional measures which are especially positive.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me now turn specifically to the framework directive. Many of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament make useful clarifications and can be accepted. Other amendments, however, are liable to bring about undesired results. I should like first of all to comment on the basic amendments which the Commission can fully accept in principle or in part.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission partially accepts the proposal that Member States set up individual targets in their own national action plans for the restriction of the use of the most hazardous pesticides. Indeed, setting up such targets is consistent with the directive’s general aim to reduce the risk of using pesticides. Laying down an overall, permanent target for the reduction of pesticide use at EU level, however, in addition to national targets, is not necessary and is therefore not endorsed by the Commission. In fact, the overall reduction of the quantity of pesticides does not necessarily entail a corresponding reduction in risk: the level of risk varies from one substance to another. Thus action to limit risk must focus, in the main, on the most harmful substances.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission can in principle accept the laying down of a minimum width for the buffer zones to be created in fields located next to water courses, because this will bring additional environmental gains. Imposing a limit of 10 metres, however, indiscriminately and in all cases, does not seem appropriate. The Commission would prefer Member States to have a margin of flexibility and set the appropriate width for buffer zones in line with their own geographical features.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission can also accept certain useful clarifications on other issues, such as technical training and certification. There are, however, amendments which the Commission cannot endorse.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, the Commission is convinced that mandatory adherence to common general rules on integrated pest management by professional pesticide users is a fundamental measure to reduce dependence on pesticides. It is of important environmental benefit throughout the EU and will contribute to the development of a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector. I cannot, therefore, accept the elimination under Amendment 86 of this exceptionally important measure contained in the European Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, the European Commission agrees to take measures to protect populations living close to fields where aerial spraying is carried out. Nevertheless, it considers that a complete ban on the use of pesticides in so-called ‘sensitive’ areas is disproportionate. We must leave some discretion to Member States and local authorities. If this it ever necessary, and in exceptional, rare cases, when only the use of pesticides are effective, they must be allowed to deal with risks to human health or biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, although the Commission has committed itself to looking into extending the directive’s scope of application to biocides, such a decision requires careful study, as well as the implementation of certain aspects of the directive on pesticides. When more data is made available to us through the revision programme envisaged in the directive on biocides, we will be able better to deal with the use of biocides.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fourthly, the Commission cannot support the addition of a reference to Article 152(4) of the Treaty, since the proposed directive is clearly focused on environmental protection, which already includes public health issues.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fifthly, although the imposition of taxes and contributions complies with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, there is no effective system at the moment for differentiating tax rates according to the risk posed by each pesticide. For this reason the Commission prefers that taxes and contributions should be imposed at Community level not at the present stage but until such a time as a study has been carried out into the issue.</p>
      <p sl="el">Madam President, the Commission can accept 121 amendments of the 166 that were tabled; of these it can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part. I am lodging with Parliament’s secretariat a full list of the Commission’s positions on the amendments.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me once again to thank all those who have contributed to this evening’s debate and in particular the rapporteurs for their work. Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="1-122" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Markos Kyprianou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, let me begin by reminding Members of the EU’s current fundamental policy to promote and support healthy eating. Fruit and vegetables are certainly a very important in a healthy diet. It is very important to take this on board. We have thus two aims today. We need to guarantee fruit and vegetable production and this is a golden opportunity for production and to support of agriculture. Secondly, we must ensure that fruit and vegetables are safe for consumption. We believe that the Commission’s proposal succeeds in tackling this dual challenge in a balanced fashion.</p>
      <p sl="el">I have followed the debate by all the MEPs with considerable interest. The arguments put forward are serious and we will take them properly into account. Owing to the pressure of time, I do not want to enlarge on all the issues. Let me just touch on two or three which I believe are very important and have been raised today.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, on the subject of protecting vulnerable groups, I agree that we need to protect them, and this has been taken into account in the proposed regulation. We are also willing to accept the amendment to the included definition of vulnerable groups, simply because it guarantees their even greater protection. One comment I should like to make, although not directly connected with the subject under discussion, is on imported products: I stress that they are also monitored for pesticide residues thanks to another regulation on the maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues. We have inspection rules guaranteeing consumer protection for imports too.</p>
      <p sl="el">More generally, approval criteria are a very important part of the legislation. Indeed, the proposal’s main aim is to protect the health of citizens and the environment. This is of great importance and we should not forget it. The proposed approval criteria are necessary to achieve this aim, so the Commission cannot accept any deviation from them. It is obvious from the debate and from some of the amendments that the European Parliament also shares these aims. Certain amendments would even strengthen these criteria. The Commission is of the view that the proposed criteria ought to ensure a high level of protection without making plant protection unworkable or dysfunctional. Consequently, the Commission will not be able to accept amendments which could undermine these criteria.</p>
      <p sl="el">I come finally to the controversial subject of mutual recognition, which is brought about by dovetailing the different zones in this sector. I believe that our proposal has been somewhat misconstrued. First of all, let me remind you that the new proposal will introduce stricter criteria, to be implemented on a zonal basis. We should bear this in mind, for it will ensure higher levels of protection for health and the environment. let us at the same time strive towards a single, market, internal market, thus avoiding the anomaly of a single market for agricultural products on the one hand, and a divided market for plant protection products on the other. If we bear in mind particular features relating to climate and soil, division into separate zones is inevitable. The issue is not, however, so simple and clear cut, hence I have predicted a possible misunderstanding. Whereas Member States might act to protect themselves and on the other hand, during the decision-making procedure which needs the approval of the first Member State of the zone, experts from other Member States will be able to play an active part in the licensing procedure and by doing so will be able to assess the circumstances for the entire zone. In other words, the decision will not be taken in isolation and unilaterally by a Member State belonging to the zone, but representatives of the other Member States in that zone will participate through this procedure. They will be able to present their views and to persuade others of the particular conditions prevailing in their countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me single out water protection. This is also a sensitive point which has been raised by a number of MEPs. The proposal accounts for the need to protect water resources and especially the Framework Directive on Water Policy. If it is clear from the risk assessment that under the proposed terms of use the permissible limits be exceeded in vulnerable areas, the Member State involved can and must reject the use of pesticides in that particular area. Furthermore, if the Member State can prove that all its soil is a vulnerable area, it has the option not to approve the product in question at all. Therefore, the special features and the need to protect water resources are taken clearly into account in the new regulation’s proposed procedure. For this reason, the Commission, while appreciating the comments made, would not be able to accept amendments relating to the system of approval on a zonal basis.</p>
      <p sl="el">As I have said, there are over 250 amendments, and there is no time to analyse them in detail. I see that we still have a difference of opinions, but I anticipate that the procedure and debate will enable us to find common ground.</p>

      <p sl="en">Pesticides are among the most dangerous chemicals, as they are designed to kill and they are released deliberately into the environment and onto food. Only about 1% of a pesticide actually reaches its target. Therefore, when we prepare legislation on the use and on the permitting of pesticides, we have to keep in mind what is in the interests of the different stakeholders. It is in the interests of farmers to have a high harvest and good quality products with low costs. If they can attain this goal with less pesticide, they can save on costs and provide healthier products. It is in the interests of citizens to have safe, cheap products and pesticide-free drinking water. Therefore, using less and safer pesticides is in the interests of almost everyone.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support the thrust of this report as it enhances the current legislation governing plant protection products in a way that should give consumers more confidence about the foods that they eat, it should give those in direct contact with these products such as producers, farmers, suppliers with clearer guidelines in relation to the use of pesticides and in general, it will provide for the safe production of agricultural products in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is important to point out that increasing legislation in this area will only be effective if there are sufficient checks and monitoring in Member States. Currently it would appear that while there is some monitoring for residues on food products, it may not be adequate to provide sufficient assurances to consumers of these products. Steps need to be taken to ensure that the measures foreseen under this legislation are enforced through effective monitoring.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been debating the details of this legislative package on plant protection products for a good many months. In this time we have examined numerous viewpoints and incorporated them into the text. As a result of this process, I think the draft we now have before us is one that is based on compromise in many respects and that meets as many demands as it possibly could. There are some issues, however, that should not be subject to compromise. When people’s health is at stake, economic interests cannot be allowed to take precedence. This piece of legislation is not about the competitiveness of Europe’s agricultural sector, but about protecting the health of European citizens. We have also seen that current rules in individual Member States differ widely. In my country they are among the strictest. While here in Strasbourg we have been debating whether a buffer zone of 5 or 10 metres should be established beside watercourses, Hungary has had buffer zones of 50 metres, and in some places even 500 metres, in place for decades. Moreover, although use of plant protection products by our farmers is 15 times lower than in the Netherlands, Europe’s intervention stores, when they still existed, were bursting at the seams with Hungarian maize. In view of all these things, I ask my fellow Members to use their vote tomorrow to support the introduction of strict cut-off criteria. On the basis of the compromise draft text, this would apply to a mere 29 substances out of more than 600. This is not too high a price to pay for ensuring that proven carcinogenic and toxic compounds stay off the menu. Even if there are differences as a result of specific national situations when it comes to voting, we are agreed in this regard. Let us use our vote, then, to enable us to sit down to eat with a good conscience.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Just like we have medicines for people, we also have medicines for plants: pesticides can justifiably be called that since they are medicines in the fight against diseases, pests and weeds. Of course they must be used in accordance with set rules. Incorrect application results in organism failures that manifest themselves as cancer.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, our approach to this issue must be based on scientific analysis. We must not succumb to pesticide hysteria unleashed in the European Parliament. Food self-sufficiency in Europe is falling and this is increasing the dependence of the agri-food industry on world market supplies. We must remember that a shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Following a consultation with experts, I consider some amendments of EU Directive 91/414/EEC and the Framework Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to be unworkable. These new components stray from the principle of focused and proportionate legislation based on a scientific approach.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I realise that we need harmonised European pesticide legislation to ensure that foodstuffs are safe. That said, we must not prevent farmers from using the tools they need to produce safe, nutritious and accessible food.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I cannot support the reports by Mrs Christa Klaß and Mrs Hiltrud Breyer as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I will vote for them only if the amendments by my political group, the PPE-DE, are adopted.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0354/2007) by Richard Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure, which deals with verbatim reports [2007/2137(REG) ].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-131" speaker_id="2309" name="Richard CORBETT" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="United Kingdom" birth_date="06-01-1955" birth_place="Southport" p_group="Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament" m_state="GB">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I rise to propose, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that we change the way in which we in this Parliament keep a record of our debates. We are all familiar with the verbatim report that we get the day after the debates, with each speaker’s speech rendered in their own language. That will continue as now. There will be no change to the record, in the original language, of what everybody has said.</p>
      <p sl="en">What the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is proposing is to change the way in which we preserve the multilingual record of our debates. Instead of gradually translating the debates and then, some months later, having a full written translated record in every language, we propose a switch to a system whereby the debates are electronically preserved and where any citizen can access them through the internet the very next day and see a visual record of the debate, with the soundtracks for every single language, preserved from the interpretation booths. This will provide a more lively form of access to the debates than just a dry text. It will be available immediately, rather than several months later.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must confess that I was myself initially rather sceptical of this idea. I always thought that keeping a full paper record of what everyone said, which was archived and which people could look at for many years to come, was an inherent part of being a parliament. However, on reflection, and having listened to the arguments, I am now convinced that we can keep that multilingual access, albeit in a new form.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem with the old system is that the translations not only cost a substantial amount of money but also, more importantly, are only available several months later. At the moment, they are placed on the web, where they are available electronically. They are no longer printed in the Official Journal. Very few people access them, look them up or use them, because of the time lag. With this new system of preserving the debates, on ‘web television’ if you like, they will be available the very next day, when they still have political immediacy and when people are still interested in them.</p>
      <p sl="en">We were also worried that historians, who, for all kinds of research reasons, tend to look back at parliamentary debates long after we have forgotten them, might be upset that we would no longer have a printed written version but only a visual multilingual version. We wrote to various associations of historians and others, and to my surprise they replied that they, too, thought it would be much more interesting to have a more lively record than just the printed text in translation. Viewing a debate on a monitor gives you the flavour of that debate. You can see the body language of the speakers, and you get much more than by just reading a dry text.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nonetheless, our report proposes a number of safeguards. Firstly, the plurilingual verbatim report that we already get the next day will continue. It will be there in all the original languages, as before. Secondly, any Member of this Parliament will have the guaranteed right to request a translation, if he or she needs it for his or her political work. The translation of any speech must be made rapidly available to the requesting Member. Thirdly, we provide that the Bureau may decide to ask for a written translation of a particularly important debate, which will then still be published in written form in every language. Fourthly, when extra language versions are available anyway, because they happen to have been translated – for instance, for a formal sitting at which a head of state is speaking, and courtesy translations have been provided – they too will be placed on Parliament’s website. Therefore, when translations are available in other languages, we will make use of them. Finally, we ask the Bureau to look at technological developments to see if, for instance, in the future, computer translations can provide an extra tool, giving at least a rough idea of what was said in debates.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, this is a fair proposal whose advantages outweigh the disadvantages. It is not just a matter of costs; it is also about being a modern parliament and making our debates accessible much more rapidly, in a form which is much more useful.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we have a free vote in our group, so I have no authority to speak for all my colleagues. We are again discussing the basic question whether a parliamentary service is worth the money or whether we must tighten our belt in response to the imperative of cutting costs. Let me say at the outset that I also regard the new concept of video presentation as a good idea which should not be jettisoned. Those people who want to have an immediate impression of our parliamentary proceedings can do so, and that is right and proper.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, however, that is not enough, because the archiving of written records is quite simply an essential service. Let me give you four reasons. Firstly, all of the world’s parliaments make their plenary debates available in written form and archive them so that people can consult the records to find out what has been discussed in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the video recording conveys a vivid and very interesting impression, but we also know that the hectic nature of proceedings often results in oral translations falling short of the quality we need.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know this internally from our dealings with the tabling office. We set up a tabling office ourselves to ensure that the formulation of motions and official documentation was absolutely correct. Because we operate so multilingually, we must exercise particular care. We want to continue taking the same care with our records of proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, the researchers who expressed their views on this subject may not have been fully aware of the implications, for although they might obtain a lively record, there is an underlying lack of rigour in the proposed approach. Besides, it is far easier to analyse a plenary debate if the researcher can enter a term, be it ‘pesticides’ or ‘CO2 ’, and be directed immediately to a debate on the matter in question. It would seem that this cannot be done with video recordings. In short, I believe that keeping written records represents value for money, and I am in favour of written archives in addition to video recordings.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that from a political viewpoint the subject we are debating today is about two objectives of equal importance, as the rapporteur, Mr Corbett, has said. On the one hand there are the technical issues: how we can better implement translation in technical terms and economise on resources? On the other, there is the issue of ensuring the greatest possible diversity of opinion, multilingualism and transparency in Parliament’s work. Here I have to say that in a political assembly such as ours, which is of course multi-ethnic and political, language is of very great importance. Language is not just a means of communication; it is, as it were, a vehicle of culture, an expression of ideas, and long may this be so. The technical issue must not be allowed to obscure the debate on equality and the coverage of all subjects by all the languages, and in full equality.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me point out that here we have another practical issue: how are we to achieve coverage in an economic way? Various problems arise. The first is the relegation of the written word, a matter already referred to as important. I think that in politics we ought to preserve the written word. The second problem to be taken into consideration is the lasting record of our Parliament’s business. Finally, if you will allow me to finish, Madam President: how can we make the work of our Parliament immediately available to the public, which I believe does not always have access to the internet?</p>

      <p sl="de">The printed word is the primary source and must be kept for reasons of consistency, transparency and simplicity of research at a time when we are seeking to promote the study of the European Parliament.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Commission’s initiative to amend Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament makes me think again about the European Union. Who is the Union for? Is it for ideologues or for the people? If it is supposed to help people, then why is something being proposed that is against their interest? What is it that we want to hide from people? Yes, hide. I say that because the intention to limit access to information in one’s own language will mean that. Why are citizen’s fundamental rights being breached and why are people being discriminated against on the basis of the date they acceded to the European Union or the number of people in their country? What is there in common between the principles of mutual respect and democracy and an attempt forcibly to bring about a situation where the inhabitants of the old EU Member States get materials, including written materials, in their own languages from the European Parliament, whilst the inhabitants of the new Member States are directed to websites to listen to recordings of debates. At the same time no attention is being paid to the fact that, in the new Member States, there are many people who cannot afford to have the internet at home. This affects millions of people; millions of people would be deprived of information. Justifying the proposed decision on grounds of costs sounds like a joke. Does this mean that we can afford to spend hundreds of millions of euros on unnecessary administration, on maintaining two or even three buildings for the Parliament, but we cannot afford to inform the people, the taxpayers, how the Union is spending their money and what are its plans.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, if we have any respect for ourselves and for other people, there can be only one solution, with no machinations. We fulfil the instructions in Rule 96, which states: ‘Parliament shall ensure the utmost transparency of its activities’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, time and again this Parliament has had to struggle with a very lax attitude to democracy on the part of the European Council. This can lead to the number of seats in Parliament being increased by one without consultation, whereupon they simply speak of 750 plus one and think this keeps them on the right side of the law. What fills me with apprehension, however, is the thought that this attitude is taking root in such a way here in Parliament that some Members are seeking to put the most trivial pragmatic considerations before the most basic of principles.</p>
      <p sl="de">It seems so simple at first sight. The Rules of Procedure commit us to the utmost transparency in our activities – not to any old interpretation of transparency, nor to a form of transparency tempered by pragmatism or cost-benefit calculations, but to the utmost transparency. The audiovisual presentation does not match that description. An audiovisual presentation can be used for propaganda purposes or provide a quick source of information, but it does not offer a serious analysis of the words spoken in this House, of the discussions and debates that take place here. Of that there can be no doubt.</p>
      <p sl="de">Multilingualism is a guiding principle of this Parliament, and parliamentary debates form the core of our activity. Being in touch with the people is our foremost duty. If we give this matter even a moment’s serious thought, we cannot deny that a parliament which sets itself apart from all other parliaments in the world by no longer archiving transcriptions of its debates is thereby sacrificing much of its parliamentary identity.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the cost factor, it would be very simple to cut costs by transcribing the interpretation of proceedings rather than translating them here. That would also reflect the liveliness of the debate and reproduce it in the way in which it was actually understood and conducted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this Parliament is like the Tower of Babel, an allegory of the Habsburg Empire, which was full of sycophants. It is the European Union’s attempt to build an international empire based on a unified creed, with federalists, liberals, cosmopolitans and sycophant humanist thinkers.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Tower was an idea of lunatics, however. Its ultimate failure is attributed to linguistic differences, or what is called ‘multilingualism’ in the European Union. The Corbett report seems to deny the nations of Europe to communicate effectively. Mr Corbett’s idea to draw up Europe as a multilingual document is like waiting for Godot, which is a communicative stagnation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report is a way to create a diversion from a real problem. To communicate and understand one another, we need a dialogue, not a monologue. The only instrument for this purpose is, therefore, translation into all 22 official languages. Otherwise we are heading towards communicative chaos.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, as the translation of my speeches into Polish sometimes does not even render 50% of what I have actually said, my Amendment 2 should therefore be included in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would urge all Members to vote for amendments that aim to preserve translation into all 22 languages and reject Mr Corbett’s Amendment 1, which has been tabled as the committee amendment on the voting list.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0343/2007) by Chris Davies, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (2007/2119(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-142" speaker_id="4554" name="Chris DAVIES" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="United Kingdom" birth_date="07-07-1954" birth_place="Lytham St Annes" p_group="Renew Europe Group" m_state="GB">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me start with an accusatory question to the Commissioner. Some of us have pointed out repeatedly over the years that the car makers were failing to comply with the terms of the voluntary agreement to reduce emissions. So, why is it that, some five years after this first became evident, we still do not have legislation before us requiring the manufacturers to meet the agreed targets, because with each month of delay it becomes harder to achieve the ambitions which were originally possible?</p>
      <p sl="en">This sets the framework for today’s debate. Average emissions from new cars stand now at a little less than 160 g of CO2 per kilometre – a long way adrift from the target of 140 g by 2008. Therefore, it is not surprising that Members here want car makers to be punished for breaking their commitment. Yet the fact is that the manufacturers have broken no laws and, however much we may wish it were otherwise, the level of emissions is where it is.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has announced that it wants to stick to the medium-term target setting that voluntary agreement of 120 g by 2012, but says that 10 g of this will now be achieved by complementary measures. I call this a political fudge: it has reduced the clarity of the target and encouraged some manufacturers to think that they can use biofuels as a means of avoiding significant design changes.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, given where we are, are the target and the timetable set by the Commission still appropriate, because, of late, the reduction in average emissions has been hardly more than 1 g a year? The Commission suggests that this should instantly be transformed into 5 g a year. Well, that can be achieved – and the technology exists to do it – but at what cost?</p>
      <p sl="en">Emission reductions must be made a priority for car makers, but they have to be achieved at the lowest possible expense. That means giving industry specific targets and sufficient time to make the changes. These improvements may increase the price of new cars but, then, reduced emissions mean improved fuel economy, so those who buy the cars will save money as they drive them. Get it right and we can take action which will be good for the environment, good for the consumer and good for the future of car making.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a debate in this Parliament about whether, in a pre-legislative report of this kind, environmentalists should be pressing to send a strong signal to the Commission to be tough, or whether we should try to be realistic in framing measures which might actually be those that end up close to the final form at the end of the day. That is why I am asking Parliament to break from the Commission position and recommend that the target for average emissions from new cars should be set not for 2012 but for 2015 and should be 125 g to be achieved by technical means alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">By all means let us encourage the use of complementary measures to reduce emissions, but as an addition, not as a substitute, for these technical improvements. For those Members who say this is not sufficient, let me just say that next month we will be voting on the CARS 21 report and, in that, the recommendation is 135 g by 2015. We can end up voting for one thing this month and something else next month. If I can help bring together the different positions of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, then I believe it will strengthen Parliament’s position and influence.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that manufacturers should be set absolutely clear targets with no room for wriggling. This report insists that failure to comply should result in the application of tough financial penalties. I propose an internal trading mechanism to give manufacturers maximum flexibility and give incentives to the makers of low-emission vehicles. But, ultimately, it is the penalty regime that matters and that, I suspect, will test the Commission’s resolve.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally important is the need to set long-term targets to reduce emissions to below 100 g by 2020. Given sufficient time, and an absolute requirement, I have no doubt that manufactures can achieve reductions of nearly 40% over the next 13 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me just touch upon the way in which cars are promoted. The manufacturers always claim that they respond to consumer demand, but I do not believe this. I believe they shape consumer demand. Studies have shown that a very high proportion of advertising expenditure goes towards the promotion of cars on the basis of power and size and speed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The car industry is supposed to be drawing up a voluntary code of advertising conduct but we have had our fingers burnt through voluntary codes and any such measure should be regarded with suspicion. It is time that advertisements give consumers more details of the fuel economy and emission performance of the vehicles on sale. This information should be upfront and not buried away in the small print. We need to encourage car makers to compete on the basis that their cars are safe and stylish and environmentally-friendly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish with these remarks. Europe’s car makers produce fine vehicles. The technical expertise of the companies themselves is much to be admired, but for too long they have ignored the contribution their products are making to the threat posed by climate change. For the sake of the planet, for the good of an industry that needs to stay at the cutting edge of world-class technology, it is time now for law-makers to steer them firmly in a greener direction.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, road transport, along with the other sectors of the economy, must contribute to efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in a bid to achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets and our future commitments for 2020 and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="el">Road transport is the second highest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12% of the EU’s total emissions. It is worth noting that while total emissions in the EU of the 27 Member States fell by nearly 8% in the period between 1990 and 2005, emissions from road transport increased over the same time period by 25%. Here I should remind you that from 1995 the Commission set the target of 120 grammes, and the car industry was aware of it. Let me also remind you that there was a voluntary agreement on achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions to 140 gr per km by 2008. The Commission realised that this target would not be met by the car industry and the industry itself admitted this. As a natural consequence, the European Commission carried out a re-examination last February of the Community strategy for the reduction of CO2 emissions by new cars, with mandatory legislation based on an integrated approach through which the European aim of reducing emissions by new cars to 120 gr. by 2012 would be met.</p>
      <p sl="el">Dealing with the problem of CO2 emissions from cars is also expected to contribute to the hoped-for reinforced EU energy protection, by reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels. This, of course, will lead to a reduction in consumer expenditure on fuel.</p>
      <p sl="el">Madam President, I am pleased to note that your report approves of our initiative in putting forward a legislative framework to reduce CO2 emissions by cars, and I thank the rapporteur, Mr Davies, for his efforts, as well as Mrs Harms and Mr Bulfon from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection respectively, for their suggestions on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report sets out ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 and stresses that greater and more long-term progress will be needed. The challenge is now to transform this political support into practical action.</p>
      <p sl="el">The draft report proposes various important areas of work are, two of which I should like to comment on.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, your report points to the legitimate need of the car industry to have a time limit to be able to adjust smoothly to the new legislative arrangements. Of course, as I have said before, this reduction strategy dates back to 1995. Last month at the Frankfurt Motor Show, it was clear that the European car industry had made a significant response to the challenge of our new proposal. Within a short period of time car manufacturers have managed to put forward economically affordable technical solutions, which are significantly fuel-efficient. I am absolutely convinced that with our revised strategy and the imminent legislative framework we will offer car manufacturers equal terms of competition. Environmental performance will be the motivation, not competition based merely on car size or engine capacity. We can already see the first results. Now that petrol prices are reaching record highs, we must waste no opportunity in setting ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the European car industry. That will act as a strong incentive for innovation and renewal; it will also allow for major exports to emerging countries, where there is a great demand for fuel-efficient cars.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, your report points to the need for certain important parameters to take into account in future legislation, such as those determined by social impact and affordable prices for consumers. Of course, fair treatment for all sides is very important. I want to stress that we firmly intend to propose legislation to assess the situation of all car manufacturers and avoid any unjustifiable distortion of competition. The overall target will be apportioned between car manufacturers in a sustainable and socially just manner. The integrated approach that we are proposing will help the sector to prepare for the challenges ahead and will avoid an unfair burden on specific enterprises or on the sector as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="el">These preliminary comments conclude what I have to say. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, may I say to Mr Davies that we should recall clearly why we have to discuss stringent binding emission limits. The reason is that, following a voluntary agreement concluded between the Commission and the car industry more than ten years ago, the latter has knowingly and wilfully failed to meet its targets. The present situation, as we know, is not down to bad luck or an unforeseeable turn of events but to decisions taken by the senior management of manufacturing groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, Mr Davies, I am somewhat stunned at the clear message you have now sent through your amendments – which I saw for the first time today, although they may have existed for longer – that, in spite of what was decided in the Environment Committee, you no longer have any interest in exerting pressure on the innovative potential and innovative power of the car industry in Europe</p>
      <p sl="de">My opinion is that we can only achieve Europe’s climate targets through the strict limits that were originally proposed by the Commission. It is also my opinion – and you rightly addressed this point, Mr Dimas – that we shall not be able to obtain security of energy supply for our transport needs unless we ensure without delay that cars become more efficient, because we cannot stand by and watch as oil that is valuable and hard to come by continues to be squandered on our roads.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point, to which the Committee on Industry, whose opinion I drafted, attaches such great importance is the need to ensure at long last that the knowledge and ability of engineers and developers in the car industry are brought into play, and that these good engineers are not further stifled by misguided management policies. I am firmly convinced that nothing but efficient, climate-friendly and affordable but stylish cars would be on the market within a very short time and that those who are easing the pressure for innovation today by setting what are truly very soft time limits for achieving reduction targets, Mr Davies, will bear responsibility if the European car industry proves uncompetitive in the long run and if jobs are lost in car manufacturing in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">It goes without saying that the global car market will change out of all recognition – assuming we accept the underlying premises of our climate policy and our UN climate policy – and that those who are now applying the brakes to the process of reducing emission limits will then bear responsibility for the car industry in Europe going to the dogs and for a situation in which we ourselves no longer take our own climate policy seriously.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I acknowledge the car as a universal means of transport, and I acknowledge the contribution of the car industry to the prosperity of Europeans. I do not, however, believe in the car as a fetish. For that reason it is incomprehensible to me that manufacturers should design cars to travel at speeds in excess of 125 miles per hour.</p>
      <p sl="de">Building efficient, environment-friendly cars is a necessity, given all the evidence of climate change. In addition, Europe is duty-bound to set a good example to the booming emerging markets. It is ultimately the consumer’s choice that will determine which cars are driven in the years to come. This is why I argued in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for transparent and more easily understandable information on the emission ratings of vehicles. I call on the Commission to take this report as the starting point for the presentation of an ambitious legislative proposal and to act quickly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, can I first of all thank Mr Davies very much indeed for all the work that he has put into this report, and for his extremely constructive cooperation. I am happy, on behalf of my Group, to endorse the target of 125 g by 2015 that Mr Davies has outlined. It is a target which, I think, is extremely environmentally ambitious, but it is also achievable by what is a very successful European industry employing hundreds of thousands of people, and we must ensure that it remains a successful European industry. I am convinced that those European car manufacturers will continue to produce some of the most environmentally friendly cars in the world, and these new targets – which, we should never forget, are the tightest in the world – will help them to achieve even cleaner cars in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">But the missing link in this debate is, of course, that of consumer demand. We must make sure that consumers are demanding cleaner, more environmentally friendly cars, and, there, the Member States themselves have a very important role to play through their tax systems, which is, rightly, a matter for them. They can, however, considerably affect consumer demand by introducing the correct environmentally friendly taxation schemes.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also, in my view, need contributions to CO2 reduction from all of the related sectors: from the oil companies, from the biofuel producers, from the tyre manufacturers etc., all of whom have a contribution to make and can help us to achieve our ambitious targets.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have also tabled some amendments to water down what I think are some very prescriptive requirements on advertisers, which Mr Davies has included in his report. I think they are grossly disproportionate to the problem, and I am sure that, given sufficient opportunity, the manufacturers and the advertisers can come up with a binding voluntary code which would be equally effective.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have also tabled – jointly with Mr Davies – an amendment to recognise the contribution of small-volume manufacturers who do not have a huge product range with which to average out the emissions requirements. I hope the Commission will take those into account when formulating the legislation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, Commissioner, this is a matter of urgency, as we all know. Al Gore, who rang the alarm bell, has been awarded the Nobel Prize, and it is time for the European Union to stop talking and to act, because this is not a new issue. There was a voluntary agreement entered into by car manufacturers to achieve average emissions of 140g of CO2 per kilometre by 2008, and that agreement was not kept. I would remind you that the European Parliament itself fixed the target of 120g by 2005 or 2010 at the latest. There is no justification today for backing away from those targets. So what we need is an ambitious, unambiguous and binding directive and it needs to set targets in two stages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, in the short term, we need a target of 120g of CO2 for new cars and a 10g reduction to be achieved through complementary measures. We need to move swiftly, however, and we therefore support the vote in the Committee on the Environment for the target to be achieved in 2012, with binding steps from 2009 onwards so that by 2012 the target will be met in full for all vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the second stage, we believe it is essential to set targets of 95g for 2020 and 70g for 2025, with an intermediary deadline in 2016 to ensure that we are on track. We therefore support the ambitious roadmap prepared by the Committee on the Environment because we think it succeeds in setting clearly visible standards, while at the same time confronting us with the technology gap that we need to overcome in order to meet our Kyoto Protocol commitments. Yes, of course, it is going to be expensive and there will have to be negotiation about the price of new vehicles. The first thing to note is that not all cars and not all manufacturers achieved the same effectiveness under the voluntary agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, we do need to favour small cars over large cars and we need to come up with tax measures, new practices and even bans in some cases, particularly in built-up areas, to prevent large vehicles, including 4x4s, from polluting our towns and cities all day long and producing huge quantities of CO2 . This question is particularly important because the bigger the vehicles that manufacturers produce, the bigger their profit margins. We therefore need to guide the market in such a way that manufacturers producing smaller, less polluting vehicles can be more profitable than those producing big high-polluting cars and, as well as setting standards, we expect the Commission to propose strategies for moving in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The last point I should like to stress is the importance of proper information for vehicle purchasers to help them pick their way through this minefield, and specifically we need to get rid of misleading advertising. That is why my group has tabled an amendment requiring a labelling system for all cars, based on an A-G format for energy efficiency, so that all consumers can make an active choice in favour of the environment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, when it comes to discussing CO2 emissions, we are very quick to talk about cars, simply because the way to a person’s guilty conscience is through their car. That is why Mrs Harms, the Greens and many environmental organisations are particularly keen to talk about cars.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are faced with a broken voluntary pledge – no doubt about that – and we therefore need regulation. We have no alternative. What you came here and told us, Mrs Harms, about the voluntary commitment being deliberately and strategically torpedoed by the car industry seems rather far-fetched to me. Let me just remind you that a market comprises not only suppliers of products but also those who demand them. We ourselves help to create demand too, and shortly, when we are driven home by the car service, we shall be using those very cars that do not meet the targets to which the car makers committed themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to see an initiative from the Greens. If your intentions are honourable, please now make sure that the small cars which meet next year’s voluntary target are ordered for Parliament. In future legislation, it is imperative for us to ensure that the desired reductions stand up to cost-benefit analysis. The Stern report which you and the Greens like to quote, Mrs Harms, calculates that, of 13 potential CO2 -reduction measures, those targeting cars at the very top of the price range are actually the least effective. Anyone making political demands for stringent emission limits and more efficient cars must recognise that the development and production cycle in the car industry takes five to seven years. It is by failing to recognise that, Mrs Harms, that we put jobs at risk, not by recognising it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am therefore pleased that our rapporteur has done just this by saying that it is unrealistic to set any deadline before 2015. Tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of one of the options on the table, and it must be said that, whatever it is, whatever year is designated and whatever average value is set, it will still be more stringent and ambitious than any other regime in the world. We should not lose sight of that. There is an extremely fine line between carrot and stick for our car industry, and at the end of the day we must take great care to ensure that we really do export the best products and not perhaps our industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think this is the right moment to inform the outside world about what this Callanan-Davies deal is. So, what is it? It is delaying action from 2012 to 2015. We have calculated the CO2 impact: 125 g in 2015 is worse than 130 g in 2012. And the second part of the deal is exemptions for small-volume producers. That is 300 000 cars a year, so that is not ‘small volumes’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that what we are voting on this week, Mr Davies’ initiatives, are from a Green Liberal climate hero who has become a climate Judas. It is really incredible: instead of using the possible centre-left majority in this House for 120 g in 2012, siding with reactionary Tories to help the car industry in Europe to win time – that is really not the way forward.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in the past few months my fellow Members and I have met a great many representatives of the motor industry. I do not think there has ever been so much lobbying over a report. The industry has used every possible argument to prevent measures limiting CO2 emissions or at any rate to delay them. It seems that they have won over many of my fellow Members, including the rapporteur, although fortunately the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was fully aware of its task.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let me be clear: the motor industry is entirely responsible for this Commission proposal. Attempts to agree on voluntary regulation were a miserable failure. It seems that only compulsory standards are effective. I find complaints that it all has to be done so quickly quite hypocritical, because the industry has known for years that these measures had to come. The environment has to be cared for now, with drastic measures. We have to do that, for ourselves and for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am therefore urging a vote against Amendment 42, tabled by Mr Callanan and Mr Davies. The amendment increases the maximum amount of CO2 and postpones the agreed date of 2012 to 2015. That gives commercial interests priority over the environment and we absolutely cannot allow that. What is Mr Davies trying to do to us?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to thank Mr Davies for the way he has approached this, particularly his willingness to listen, and for a number of innovative approaches that we see in his report. I also want to thank our rapporteur, Mr Bulfon, and to thank Mr Davies for adopting a number of our proposals in his report.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have heard a lot of debate and discussion this evening about the car industry missing targets and about how we are going to move forward. But I would like to echo what the Commissioner said and use the word ‘incentive’. This programme, and to meet the programme that Mr Davies has set out, is going to need billions and billions of euros of investment in new products and is going to tie up immense resources in engineering and product development.</p>
      <a text="(Objections)"/>
      <p sl="en">I see my Green colleagues already shaking their heads; they seem to think that the technology is there, that overnight we can change a fundamental industry in that direction. This is entirely unrealistic – where is the investment going to come from? It is going to come from the profits of the car companies. We need to sustain those profits so that they can reinvest them. This demand here will be the biggest change and turnaround we have ever seen in a major industry. Let us just remember that. Let us not just sit here and make unrealistic demands. This is a practical approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, colleagues, let me remind you – and I refuse to accept this sort of crowing – I am absolutely not a lobbyist for the car industry. I have argued for a long time that we need to set demanding targets. We are moving towards a legislative approach for the first time. But you should be listening as well. And let me just make this other point. Ideas about complementary measures and other things: what we are talking about here is a complete change in the way that people approach transport and motoring. These new vehicles will come on the market over a long period of time. But actually the complementary measures we are talking about – the consumer measures, the consumer information – those are the real incentives that we need to bring in. I am sorry to overrun, Madam President, but you will admit I was interrupted by some colleagues in an entirely unnecessary way.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, this report, which Chris Davies has drawn up on the initiative of the Environment Committee, should signal to the Commission that the European Parliament is serious about reducing CO2 emissions. When I see the amendments on the table, I start to wonder about that.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are three points we should bear in mind. Firstly, from 1 January 2012, new cars in Europe must not emit more than 120g of CO2 per kilometre. We should not tamper with that date or the emission limit. In 1998 the car industry made a voluntary commitment to reduce CO2 -emission levels in its new vehicles. In the light of news reports about the continuing advance of climate change, I see no reason at all for us to interfere with the deadline or the ceiling.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, future legislation must spell out clearly that the CO2 emissions of all cars must be reduced. Large cars must make a greater contribution, but smaller cars must contribute too, so that we can achieve 120 grams by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is that cars must remain affordable for people. I agree with the previous speaker on that. I come from a predominantly rural area, where people are dependent on cars to get them to their places of work. For this reason, future legislation must perform a balancing act to reconcile the needs of the environment with those of the economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">What good are strict emission limits if people can no longer afford new cars and drive about in their ageing vehicles? It takes more than eight and a half years to renew the entire fleet of passenger cars on Europe’s roads, and this must be in the back of our minds when we adopt new legislation. Future legislation on CO2 emissions from passenger cars should be guided by the need to guarantee better protection of the climate as well as affordable driving.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, I could begin like one of those old jokes: I have some good news and some bad news; which do you want to hear first?</p>
      <p sl="hu">I will start with the good news: the European Union is leading the battle to combat climate change; the 27 EU countries are now doing more than anywhere else in the world to halt climate change. Now for the bad news: if the thousands of scientists around the world are right, then even this is much too little. What then are we to do?</p>
      <p sl="hu">The answer leaves no room for doubt: we need a paradigm shift. It is to be commended that Mr Davies’ report highlights a number of important elements. However, anyone who thinks that we will have solved anything by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the ever-increasing number of vehicles we use to 120g or 95g is gravely mistaken.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In my opinion, we can and must vote in favour of this report, and at the same time we must compel vehicle manufacturers to produce smaller and more efficient engines. We must not stop there, however. The European Union must commit itself unequivocally to technological change in the transport sector too. Every means available must be used to promote research and development and innovation in this field, and we must stop providing any kind of support for conventional technologies.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Member States must borrow the best solutions from each other as soon as possible to provide manufacturers and consumers with legal, economic and other incentives. Furthermore, while we are on the subject, I do not believe, for example, that biofuels are going provide the ultimate solution to our problems, especially not the current, first-generation biofuels. They do seem, however, to be a necessary step on the way towards alternative fuels, as are hydrogen and electric propulsion systems and many other systems that are not yet widely used or have yet to be devised. Let us help to foster these with the present vote and future legislation. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will not comment on this new cosying up between the British Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, as has been displayed by Mr Callanan and Mr Davies here tonight. Maybe it is the new leadership battle for the Lib-Dems that has been going on, since some of their new leaders even have lookalikes!</p>
      <p sl="en">What I want to talk about is the importance of sticking with ambitious targets. I do not think industry can have been very surprised that the Commission talked about 2012 as a date for the targets or about the level of the target, because, of course, we know these have been mooted for many years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Back in March, the EU leaders signed up to cut overall CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020. If we are going to get there, we need to bring forward legislation which helps us to get there. So, here we are at the very first hurdle towards that, and I do not think it is time now to fail in this European Parliament. People out there are watching. They want to know we are serious about tackling climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we have to work with industry, and Mr Davies talks about punishing industry. Nobody wants to punish industry because the car industry, as Mr Harbour has just said, is a major European industry; it is a major employer and we have to work with them because only they can deliver these changes that we need to see.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we need to work with them and we need to listen and I think what we need beyond everything else is a long-term project which everybody has signed up to so that everybody knows where we are going and everybody can try to get there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on labelling and advertising. We need a clear system, a green car labelling system, that every consumer can understand, just as they understand, when they buy white goods, how those white goods work. The white goods manufacturers of inefficient goods have actually seen their products fall off the market. We need to see the same for cars and I hope we can work together with industry to get a green labelling system that everybody understands.</p>

      <p sl="et">So far our climate policy has focused principally on the energy sector. Aviation is the next sector which will be incorporated into the European Union’s emissions trading system. Land transport, however, has a major influence on climate change and the Davies report is a thoroughly welcome initiative. The car industry needs clear, long-term targets for reducing the level of CO2 emissions in exhaust gases and I support Mr Davies’ approach whereby long-term limits will be established for CO2 emissions, for example for 2020 or 2025.</p>
      <p sl="et">The car industry has had plenty of time to reduce the level of CO2 emissions. We should not accept continued procrastination: the technological solutions already exist. Similarly, I hope that Parliament will support the amendment I tabled to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Security, under which the car industry would have to reduce CO2 in exhaust emissions to 120g/km by 2012.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report. When discussing the whole issue of the Community’s strategy to reduce CO2 emissions, it should be remembered that, in Europe alone, two million people are employed in the automotive industry, and another 10 million jobs are linked to this sector. This industry represents 3.5% of European GDP. The export value is EUR 33.5 billion and, what is no less significant, each year motor taxes generate EUR 365 billion for Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Community’s strategy to reduce CO2 emissions will be successful only if it is thought through properly and provides sufficient time for producers to develop appropriate technological solutions. I am in favour of introducing an appropriate transition period because the production cycle in the automotive industry is complex and needs a long time to adapt. It would seem therefore that the best date for the introduction of the regulations would be 2015, also because the Euro 6 Regulation will come into force in that year. I also think that there should be an integrated approach to CO2 emissions. Research studies have indicated that to achieve the objective of 120g/km just through improvements in automotive technology will result in an increase of around EUR 3 600 in the average price of a car, which may result in many brands of cars becoming less accessible to the average EU citizen.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason, basing CO2 emissions exclusively on engine technology is the most expensive solution. One could achieve the 120g level by introducing additional solutions, such as introducing biofuels to a greater degree than at present, as well as by introducing additional solutions in vehicles, such as signals to change gears or low resistance tyres.</p>

If we want to tackle climate change, we cannot ignore the motor sector. Unless action is taken, emissions will increase, not fall.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately the motor industry has failed to take the initiative. Years ago, motor manufacturers themselves made a commitment to reduce emissions. The industry has built better and safer cars in the past few years. A great deal of progress has been made, but unfortunately engine efficiency has been sadly neglected.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The target of 140g in 2008 will therefore not be achieved, certainly not on a voluntary basis. Legislation is unfortunately not enough to achieve efficiency. Legislation must be aimed at achieving an average emission of 120g in 2012, not in 2015. A long-term target of 80g per kilometre is needed because we have set an ambitious goal for 2020 and that must also be reflected in the motor industry.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, private cars are responsible for 12% of all CO2 emissions. We all know that. It is clear that that sector has to make a major effort to achieve the agreed standards for 2020. It is also clear that we have to be ambitious and set the bar high.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is clear, too, that car manufacturers will not be able to do that alone. An integrated approach is needed; they should not have to take sole responsibility. Flanking measures therefore have to be taken. Better air conditioning, better roads and a change in driver behaviour – in other words, all of us. The sector deserves support from the government because the motor industry employs a large number of people, directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, I am therefore appealing to national governments to modify their motor taxes as a matter of urgency, so that consumers switch to environmentally friendly cars of their own accord. Secondly, I appeal to the Commissioner, the Commission and Europe to conduct an assessment of the 2009 multiannual budget in order to invest even more research funding in new research technologies for low CO2 cars. I know you recently announced an ambitious programme to invest EUR 500 million in hydrogen technology. Of course that is fantastic, but it is medium-term. Obviously solutions have to be found for the new engine technology in the short term as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am sure that, whether it is by 2012 or a little later, smart car manufacturers will reach the goal of 120g much more quickly than planned. Simply because – and I do not want to be naïve – the market demands it. In that sense the context has changed completely in the past couple of years. It is therefore important that we approve the compromise proposals by Mr Callanan on marketing and advertising, because they are transparent. It is a question of giving consumers clear information.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for the quality of this evening’s debate. I would like to comment, time permitting, on three of the issues you have addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the ambitious level of the strategy, the Commission has proposed its strategy on the basis of a thorough impact assessment. We have analysed the various options of a level to reduce CO2 emissions from cars, taking into account measurability, monitorability and accountability.</p>
      <p sl="en">On this basis we have proposed to deliver the 120 g of CO2 per kilometre objective through an integrated approach. One hundred and thirty grams will be delivered through passenger car technology and ten additional grams will be provided through complementary measures, including fuel efficiency targets for light commercial vehicles and an increased use of biofuels.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach towards achieving the 120 g target is, in our view, the most cost-effective combination of options, and we will thus propose legislation accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the legislative framework implementing the integrated approach will be the central pillar of our revised strategy, but it is not the only one. As underlined in your report, finding ways to encourage consumer demand for fuel-efficient cars will enable us significantly to reduce their environmental impact, along with the fuel bill of drivers in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of the review in the Car Labelling Directive, we will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament in the field of consumer information.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the Commission agrees that a longer-term strategy should be considered, in order to provide predictability to car makers. We will thus consider the potential for progress beyond 2012, and the 120 g objective, on the basis of an impact assessment. In this context, the Commission will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament concerning future emission targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe I have addressed some of the main concerns that have been voiced, and I hope that Plenary will adopt a resolution which strongly supports the approach proposed by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since I have a few extra minutes, let me begin by thanking the Commission, the Secretariat of our Committee and the other rapporteurs. It was not such an easy task, and I am grateful that we managed to cooperate in an objective manner and to seek out the widest possible common ground on what is not an entirely straightforward issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our work was based on three communications from the Commission, and our aim in this report was to provide answers in the three areas covered by those communications, which we managed to do by a large majority in the responsible committee. The starting point was a generally accepted principle that is restated in every debate on energy policy, namely the view shared by the Commission and Parliament that energy policy has three major goals – competitiveness, in other words affordable prices, protection of the environment and security of supply. The conclusion that the solution lay in the continuing development of new and existing energy technology was certainly the easiest part of the report to deal with.</p>
      <p sl="de">Technology is the key to the pursuit of these three goals. In a world in which demand for energy is constantly growing while the supply of fossil fuels is steadily dwindling, it is therefore crucial that we invest in research and innovation and try to make progress in these areas. We need only look at the potential for increasing the generation efficiency of coal-fired power stations, which averages 34% at the present time but could be raised to 55% through the use of state-of-the-art technology. If a third of old plants were replaced by cutting-edge facilities, fuel consumption could be reduced by 30%. That is just a small example of the opportunities offered by new technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also spoke about two energy sources which are very different from each other but which share the distinction of provoking the greatest political controversy. No one doubts that the share of fossil fuels, which accounted for 79% of gross domestic fuel consumption in the European Union in 2004, will remain high in the foreseeable future. However long this may continue, the fact is that we will certainly have to operate with fossil fuels for some time to come. Coal is a major factor that plays an important role – one reason, of course, being that it is one of the few energy sources, or indeed the main energy source, that we possess in Europe, even if its availability varies between Member States. This is a significant advantage, particularly in terms of the security of our energy supplies.</p>
      <p sl="de">This means – and this was an important point in our discussions – that when we say coal has a future, which the Commission has thankfully described, we must ensure that the critical aspects of coal use are addressed. One of these critical aspects is the emission of carbon dioxide. One option is greater efficiency and better technology, and the other option is to try to use new technology to separate CO2 and store it underground – the famous carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is easier said than done of course, but there are indications that it works. We have acknowledged that in this report and have advocated promoting the development of CCS technology, because it gives us a chance to go on benefiting from coal, which is a very reliable source of energy for us in Europe. This is why we have also stressed that we need to tread warily, that carbon capture can reduce generation efficiency and that it is therefore difficult to estimate when CCS technology could come on stream. Above all, we must do our homework and formulate the appropriate legal provisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third and most controversial part of the report relates to the issue of nuclear energy. Nuclear plants account for more than 30% of power generation in Europe, and nuclear power has advantages that are undeniable, whatever our political views. It is there, it is affordable, and it makes a major contribution to security of supply. In terms of reducing CO2 emissions, it is an extremely exciting and interesting option, and I do believe it would be reckless if we simply pushed this form of energy aside and did not even consider it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We succeeded – not without difficulty – in finding formulas to which a large majority could subscribe and which conveyed the message that airing these ideas is part and parcel of a full debate but that the decision to adopt or reject them is a matter for the Member States. That is quite an important point, but our intention is to contribute to the area for which Europe bears some responsibility, namely security of supply. In this respect it is a wise move to establish the High-Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management and the European Nuclear Energy Forum, and it is undoubtedly right, as postulated in the Illustrative Nuclear Programme for the Community (the PINC paper), to carry this debate forward and, when we discuss investments in new technology, not to turn our backs on any potential solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">In short, an energy mix does not mean sifting out particular sources of energy but taking all sources into consideration. I hope we shall manage to adopt this resolution tomorrow in the form in which it was approved by a large majority in committee.</p>

    <intervention id="1-165" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Reul on his report. It comes as the last report from the European Parliament in the follow-up of the energy and climate change package from 10 January. The other two reports, by Mr Vidal-Quadras and Ms Thomsen, have given the Commission valuable input for further formulation of the proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first concerns our preparation of the internal market package, and the second, the continuing work on the Directive on Renewable Energy. I am also very grateful for the timely input Mr Reul and this House will provide in the area of energy innovation, clean fossil fuel and nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">On many accounts, the Commission is already in line with the calls of Parliament and is working on a number of outstanding issues identified in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe needs to achieve the important goal of combating climate change. For that, and also for security of supply, we need low-carbon, highly efficient energy technologies. We also need to use fossil fuels in a more sustainable way. And it will be difficult to achieve our climate change goals without the use of nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by addressing the issue of energy innovation. The Commission intends to present the European Strategic Technology Plan at the end of November. Europe has proven to be successful in setting a regulatory framework in support of low-carbon technologies. Targets have been agreed for energy savings and for renewable energy. We are also building a truly internal market. There is no doubt that these are the basis for the third Industrial Revolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this is far from enough. If we only depend upon imported low-carbon technologies, we will fail our security of supply and competitiveness objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The analyses currently under way in the Commission show that Europe is falling short in the development of low-carbon technologies. In essence, we are not able to convert the high quality, basic research that is done in the EU into world leading technologies. Today, we do not focus sufficiently on matching research to business developments, by building pilot and demonstration plants to get up to full commercial scale.</p>
      <p sl="en">For Europe to lead the world in innovation for climate change and energy security, it is essential to be more efficient in the management of the resources invested in energy innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore need better, joint strategic planning at EU level, as well as more effective implementation of energy technology programmes and measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, and as was stated in Mr Reul’s report, we have to mobilise additional financial and human resources for energy technology research and demonstration.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already increased the budget for energy in the seventh Framework Programme by 50% and for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme by 100%. This could not have been achieved without strong support from the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States are also going down this road, and I am convinced that the private sector will do the same, once the framework conditions are right. This applies in particular to industrial-scale demonstration projects and early market deployment, as well as to the fundamental role of small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will now turn to the second part of the report: the challenges associated with conventional sources of energy. We must recognise that these energy sources will play a substantial role in the energy mix for years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">We share the same view: that we need to make the transition from traditional to sustainable fossil fuels. Before the end of the year, the Commission will take further steps to address the use of modern technologies in power generation from fossil fuels.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, the Commission will address the issue of the legal framework for the capture of carbon dioxide and its geological storage. We will table a legislative proposal which aims at establishing the regulatory framework in order to provide legal certainty, and to ensure public confidence in the safety of carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment. I am also currently preparing a communication to set the political framework in support of CCS.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree that CCS will require significant research efforts before it can be commercially viable. This is why CCS will be included among the strategic energy technologies in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. This is also why we are singling it out for communication in connection with the legislative proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel with continuous research and development efforts, the EU needs to move on demonstration plants. Such projects will provide invaluable experience. They will allow us to optimise existing technologies, and to identify and respond to the remaining challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">The goal is clear: to see several large-scale demonstration plants operational in the EU by 2015, and to bring the technology to the market by 2020. This will not happen unless there is strong commitment from the European private sector and strong, supportive government policies. The Commission is ready to lead, but it will be necessary to get the full support of Member States and of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will now come to nuclear energy. I am pleased to note that your message regarding nuclear energy is fully in line with our conclusions in the communication on a Nuclear Illustrative Programme, as widely supported by the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also glad that the first meeting of the High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management took place on 12 October. The group has a mandate to progressively develop common understanding and, eventually, a higher level of nuclear safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">I share the report’s view that an open dialogue on nuclear energy is essential. For this reason, the Commission has set up a nuclear forum, on the lines of the other energy forums. The aim of the Nuclear Forum is to enlarge the debate on nuclear energy, and to involve all the relevant players.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 26-27 November, the first meeting of that forum, also called the Bratislava/Prague Forum, will take place. I trust it will mean more transparency in allowing for consultation with, and between, all stakeholders. I am pleased that the European Parliament will also participate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like, once again, to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent report. I thank the European Parliament for its support and cooperation. We will use this report in our further work, and I definitely look forward to the debate.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, excuse me, but this report is not good, and neither has the work process in connection with it been good. Why has the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy not listened to the statements from other committees? On behalf of the Committee on Development I regret the fact that we have only been asked for a statement on the Commission’s carbon emissions. Energy efficiency and savings and our most important criticisms are far too weak. In addition, they are otherwise entirely decisive for the developing nations. There is a huge amount of energy to be obtained through savings, and there are known technologies available, and for the developing nations at least it is much, much more important than CSS. In general, this also applies to the industrialised nations. In addition, why is oil being forgotten completely? The high oil prices are a major burden for the developing nations, particularly within the transport sector, where oil is dominant. In addition to improving efficiency, there is a need for other transport models. However, renewable energy is crucial if the developing nations are to develop, and it is grotesque that this is barely mentioned in the report. The proposal is blunt, and the views of the Committee on Development are not included in any way. I would therefore like to urge everyone to address this tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would agree with the opinion of Herbert Reul as regards diversification in electricity generation, diversification of supply and improvements in energy efficiency and usage. The fact that natural resources are continually dwindling is nothing new to scientists working in the area of energy supply. For years, leading research centres have been observing the level of usage of natural resources and have published alarming reports. The findings of these reports show unequivocally that continued reliance solely on conventional methods of generating energy could, in future, lead the global economy to an energy crisis. Dwindling natural resources means that Europe will increasingly have to import from neighbouring countries, which can result in a gradual dependence on suppliers. We have already seen the negative consequences of such a policy on a number of occasions in neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason one of the principal challenges facing the European Union is diversification of energy sources as well as to work on creating new energy generation technologies. Positive policies in this area will be beneficial not just to society and the economy, but also to the natural environment. At this point, however, I would like to emphasise that not all countries will be able to pursue this policy in the short term. This is linked to historical conditions that resulted in the power sector, for many years, being backward in comparison with the countries of the old EU. For this reason, from the perspective of a citizen of such a country, I would like to point out that, as I said, Poland or the other countries in this geographical area will have to cover more ground than the countries of western Europe in modernising the power sector. Please consider this particular point. Taking climate change into account, the EU should become more involved in work on clean coal technology as the optimal solution for the natural environment, especially in those countries where the power sector in largely dependent on the use of coal.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us makes no secret of the fact that there are major arguments against conventional forms of energy. The issue most talked about nowadays in this connection is that of climate change. Not only do fossil energy sources contribute to global climate change, however; they also make Europe more dependent on external suppliers.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me to cite one example from Hungary to illustrate my point. In a country where raw materials are in short supply, gas comprises 50% of the energy mix, 80% of this deriving from a single external source, namely Russia. This results in a degree of dependency that not only has far-reaching social and economic consequences, but can also exert considerable influence on Hungary’s international relations. At the same time, however, these figures and others like them show that conventional energy sources are inevitably going to play a major role in Europe’s energy supply in the decades ahead, even if renewable energies gain ground. To state the contrary would be tantamount to sticking our heads in the sand.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the contradiction between the necessity of conventional sources and the risks associated with them must, however, be resolved. I believe Mr Reul’s report presents the necessary toolkit for doing just this. I agree with the rapporteur that the European Union needs to focus on three fundamental objectives when establishing policy on conventional energy sources: increasing efficiency, and, connected to this, exploiting the potential of research and development, and reducing dependency on external sources. The best example of this last point is the Nabucco project; construction of this gas pipeline would represent a significant step towards diversification and so it is in the Community’s interests to make it happen. Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, energy is a crucial factor as regards market competitiveness as well as quality of life for EU inhabitants. For this reason, therefore, the fundamental political and economic goals must be effectiveness in the sustainable generation of energy, efficiency in terms of reductions in overall usage, as well as reliability and safety of energy supplies. Achieving these goals will also result in a safe society. We cannot forget how much our citizens pay, either directly or indirectly, for every unit of energy. The competitiveness of the EU Member State’s economies depends, among other factors, on better use of regional resources in the form of fossil fuels. This will only happen, however, when the Commission provides guarantees that the emission trading system will not hamper the replacement of existing power stations, e.g. coal-fired power stations, by more modern systems with lower CO2 emissions. Poland has already reduced emissions by 32% since 1988 while, over the same period, the countries of the old EU have done considerably less. The present figure for emissions per inhabitant in Poland stands at 7 tonnes per annum, while in the old EU countries this is up to two times higher. In these circumstances it would not be right for Poland to reduce CO2 emissions drastically by a further 30% from next year. This is a Commission decision that would have highly unfavourable social consequences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My country cannot be sacrificed to the politics of climate hysteria. It is well known that the climate has changed, is changing and will continue to change and that we have to counteract the consequences of these changes, i.e. droughts, floods and shortages of drinking water. Justice, however, demands that reductions in CO2 emissions be linked to a per capita figure in EU countries. It is important that emission costs should not be decided arbitrarily on the basis of reductions and unclear principles. Competitiveness cannot be a function of false market incentives, and the price of energy has to reflect its real cost. It would seem sensible to use all possible methods that have been tested to absorb carbon dioxide, including biological methods, and to absorb methane. At present, however, priority should definitely be given to methods that improve the efficiency of converting primary energy into other forms based on pilot technological installations for the gasification and liquefaction of coal, as well as for the creation of hydrogen.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Reul sincerely for the fruitful cooperation in preparing this report, which demonstrates a comprehensive, balanced and long-term approach to the problems of fossil fuels and atomic energy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Reul, and my other fellow Members, who have come up with valid amendments, on their well-balanced report and all the hard work they have put into it.</p>
      <p sl="lt">All the energy sources covered in the report have been given a sufficient amount of attention, while at the same time, the importance of alternative energy sources and new energy technologies was duly pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Energy diversification is of great importance in ensuring energy security, which happens to be vital to my country, Lithuania. This area is definitely vulnerable, as my country is fully dependant on one supplier, without any other alternative so far. A possible solution could be the construction of a safe, modern nuclear power plant. It would be the basis for both our political security and economic stability.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Discussions on this report involved sharing different views on the future of nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Although we should fully recognise the importance of alternative energy sources and their possible dominating role in the future, we should nevertheless develop a down-to-earth approach to nuclear energy and face the fact that 30% of the energy produced in the EU is produced by nuclear power plants. This energy contributes to the implementation of the Kyoto objectives as well as to increasing the security of energy supply.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I consider the amendments so energetically presented by the ‘green’ politicians who condemn nuclear power in the name of the security of European citizens to be hypocritical, as it could contribute to the increased insecurity of other European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to encourage my fellow Members to be tolerant and to support the provisions enabling each nation to decide whether it is for or against the use of safe nuclear energy. Only by sharing our views and listening to different opinions will we be able to come to the right decision.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in this debate on conventional energy sources and energy technology, I would like to thank Herbert Reul for preparing a comprehensive report on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, the author of the report is right to note that the most important issue, also in terms of the future of energy generated from conventional fuels, is for the countries of the European Union to work together in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, with regard to the fact that the European Union’s dependence on fossil fuel imports will rise to about 70% by 2030, and, in the case of oil imports, to as much as 94%, it is essential to make maximum use of fossil fuel resources within the countries of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, coal is just such a resource, with Germany holding as much as 7% of the world’s reserves and Poland 2% of these reserves. It is important not to call into question the extraction of this fuel and the generation of energy from it, since electricity generated from fossil fuels is still half the price of electricity generated from renewable sources.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fourthly, because of the ecological risks associated with the generation of electricity from coal, joint European investment is needed into research in new technologies in this area, financed from funds from the European Union budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fifthly and finally, support is needed for European Union countries investing in atomic energy. In this context I would like to draw your attention to the agreement that has been drawn up for the construction of a modern nuclear power station in Ignalin, which is a joint project between Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, may I say to Mr Reul that, since it has been more or less announced that the Greens do not approve of this report, I intend to focus on the points that I found most disturbing. These are also reflected in the amendments we have tabled.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the drafting of this report it was impossible to engage in any critical reflection on nuclear energy. All the problems in Europe associated with the demise of the safety culture in our nuclear plants were off-limits, even though the incidents in Germany involving reactors operated by the Vattenfall company had just provided a glaring cautionary example. Discussion of the difficulty of funding waste disposal was likewise off-limits, as was the increasing threat of nuclear material being misused to build bombs or possibly for terrorist purposes.</p>
      <p sl="de">I must tell you, Mr Reul, that there is one thing which has truly driven me to distraction, and I shall say this before we meet in Bratislava. It is the fact that in Slovakia now, in 2007, the Italian ENEL company is planning to complete a nuclear plant that was developed in the Soviet Union before Chernobyl. Construction began in Czechoslovakia in the early eighties, and two thirds of the construction work was completed. Now ENEL intends to finish building the plant without new planning permission and without having the plans checked for compliance with European standards. It is a disgrace.</p>
      <p sl="de">People who sing the praises of nuclear energy have no right to go on disregarding that disgrace.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, crude oil is more expensive than ever. This also has an effect on the price of other fossil fuels. The cost of all forms of energy is rising, as four fifths of the EU’s entire energy consumption is fossil fuel-based.</p>
      <p sl="fi">People are not prepared to reduce consumption, so there is a need for new technologies, greater energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and new nuclear technology, including research into nuclear fusion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">After the vote in the Committee’s report, the hopes and dreams for the main alternatives are linked to CCS technology and nuclear power. There are no guarantees, however, that liquefied carbon dioxide can be stored safely in perpetuity. There are no signs that there might be investment in the hydrogen economy within the context of the transport infrastructure, let alone the use of electric cars running on carbon dioxide-free electricity, as is called for in the report. It will probably take half a century to tame nuclear fusion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">All in all, the Commission’s proposal that by 2020 20% of the energy consumed in the EU should be produced with renewable fuels is just not credible. That will not be possible, at least not with renewable fuels produced in the EU’s own territory or in the EU’s big Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report under discussion presents far too optimistic a view because it suggests that fossil fuels will continue to be used, without any real alternatives and with no restraints at all. They will only stop being used if something forces the situation. We will be forced into this if natural resources run out before 2020, but it will not happen as a result of any systematic effort on the part of the EU Member States or an EU declaration. In fact, it will take not only volition, fine words and pious hopes, but also genuine action which challenges our present lifestyle.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Furthermore, the pricing system for electricity, where wholesale prices for electric power are determined by the power exchanges, should be rethought. The price is always set by electricity produced at the most expensive production costs as well as that produced based on the most expensive allowances. This is the price which all the producers get. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees that companies will spend the excessive profits they make this way on research into energy, as it is in the spirit of the times we live in that they distribute their profits in the form of dividends to their shareholders. Emission allowance trading is also a way to increase the profits of the electricity companies rather than reduce emissions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur is right to make the point that conventional sources of energy will remain indispensable for several decades to come. He is also right to call for diversification of energy sources and supplies, for safer and more environmentally conscious energy production and for more efficient energy use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are somewhat sceptical, however, about the grounds on which these measures are urged. In the first place, the stated reasons are largely a repetition of the myth that climate change is due to carbon dioxide emissions from human activity. Yet growing numbers of scientists, while not disputing the fact of climate change, for the climate is constantly changing, are calling into question the notion of global warming, the culpability of CO2 and the idea that the human race is behind it all. That being the case, the famous CCS (carbon capture and storage) technology – to which the report devotes much space but the long-term risks of which are unclear – sounds like a dodgy ‘quick fix’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, and despite the customary allusions to the Member States having primary responsibility for their energy choices, the rapporteur cannot help trying to steer them in a certain direction. Consider the space that his report devotes to the nuclear option – which remains entirely a matter of sovereign choice for each Member State and which cannot be considered solely from the perspective of CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, no mention whatever is made of globalisation as contributing to the over-use of fossil fuels. The promotion of international exchanges of goods at the expense of shorter, local and national, supply circuits is by no means irrelevant here. What the Commission has been doing for years through its ultra-liberal trade policy and the opening of our markets to global competition without a scrap of protection for our economies – whatever its underlying rationale – is very largely responsible for creating the problems that the Commission now claims it wants to resolve.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is much to commend in this report. Of course it makes the ritual genuflection to climate change hysteria, despite the increasing doubts over the supposed link between CO2 and climate. However, it also recognises the importance of diversifying energy supplies and of using fossil fuels, including coal, in the energy mix. It emphasises the need for energy security, and in this context rightly points to the need for energy efficiency, for continuing use of domestic resources, including coal, and for nuclear energy – both the current use of fission and the vital research on fusion, which is the great hope for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The most remarkable factor in the energy debate is the way that the Greens and their fellow travellers agonise over carbon emissions but oppose the only mainstream low-carbon-generation technology. With oil at USD 90 a barrel, it is time for Ms Harms to recognise that nuclear power is the cheapest, safest, cleanest, most sustainable and most predictable base-load-generating technology available. As my colleague Mr Vidal-Quadras has said, nuclear waste disposal is simply a technical problem which has now been solved.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to acknowledge the work of the rapporteur, who prepared a well-balanced and realistic report, which reflects the latest developments. I also appreciate this initiative by Parliament, as it is one of the few reports dealing with conventional energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am convinced that in the next few decades fossil fuels will continue to be irreplaceable in the energy mix: they should therefore be given due consideration. Renewable energy sources are important, though they cannot replace conventional sources. As stated in this report, our efforts should aim at developing new technologies which allow for energy production with less environmental impact, such as clean coal technology. Nowadays, when we are experiencing ever-growing energy consumption on the one hand, and a lack of technologies to replace the existing energy sources on the other, an overly unidirectional orientation towards renewable sources could paradoxically accelerate the growth of Member States’ dependency on energy imports from other countries. Because energy has become the most strategic of commodities, the debates on complete replacing conventional sources may be popular but are very irresponsible.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I regard as a triumph of common sense the fact that this report devotes sufficient attention to nuclear energy. If we are serious about the strategy for reducing the levels of CO2 emissions close to zero, we cannot reject nuclear energy, which is without question one of the cleanest energy sources. We should not remain alone in our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, but strive to convince other superpowers to join us. Unless countries such as the US, China and India take similar measures, the measures we take will not have any real impact on a global scale because they can influence roughly only one seventh of global CO2 production.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In conclusion, I would like to suggest that the rapporteur study more carefully the differences between nuclear reactors. There is no comparison between the reactor that exploded in Chernobyl and those installed in the Czech Republic.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Reul’s report begs the important question of what direction Europe and the world are going in on the energy question. The conflicts continue. For how long can we contain them?</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is no easy alternative to fossil energy, given current conditions, not even if we did what we could to save far more energy than we do now. Oil accounts for around 37% of the energy we use, gas 24% and coal 16%. Fossil fuels thus account for 77% of all our energy. We know that the International Energy Agency predicts that world energy consumption will grow by more than one and a half times each year. Consumption of fossil energy is expected to increase by even more than that because the large developing countries have little faith in wind power stations. The developing countries account for 70% of growth in energy consumption, and China alone represents 30% of that growth. The reserves of fossil fuels are therefore running out and are concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It will take decades to change the energy system. Time is running out; this is actually a race against time. Unless we can sort out the environmental and energy problems we cannot guarantee peace.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If I could mention some areas of action: we need intensive research, product development and new technologies, and we also need to change our behaviour. In Europe we do not even conduct intensive research, even though we are heading for greater dependence, higher prices and conflict. I just heard that the United States of America spends five times more money on environmental research than the Union. How is it that the Lisbon knowledge-based economy works in this way?</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, it needs to be said that energy has its social dimension. Prices have risen by 50% in just a few years.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Reul’s report is a very good and thorough report and I congratulate him on it. I am astonished, however, at the space it devotes to coal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Coal is undoubtedly an abundant energy source. It is also the world’s most widespread source of fossil energy. I am concerned, however, at its increasingly predominant role in electricity generation. The impression is given that carbon capture and storage technology will solve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations, but I must confess that I am sceptical. There are coal-fired power stations all over the world: is it possible to equip them all with carbon capture systems? How will we manage to prevent CO2 emissions from the so-called ‘clean’ coal-fired plants? Is there not a risk that, having already experienced the eras of wood burning, coal burning and oil burning, we might now be taking a backward step into another coal burning era?</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude on a more optimistic note, the report’s strength lies, in my opinion, in its proposal for the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. The plan needs to address the necessary diversification of energy sources by 2020, 2030 and 2050 and it must also reflect the importance of resource use at regional level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, of the energy sources listed in the report, it is only coal, whether it be hard coal or brown coal, that is available in large amounts within the European Union. By and large, we have to import the other energy fuels. Energy requirements will increase in line with growth. At present it is not clear how successful we will be in developing production from renewable energy sources or from hydrogen batteries, but these too need energy supplies. For this reason, despite enormous efforts, we should not give up on coal too quickly as an accessible source of energy. We are not doing enough to develop clean energy from coal. More resources should be put into processing coal and into improving the efficiency of boilers and generators. We must maintain energy security and one of the elements of this is the coal that is available in nearly all EU countries. We cannot afford to dislike our natural riches.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, it is good to see you burning the midnight oil along with us.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Europe, we have a vast renewable energy potential. In Scotland, we know that better than most. As Ms Harms has said, my Group has a number of difficulties with the pro-nuclear aspects of this report. But my own view is that we must also make sure that we do research into other, non-nuclear sources of power and research into ways to make them better.</p>
      <p sl="en">In paragraph 47, carbon-capture is experimental but it is promising, and in paragraph 47 we call on the Commission to lay down, as soon as possible, clear political guidelines for the promotion of research into carbon capture and storage. Commissioner, I am delighted to hear you are going to do that. It is important because, left to their own devices, the Member States will not come up with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Scotland, we had at Peterhead a world-leading proposal for a demonstrator site. Because of political uncertainty entirely caused by the London Government not making it a priority, the project is going ahead – and it is going ahead in California.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe can have a lead in this; we can be globally significant in the research potential that we have, but we must have real action. I am glad to hear that this report has some ideas which the Commission is taking forward.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to make 10 points regarding the report by Mr Reul. It is an excellent and well-balanced report, which, in my opinion, is written in the spirit of Antoine de Saint Exupéry’s words about our future: our task is not to foresee it, but to enable it.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The report lists practically all the conventional energy sources, except perhaps, to please the Green Members here, for ebonite sticks and fox tails. Jokes aside, I recognise the exhaustive manner with which the report encompasses the general regulations governing the energy sector. As Professor Semjonov’s historical findings confirm, since prehistoric and ancient times the same basic laws have applied: on the one hand humans have tried to lower the energy intensity of technologies, while on the other hand they have strived to produce more energy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, today an effective combination of energy sources and diversification of gas imports is vital. The weight of the European single market should be increased as a factor for guaranteeing the stability and reliability of supplies.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There are of course environmental risks involved, which would need to be carefully assessed. The rapporteur, Mr Reul, refers for example to the Arctic shelves, which, according to some estimates, account for up to 25% of new gas and oil sources.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission will undoubtedly be asked to take measures to reduce the energy intensity per unit of GDP. Another essential task is drawing up a reasonable technology transfer policy.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Reul, on his excellent report. This reports captures the status quo in the area of conventional energy sources and technologies, and at the same time draws attention, in a complex way, towards many aspects of their further use in the context of both securing energy supplies and the need to continuously increase emissions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Since there is an increasing need for energy on a global scale, the European Union cannot afford to completely eliminate fossil fuels since they play an important part in overall energy production although their reserves keep diminishing. In spite of the fact that the European Union is on average relatively effective in producing energies from these conventional sources, some Member States could do still much more in the area of introducing and supporting new, more effective technologies and developing new, more effective cooperation units. Nor should the Member States create needless obstacles to new investments in the use of fossil reserves through the most advanced technologies available.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another issue I want to concentrate on is nuclear energy. As we know, nuclear energy generates practically no CO2 emissions and I am convinced that sooner or later it will find its place even in those Member States that so far have been against it for ideological rather than pragmatic reasons. Since new technologies, such as fourth-generation reactors, are constantly developing (even in Russia, Mrs Harms), there are now options in place for further improvements to their operating safety and for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel.</p>
      <p sl="sk">To conclude, I would like to say that I appreciate that the work of the Commission shows a tangible tilt towards more a open and objective view and evaluation of the benefits of nuclear energy, resulting in initiatives such as the European Nuclear Energy Forum, the inaugural meeting of which will be held in Bratislava in November later this year, as mentioned in this House. Europe has long been lacking such a permanent platform for discussion, contributing to the exchange of knowledge, information and opinion. Such exchange will be useful both to the experts and the public in general, and I assume that it will be useful to the Greens as well.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to touch on two points. The first is one on which I hope and believe we are firmly united, namely the view that conventional sources and forms of energy and technology will continue to play a major role in the future. The idea that we can replace everything with energy from alternative sources is illusory. We must, however, make conventional technology environment-friendlier – that is absolutely essential – and we must also ensure that conventional forms of technology become more efficient. These are the views we share, and in these respects the report can be strongly endorsed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation is perhaps somewhat different with regard to nuclear technology. It must be absolutely clear, with no ifs or buts, that every country can choose its own forms of technology, in other words it can opt for nuclear technology or choose to get by without recourse to the nuclear option.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another principle that must be common to all of us is the primacy of safety – not only safety in the energy production process but also, of course, safe final disposal and, what is very important in today’s world, where the significance of the global dimension is constantly growing, the non-proliferation of nuclear technology that can be used for military purposes.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would have liked to see the report focus rather more sharply on these issues. We have, admittedly, addressed them in other reports, and I believe Europe must set the best of examples in this field. Regardless of what might be called the ideological stance – whether we are for or against nuclear technology – safety must be absolutely paramount. I hope that we in this Parliament and, of course, the Commission will be increasingly vigilant so as to ensure that all safety issues, including non-proliferation, remain in the foreground, otherwise we shall be failing in our responsibility for mankind and for peace in the world. I hope that this message might yet come across more clearly tomorrow in some amendments than it does in Mr Reul’s report.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Geopolitical interests and the striking of balances, the level of technological development and its impact on the economy create the necessary conditions for a second chance to nuclear energy as an important element of the energy mix. This theme is very important and topical against the backdrop of the heated debate on the climate change, the security of energy supplies and the alternative power generation solution.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In my country Bulgaria, Kozlodui Nuclear Power Plant acounted for 43 % of the total power generation in the country, contributing to the sustainable development of the economy in 2006. Of course, these figures pertain to the period before the closing down of units three and four of the nuclear power plant on 31 December 2006. Analyses reveal that in the next few decades to come the consumption of electricity will double globally. All over the world, 31 reactors are under construction and others are in the planning phase. This dynamic process comes to show that active efforts are being made to seek solutions in order to overcome the challenges facing modern economies, to provide inexpensive and clean energy, to cope with the climate change, to observe the greenhouse emission quotas under the Kyoto Protocol, to safeguard the security of supplies and to reduce the dependence on imported gas and oil. And if I recall yeat another fact, i.e. currently nuclear power plants generate one-third of the elecrticity in the European Union, then I would conclude that perhaps the time for a nuclear Renaissance has come.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, the report should be commended for including all sectors of the energy mix while looking at conventional sources in particular. We certainly need to step up the effectiveness of fossil fuel use.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am convinced, however, that there are several reasons why we cannot do without nuclear energy. Sustainable development, preservation of competitiveness in the broadest sense, true environmental protection and emission reductions are just some of these reasons. We are finally beginning to discuss nuclear energy without letting unhelpful feelings and emotions guide us, although some of the amendments tabled and even some of the contributions still do not bear witness to this.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am therefore glad to hear realistic voices from the Commission and other EU institutions saying that we need to incorporate nuclear energy even in the future. In many countries nuclear energy already represents a key source, and is a guarantee of the much-discussed notion of energy independence and security.

      <p sl="es">Our colleague Herbert Reul has done a magnificent job throughout the debate in committee and has produced a sound, consistent text which fully encompasses the concerns of the majority of MEPs.</p>
      <p sl="es">For a long time, fossil fuels and nuclear energy will continue to be the nub of our energy mix and despite the ambitious targets we have set ourselves for renewables, the contribution that they make will not be truly significant for several decades. Therefore, we must not temper efforts to research, develop and innovate in conventional sources since fulfilling our commitments in relation to climate change, security of supply and competitiveness involves achieving a more sustainable use of these sources.</p>
      <p sl="es">The result of the committee vote was excellent as it highlighted the progress made in controlling the capture of carbon dioxide, in improving energy efficiency in the generation of electricity, in the contribution which synthetic fuels for transport can make, and in the competitiveness of the nuclear sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">One Group in this House has tabled almost 40 amendments to the nuclear section seeking to change all objective and realistic references to nuclear fuels to references to renewable sources. I would like to remind them that this matter has already been voted on at a previous plenary sitting and, allow me please to tell the Group concerned, that it is free to live in a world divorced from reality, but that we will all suffer the consequences if their obsessions ultimately mean that their arguments prevail.

      <p sl="bg">Allow me, first and foremost, to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Reul on his objective and balanced report. A major distinctive feature of the report is the clear outline of the role of conventional energy sources, the need for their increasingly efficient use through new technologies to achieve the energy security of the European Union with maximum compliance with the sustainable development goals and the combat against climate changes. I would like to support the conclusion that the increased investment in energy technologies at the European and national levels would not only contribute to the attainment of the EU energy goals but it would also enhance its capabilities to export facilities in compliance with the higher efficiency and security standards.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like to single out that section of the report which deals with nuclear energy not only because of its leading place in the generation of power from conventional sources but also because of the vital importance for nuclear energy to observe the highest nuclear safety standards. In this sense, the support to the appeal of the Commission to introduce common nuclear safety reference levels in the European Union is a crucial aspect of the report. I would like to specially emphasize the fact that Bulgaria, which intends to build a new nuclear power plant, takes great interest in the enhanced role of the European Union in the observance of high nuclear safety standards, as well as in the creation of favourable investment conditions for these large-scale projects that call for big financial, material and intellectual resource input. The work of the European Union, including the High-level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management and the existing Nuclear Energy Forum, will contribute to the incorporation of nuclear energy into the EU policies in a more objective manner.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, necessary though it is to enact measures to combat climate change and promote renewables, it is extremely important that Parliament should also deal with the future of conventional energy sources. The Reul report emphasises the huge importance of coal and nuclear power to the regional economy. We have 300 000 European jobs in coalmining alone. Additional economic strength is provided by the power stations and through tax revenue. Some 60% of our electricity generation is based on European coal or nuclear power. Of course we must increase the efficiency and safety of these energy sources. Of course we must also seek to protect the environment by developing additional legal provisions governing matters such as carbon emissions.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, we must not turn the legislative screw so tight that coal loses its international competitiveness. The fact is that renewable energy sources will not be able to grow as quickly as we would wish. We face the threat of restrictions on our independence in the field of foreign policy and arbitrary actions on the part of our energy suppliers. The only way to avoid that threat in future is with a strategic energy mix which also includes coal and nuclear power.</p>

      <p sl="et">If climate change is to be brought under control it is important to reduce carbon emissions from combustion of fossil fuels to near zero. However, in order to prevent and mitigate the unwanted effects of climate change action must be taken now. Clean coal technology may prove to be possible, but we cannot pin all our hopes on it at present. The European Union must significantly reduce current greenhouse gas emissions and that must remain the cornerstone of our climate policy. I am pleased that the European Parliament Temporary Committee on Climate Change has recently approved a strong line for our negotiations at the Bali Climate Conference in December.</p>
      <p sl="et">Where clean coal technology is concerned, the funds currently available for the necessary research can of course be increased because the matter must be researched. However, we cannot spend decades waiting for research findings without doing anything else and therefore we must now concentrate on measures which must be implemented immediately, namely reducing CO2 emissions, energy-saving measures and a general transition to renewable sources of energy.</p>
      <p sl="et">The vote of the ITRE committee has resulted in too great an emphasis on nuclear energy in the Reul report and there has been too little discussion of renewables. Therefore I fully support the amendments tabled in the House, as they help to balance the report. In particular I call upon you to support the proposed amendments recommending that the European Commission make renewables the central focus of its own European Strategic Energy Technology Plan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I must commend Mr Reul for skilfully steering his report through about 200 committee-stage amendments to provide this House with a very balanced, consistent and honest report that is highly relevant to the challenges we face today and in the future. Many of those defeated amendments have reappeared at the last minute, and we in plenary must throw them out again. These amendments damage not only the report: in the end, they damage the environment that some of the proposals claim to represent.</p>
      <p sl="en">I use the word ‘honest’ most deliberately, because Mr Reul has used real words like ‘coal’ and ‘nuclear’, rather than hiding behind the generalities of what might or might not be sustainable or renewable, and it is clear that we will continue to rely on burning fossil fuels for generations to come. Of course we support renewables. We do so because they provide necessary, clean energy. However, in most Member States, renewable energy can meet neither our environmental targets, nor our accelerated energy demands, nor our need to remain competitive in global markets. As responsible politicians, we must discard the dogmas of the past and recognise that all clean technologies have their role to play. Quite simply, we must retain and advance the nuclear share – and we will still not be doing enough. In my country, Bulgaria, we were needlessly required to close 2 000 MW of safe, clean nuclear power.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, despite the ambitious targets we have set ourselves, it would appear that we all agree that conventional sources of energy will continue to be an important part of our energy mix. Therefore, nuclear energy will also continue to play an important role as it is still necessary in order to ensure security and stability of supply in many countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">To that end it is reasonable for research to be carried out in areas where nuclear energy’s weaknesses are more apparent such as safety or treatment of waste, but we should note that the report clearly endorses the idea that the nuclear option falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States, as Mr Reul noted at the outset.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it would appear that some people intend Europe to entrust its future almost exclusively to nuclear energy, making the development of renewables, increased efficiency or research subordinate to it. There is one small detail which we should ponder: what are the public’s views on this?</p>
      <p sl="es">We have very much taken the reality of the situation into account but, of course, we must have clear priorities and in that regard it should be noted that the importance of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan which the Commission is due to submit to us soon is one very important aspect of this.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that the main objective should be to reduce the cost of renewables, to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, industry and transport, and to make progress in low carbon technologies. Europe and the Member States should make these objectives their political priority and the focus of their efforts to build a future energy policy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The gross energy production in the European Union is achieved based on various energy sources: 31% nuclear energy, 29% coal, 19% gas, 14% sources of renewable energy and 5% oil.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Romania produces 13.5% of its energy from oil, 15.3% from coal and coke and 5.9% is hydroelectric and nuclear-electrical energy. As regards nuclear energy, it is essential to ensure its security and, especially, adequate waste treatment. Generation IV nuclear energy systems will allow better nuclear waste management and decrease its quantity. Nevertheless, an extremely important element for environmental protection should refer to the treatment of water used to cool reactors. For this reason, the investments in the security and treatment of radioactive waste should be a priority for the countries that generate nuclear energy. The Black Sea region is extremely important for diversifying the European Union’s sources of energy. The region has a strategic importance, not only for the transportation of hydrocarbons from the Caspian Sea region to the European Union, but also for the coal resources existing in Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia. It is important for the coal industry to provide work safety and health conditions. As long as coal is a source of energy, it is important to have the necessary investments in order to provide workplace safety.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs. It is a particular achievement of this report that the European Parliament has realised beyond any shadow of a doubt, and accepted, that ideological concerns cannot override environmental and economic necessity. Some of the current Member States have attempted to do just this over the past half-century but, as we know, were unsuccessful. It was in 1956 that Hungary abandoned the vain political notion that it could be a country of iron and steel. Fortunately the European Union has not had to go to such extremes to realise and acknowledge that we will need all our knowledge and all our resources if we are to meet our energy requirements securely in the 21st century. This calls for the maximum possible diversification in terms of both sources and technologies. Ideology cannot decide what sort of footing Europe’s energy supply will rest on in 10, 20 or 50 years’ time; science must decide. The politicians’ role is to demand safety, coordinate sources, and increase public acceptance. For this task I wish all of us – as Hungarian miners would say – ‘jó szerencsét’, may we come out safely at the end of the day!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as was mentioned, this is the third report on the Commission decision and the later decision of the European Council. The Vidal-Quadras report has helped us formulate the internal market package. The Thomsen report will have a huge influence on our proposals on renewables. I can also promise that we will follow the vote on the Reul report very carefully, because the outcome of that report will influence the approach to CCS – first of all the legal proposal and also the report – and also our Strategic Energy Technology Plan and our future policy, as far as the Euratom Treaty gives us a mandate for nuclear energy. That is why this vote will be very carefully followed by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time I would like to emphasise a couple of points. It was mentioned that we need to modernise the energy sector. If I recall – now, in 2007 – the first debate in 2004, I believe we have achieved a lot. Definitely, security of supply and climate change are closely related, with perhaps just one major difference at this stage, which is the cost for carbon sequestration, but I believe oil price developments will help.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, weather challenges were mentioned. We do not invest in sufficient resources. We should really decide on priorities. Without massive investment in research and development in the energy sector, we will not succeed. I believe the three-year debate was very helpful to prepare the ground. But now it is really time to address the issues. How can one claim, for example, that some Member States are dependent on third countries when the Structural Funds are not being used for energy at all, or practically not at all!</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say also the part in national budgets for research and development is small. So these are the crucial issues to deal with. I am afraid that not much time is left until we have some serious perturbation in the market. So, we need to act, and to act now, on the basis on which Parliament has worked so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was also mention of one particular issue: that we need sufficient energy resources. Sufficient resources need energy demand management. Here again, Parliament has moved and the Commission has moved, and at the same time I needed to start 12 infringement cases for not communicating energy efficiency action plans, the basis for action on energy demand.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to demand and dependence on third countries, this is also something that we should overcome. I think the Saryusz-Wolski report was a courageous attempt to go for it. If one Member State is being blackmailed by a supplier, it should speak out. Because the basic reason is that we have a common foreign and security policy (CFSP) that could give the necessary grounds for common action, and I believe that any country that has enough courage to blackmail any of the EU countries will think twice, or never again blackmail, if this is spoken of and discussed in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last part of my intervention will be on nuclear energy. It is very clear that, under the Reform Treaty, the energy mix comes under national decision-making. That means that the decision on nuclear energy is to be made by each and every Member State. But it should also be understood that conditions now definitely demand that the legislation in place should guarantee transparency and predictability, because it is a very long-term investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Swoboda also mentioned non-proliferation issues. We are looking at these, but in my opinion, it is very clear that the CFSP has priority and Euratom should fill in and help. It is definitely the CFSP that should lead our activities on non-proliferation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two very concrete responses. First of all, Mochovce. Slovenské Elektrárne has indeed notified its intention to construct a nuclear power plant. It is for a VVR reactor 440/213 but it is not of the Chernobyl type. The Commission, in accordance with Article 41 of the Euratom Treaty, will prepare an opinion, taking full account of all the challenges this decision poses. This will take time, but you can be assured that the Commission will perform the correct assessment and will not hesitate if we have any doubts about the safety of this equipment.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of coming here to talk about the closure of some of the nuclear units, a debate on this issue would not be productive. This issue was agreed by the experts who prepared the ground. It was discussed at a political level and it was agreed at government level and sealed by a referendum in all the Member States, including the countries where these reactors are. Please do not return to this, because it distracts us from future developments. There is no way these reactors will get the green light for prolonging their work time. This is a dead end. Please understand that there will be no development.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know, perhaps, you have personal views on it, but there will definitely not be developed, at least from the European Commission. The opinion has been formed. It was democratically agreed, and let us keep and honour the commitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I greatly appreciate the report that has been drawn up. It is a very difficult report and I believe it has got the accent right. I hope that the vote will definitely help us finalise the paper that we are to prepare by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">A6-0327/2007 by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board [COM(2006)0599 – C6-0348/2006 – 2006/0199(COD) ] and</p>

    <intervention id="1-198" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005 the Commission, with the support of the Council and Parliament, embarked on a process to reform statistical governance in the European Union with the aim of strengthening the independence, integrity and responsibility of the national statistics institutes of all the Member States of the Union and, of course, of Eurostat, the European Statistical Office.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first aspect of this process was the adoption in May 2005 of a European Statistics Code of Practice. Implementation of that code resulted in closer cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistics institutes and in improved reliability of statistical data gathered for many purposes; in particular, however, I would like to refer to one objective which has been the subject of debate here over the years, namely the excessive public deficit procedure.</p>
      <p sl="es">When it proposed the Code of Practice, the Commission also recommended that the self-regulatory focus should be counter-balanced by the establishment of a reporting system to monitor adherence to the code. That gave rise to the idea of establishing an independent external advisory body to play an active role in monitoring implementation of the Code of Practice in the European statistical system as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time the Commission noted that it was appropriate to review the operation and composition of the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres, with the aim of making it more efficient and allowing it to play a more strategic role. The ECOFIN Council and, more generally, the national statistics authorities welcomed both recommendations and the Commission implemented them in a dual proposal in October last year; we are debating those proposals today with the prospect that, and I hope we will be able to confirm whether you agree with me here, they will be adopted at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">To that end I would especially like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Bowles and Mrs Van den Burg, on their work and the quality of their reports.</p>
      <p sl="es">This process of strengthening European statistical governance is supplemented by a new Commission proposal adopted on 16 October, only a few days ago, to review the Regulation on the production of European statistics. That proposal is also subject to Council and Parliamentary approval under the codecision procedure and we will therefore have the opportunity to debate it again here in the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="es">This set of initiatives will provide the Union with a modern, reliable, efficient European statistical system capable of improving public confidence in official statistical data. I refer once again to the debates we have often had in this House in recent years on the importance of reliable budget data, or reliable data for other national public accounts, GDP etc., or the need to have a price index upon which the public can fully rely.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards the reports we are debating tonight, allow me to point out simply that from our point of view it would have been preferable if there were greater respect for the institutional balance, as envisaged, in our view, in the initial proposal, in relation to the appointment of members of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board and the drafting and transmission of that Board’s reports. In any event, the Commission acknowledges that the amendments to the original proposals are unquestionably important, they have the support of the Council and Parliament and they do not alter the substance of our original proposals.</p>
      <p sl="es">In view of this, Mr President, before I close I would like to reiterate my thanks to the rapporteurs, and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent work and for the continuous support for the Commission’s work to modernise our statistical system and make it more reliable and more robust.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this decision concerns the setting up of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board. Statistics are used by Member States, by the EU, internationally and by many other stakeholders for a variety of purposes. They are used, for example, by the European Central Bank, for economic analysis; the Commission, through Eurostat, produces statistics that are compiled from data produced by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few years ago questions arose over the credibility of statistics being provided by some Member States to the EU institutions, and it was clear that some kind of quality control was needed. As the Commissioner has said, in response, a Code of Conduct on statistical procedures was compiled. In order to provide a check for consistency and adherence to the Code of Practice, each national statistical office is checked by peer review which involves another Member State and Eurostat. As a further check, it was also proposed to introduce an independent, high-level advisory board. It is that board, now called the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board, which is the subject of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is fair to say that there is a high degree of sensitivity on all sides about how intrusive the role of the Board can be. I am grateful to the current Portuguese Presidency, and, before them, the German Presidency, and also to the Commission for being frank with me about these sensitivities. Parliament, of course, was determined that the Board had to be more than a rubber stamp for the Commission’s report. However, we have achieved agreement around a balanced and workable proposal which includes most of Parliament’s amendments in some form or another. I am particularly pleased that we have been able to agree with the Council that dialogue should be encouraged, not only between the Board and this Statistical Programme Committee and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, but also with Member States’ stakeholder bodies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Board will report to Parliament and the Council and will include in its report an assessment of their implementation of the Code of Practice in the European Statistical System as a whole. The Board will also advise the Commission on appropriate measures to facilitate implementation of the Code of Practice as it relates to Eurostat and to the European Statistical System as a whole. It will further advise on communicating the Code of Practice to users and data providers and on updating the Code of Practice. Measures to ensure the independence of the Board and involving the Parliament in the appointments have also been included. So, after consulting the Commission, the Council selects and the European Parliament approves the nomination of the chairperson of the Board. Parliament and the Council each appoint three members of the Board. The chairperson is not to be a current member of a national statistical office, or of the Commission, or to have held such a post within the last two years. We considered similar exclusions on all members but that is not really practical. However, we have added a requirement that the Board provide a range of complementary skills and experience. Just in case we have not got the balance right, the Board itself should be in a position to know whether it has been frustrated or not, so there is a review clause after three years. This will give sufficient time for the Board and others to be able to indicate whether the procedures are working and effective or whether there are changes that are necessary, and this must be a serous review.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission have had a very effective dialogue on this dossier, and I thank them. I am pleased to be in a position to be able to lead this proposal through in a single reading with the support from shadow rapporteurs, whom I also thank.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first make two preliminary remarks. One is that, obviously, this subject of statistics is not a very sexy subject and is always placed at the end of the agenda. But what concerns me a bit is that there are politicians, MEPs and others who often like to complain about the provision of statistics. But then, if there is an opportunity to really improve something, they are not really actively involved in making the situation better.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second remark is that I hope the Commissioner, at least, will appreciate that we are having this debate. Ms Bowles and I have said that, for us, it is not really necessary to have the debate. But it is important to underline the fact that you have done something on statistics, and that issue deserves some attention. So I hope you will not blame us for keeping you here at this hour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me, then, congratulate you on the very concrete measures that you have taken vis-à-vis these problems with statistics, which have appeared several times in recent history. I know that you had to do this in the political room for manoeuvre that is granted to you by the Council, because we are aware that the European Commission cannot oblige Member States to establish independent statistical offices and prescribe to them how to work and how to deal with figures and data.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ministers and MEPs who are the loudest and firmest in complaining about the lack of reliability of the figures of others are also the ones who do not want you to mix in their business and infringe on their autonomy and their way of dealing with statistics. This is the problem you have to deal with.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, in this context, I think it was wise of you, Commissioner, to take a pragmatic, bottom-up approach, to focus on peer reviews and a code of practice, and to reform the governance structure of the statistics system by creating a new high level governance board, which Ms Bowles was speaking about, and by reforming the existing European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres (CEIES), which dealt with economic and social statistics, into a more streamlined and smaller advisory committee with a broader mandate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Ms Bowles’ and my report we have tried to improve this even more, and to reinforce and strengthen the approach of the Commission. At the same time, we have also made sure – in accordance with your proposal – that these two new bodies in the European family can function properly and with more independence from the Commission and Eurostat.</p>
      <p sl="en">This may not have been completely in line with the Commission’s intentions; however, I want to express my appreciation to the Director-General of Eurostat for very generously accepting the fact that we took away his voting rights in the system that we designed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to express my appreciation to the Portuguese Presidency, and to Ms Cordeiro, for the efficient way she chaired the Council working group and negotiated with us a first reading agreement on this issue. This was a very efficient and very time- and bureaucracy-saving procedure. So, Mr Hans-Peter Martin, who has also asked for the floor, can see an example of how we can deal in a very efficient way with this type of co-decision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me very briefly give some of the elements of the statistical board, which I will do in writing. If you read the dossier, you can find where we made the changes, so I will not repeat this here but will stick to my wish that these two bodies will really bring some consciousness and some improvement in the way the statistics systems function, and will help us to really have reliable figures and base our economic activities on reliable data.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, improving the European statistical system is part of the wider task of sound economic governance in the Union, particularly with regard to adjustment of the Stability and Growth Pact. I share the wish expressed by both the Commission and the Member States to enhance the quality of statistical information. As I see it, determining what constitutes an excessive deficit depends on the reliability of the data. Unreliable data puts the entire Stability and Growth Pact in jeopardy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In return for flexibility in implementation of the pact, which was introduced under the reform adopted by the March 2005 European Council, the necessary figures must be indisputable and verifiable. Flexibility is important too in the current context of enlargement of the euro zone. We need to learn the lessons of past experience! The European Union has already been obliged to review the statistics relating to a Member State’s budget deficit and level of debt; now several Member States want to join the euro zone, so the volume of statistical information to be processed will increase, as will the number of parties involved in the discussions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The proposed improvement to the European statistical system aims to address legitimate concerns that have been raised concerning the validity of the data which Member States supply and the system for checking them. We need to take care that doubt is not cast over the entire statistical system and over Eurostat’s ability to verify the budget data which the Member States provide.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For these reasons I support the reform, which will result firstly in the establishment of a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy and secondly in the creation of a European Statistical Governance Advisory Board – both bodies capable of actively helping to monitor implementation of the code of conduct throughout the entire European statistical system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have no hesitation in supporting the proposals made by our two excellent rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you have already pointed out, Commissioner, statistics are vitally important to both the European Union and the Member States in many policy areas. If wrong decisions and unwelcome developments are to be avoided, statistics must be meaningful, reliable, open to only one interpretation and therefore comparable too. That, unfortunately, has not always been the case. I therefore welcome the establishment of the European Statistical Advisory Committee and the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board. The amendments tabled by the European Parliament will, I hope, endow both bodies with the authority they will need.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me emphasise first of all that the Statistical Advisory Committee will be independent and that all stakeholder groups will be represented on it. The Committee will have far fewer members than its predecessor, the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres (CEIES), and the reduction from 79 to 24 members will make it considerably more efficient. I welcome the fact that the European Data Protection Supervisor is to be a voting member of the Advisory Committee, whereas the Director-General of Eurostat has only been granted non-voting membership. This underlines the Committee’s independence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the Statistical Governance Advisory Board is a useful complement to the Advisory Committee. The Board will monitor and, I hope, actively encourage the application of the Code of Conduct in all European statistical matters.</p>
      <p sl="de">One can only hope that, with the aid of these two bodies, the needs of users will have a greater impact on the statistical work programme and that the Code of Conduct will strike such firm roots that deliberately or mistakenly delivered misinformation or inaccurate data will become a thing of the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me conclude by thanking both rapporteurs for their work and for their willingness to discuss contentious points frankly and constructively.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation to Mrs Bowles and Mrs van den Burg for their reports.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should be aware of the role played by the European statistical system, which may be the world’s best system. We are talking here not just about the clarity of lists of figures, tables or charts. The most important issue is the reliability and completeness of statistical data at the level of the European Union, of the Member States, and also, and this I would like to emphasise, of the regions. For that purpose it is vital to ensure continuity of information as well as access to it. I would add here that only statistical data that have been collected and collated in the same way, in accordance with statistical principles, can be reliable and transparent, and will not be affected by short-term interests or passing priorities. My experience in regional policy has shown clearly that such risks exist.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason we should be pleased that we have an EU statistical programme for 2008-2012. To make it work will, however, need appropriate funding and, above all, will require appropriate consultation, monitoring of the code of statistical procedures as well as statistics management. This is very important in the light of the different systems used in Member States, the need to coordinate and unify them at the level of the 27 countries and statistical offices as well as Eurostat. In this context I would like to support both the reports.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is general agreement as to how important statistics are, and not just among the people who have managed to come here at this late hour. The question is whether the aim which I presume we are all pursuing will be achieved with the measures that are being initiated here. It made me wonder, Commissioner, when you spoke of another new regulation that was to be negotiated with us. Perhaps you can tell us whether its provisions will also affect these advisory bodies.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second question is this: there is always a great inherent danger with advisory bodies that they will become a law unto themselves and drag everything out. Would it not have made more sense at the end of the day to evaluate briefly, concisely and clearly, using external management consultants where necessary, the problems that have occurred with Eurostat and then come to a rapid agreement with Parliament rather than passing the buck again and shelving the issue? When all is said and done, every one of us knows that the crux of the problem is the interface between Eurostat and the national statistical offices. The best an advisory body can do is to put the problem back on the agenda, but it is certainly not going to establish real transparency and efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, first, thank you all, especially the rapporteurs but also all the other people who have spoken in the debate for your involvement and cooperation in improving statistical governance in the European Union and, via the second committee reform, for improving users’ involvement in the economic and social life of Europe with the aim of achieving a better statistical system, a more credible system.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we are talking about here is a system and, as Mrs Van den Burg said, both the European Statistics Agency (Eurostat) and the national statistics agencies of the 27 Member States must be equal to the demands and hopes we are vesting in them; they must cooperate, they have to work in a coordinated fashion, they have to spur each other on; hence the code of practice and the way in which it is being applied is, from my point of view, a very positive thing. I hope that this new body is able to assess its worth and to spur it on to work with the future in mind because it is very important in many fields to have access to good statistics.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Gauzès referred to the Growth and Stability Pact. I did so too in my initial speech. It is very important for us to have reliable figures when monitoring budgetary discipline in this multilateral framework. But it is also very important to have reliable figures on National Product to fund the European Union; it is also very important to have a reliable price index; similarly it is very important to have statistics on external trade; it is also very important to have statistics on external investment or on trade patterns or financial flows.</p>
      <p sl="es">In all the aspects we were discussing, or listening to, in my case, in the previous item, energy, extraordinary importance is attached to energy statistics, as it is to statistics on immigration or on matters related to what has thus far been known as the third pillar. There are many, so many areas of activity, practically all the areas of European Union activity, which need good statistics, that the importance of this debate, while not a very ‘sexy’ subject, as Mrs Van den Burg put it, is obvious and I hope that the two bodies are equal to what we are asking of them under these two regulations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another very important set of rules the ‘Statistics law’ is in the offing. Given the combination of this package and the very worthy efforts being made both by Eurostat and all the officials at the European Statistical Office and the national statistics institutes of the 27 Member States, I hope that in the next few years any doubts as to the quality of European statistics will be dispelled, if possible, and that this will result in greater effectiveness and finer tuning of our policies and our decisions to the demands and aspirations of European citizens because that is essentially what we are dealing with when we talk about statistics.</p>
