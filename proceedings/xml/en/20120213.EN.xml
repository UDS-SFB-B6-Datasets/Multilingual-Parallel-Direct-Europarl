      <p sl="unknown">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the debate on the oral question concerning the feasibility of introducing stability bonds take place after the joint debate on the agreement between the EU and Morocco. Would the Group of the Greens like to comment on this? Mr Cohn-Bendit, you have the floor.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to a case and to ask you to take the appropriate steps. I am given to believe by the Pusztaranger website – which is normally a reliable source of information – that the Hungarian journalist Zsolt Bayer has made wild attacks on Neelie Kroes, who is performing her duties in accordance with the rules of the European Union, and has made even wilder vulgar and obscene attacks on our fellow Member Ulrike Lunacek.</p>
      <p sl="de">You might say: well, he is a journalist. What does it have to do with us? However, we are talking here about a journalist who a short time ago organised a pro-Orbán demonstration in Hungary; a demonstration at which – according to various sources – anti-Semitic placards were displayed. I believe that the dignity of this House, but also the dignity of Ms Lunacek, obliges us to investigate this matter and to check whether the translations with which I have been provided are correct. This House must then defend both its own dignity and that of Ms Lunacek, irrespective of whether people are for or against Mr Orbán.</p>
      <p sl="de">Practices that are absolutely unacceptable are making inroads here. If Neelie Kroes is attacked by Members of this House for performing the duties she is legally bound to perform, that is also unacceptable. I believe that we should maintain a certain moral standard in our political argumentation and should not deal with each other in ways that are thoroughly unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that I myself am now being called a liar by various spokespersons in Hungary is merely incidental. The way in which Ms Lunacek is being presented to the public in Hungary, however, is absolutely intolerable. I ask that you investigate the matter and, if the reports turn out to be true, that you defend the dignity of Ms Lunacek and of this House.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Thank you very much, Mr Swoboda. Naturally I will look into the matter, obtain the appropriate documents and, should the dignity or the integrity of Ms Lunacek as a Member of this House have been attacked, will take the necessary action to defend her. I will also contact Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, regarding the extent to which the Commission needs to do the same to defend Ms Kroes. If appropriate, the two institutions could act jointly and in unison.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start this sitting by mentioning a case that I find extremely worrying; indeed, one that we should all find very worrying. It concerns a young Saudi Arabian journalist by the name of Hamza Kashgari. This young journalist was charged in Malaysia with making blasphemous statements on his Twitter account. He was handed over to Saudi Arabia at the request of the Saudi authorities. In Saudi Arabia he faces the death penalty for these allegedly blasphemous comments and is under threat of execution. There is no doubt that the religious feelings of every individual are to be respected. Even journalists have an obligation to do this. However, freedom of speech and freedom of thought are also universal values that we must all defend. For a young journalist to be executed in Saudi Arabia for a comment on Twitter, for a poem, cannot in any way be considered acceptable. I will therefore – subject to your agreement – do all I can to prevent this execution.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, a large number of Members have also spoken to me over the weekend and during the day today about the fact that the Dutch Freedom Party, the PVV, has set up a website inviting people to air their complaints about EU citizens from Central and Eastern Europe who have come to the Netherlands under the free movement of workers. Commissioner Reding has already issued a statement criticising this website in very strong terms. In her statement she emphasised the fact that we are an open continent in which citizens are free to move about and to work wherever and whenever they wish. At the request of many Members, I will make further investigations into this website – which I have not seen myself, so I am unable to comment on its content – and will bring up the matter with the Dutch Prime Minister Mr Rutte at a meeting we have planned for 1 March. I, too, find it very worrying, in view of the tone of Ms Reding’s comments.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, following on from what Ms Wortmann-Kool has been so good as to tell us: this is a sympathetic initiative, but this House should also pronounce publicly on the hate campaign which the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) is conducting through its website on which people anonymously post complaints about their fellow EU citizens.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement on the situation of the homeless in Europe as a result of the spell of cold weather.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-031-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, naturally, my colleagues and I in the Commission — particularly President Barroso and Commissioner Andor — share your concern regarding the situation of the homeless in Europe during this spell of cold weather.</p>
      <p sl="fr">No one could remain unmoved by the situation of people sleeping rough on extremely cold nights and, even more tragically, by the death of many people all over Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You therefore have every right to wonder what is being done to remedy this situation and that is what we can do together faced with what is one of the most extreme and most unacceptable manifestations of social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, the main actors involved in the fight to improve the situation of the homeless …</p>
      <a text="(The President called for silence in the Chamber)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you, Mr President. I was saying that, as we all know, the main actors involved in the situation of the homeless and housing exclusion are the Member States and local actors. Here in Strasbourg, like in other EU cities, local and regional authorities and non-governmental organisations respond to the situation by offering emergency shelter. Local authorities and civil society everywhere are taking the initiative and joining forces.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 2010 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion calls on the Member States to develop and further the development of national, regional or sometimes local action plans to tackle the problem of the homeless, and identifies the areas where action is needed. It is literally vital that the Member States continue in this effort. They are well aware of that and are acting accordingly. I believe that it is very important for Parliament to remind them of this demand by including this urgent debate in the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although the European Union’s capacity for direct action may be limited, we too have a role to play. Firstly, we must remind the Member States of their responsibilities and support them in their efforts. In the longer term, we must improve our understanding of the problems, particularly by improving our instruments for measuring the scale of this phenomenon, which will then make us better able to act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For example, through the PROGRESS programme the European Union is helping to fund a new study on the links between the homeless and migration and is supporting the European Federation of National Organisations working with the Homeless. Furthermore, the Commission is proposing that the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund should respond more efficiently and in a more targeted way to the issue of housing for the homeless in the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European funds must also be used to evaluate and test operational solutions and research new approaches through work on social innovation. We are thinking about housing policy in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My colleague, Commissioner Andor, presented an innovative approach that was launched by railway companies and set in stone, for example, by the European Charter for the development of social and societal innovation in train stations. Thus, the railway companies which are signatories to this Charter declared their intention to share their action programmes in order to contribute to raising corporate awareness of extreme social inclusion at European level. This work has received support from the European initiative for social innovation and experimentation through funding for the recently completed ‘Hope in Stations’ project, which will be extended by the ‘Work in Stations’ project. We want to welcome the establishment of this Charter, which is a positive step at the very time when, as we know, other methods of withdrawal or even stigmatisation are being applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Charter and its ethics illustrate the Commission’s vision of action in the economic and social area. This is a broad vision of social needs, which should take into account the added value and responsibility of all the agreements by the actors and, in particular, the associations and non-governmental organisations which play an exemplary role. Day by day we, the companies, governments, regional and local authorities and civil society representatives are each in our own way giving shape to this social Europe. We are being called up for the battle, which today calls for solidarity with the homeless, as your debate shows.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have taken action but there is still much to be done. The Commission, for its part, is looking to provide the greatest possible support from the Union for the Member States’ efforts on this issue of the homeless. We are relying particularly on Parliament’s work as laid out in its resolution of 14 September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, honourable Members, with the initiative for social entrepreneurship, which was published in October and which I, for my part, have been following very closely, the Commission proposed new tools, which should allow social enterprises to better carry out their mission and we know that some of these social enterprises are involved with the homeless, especially when they aim to respond to the needs of vulnerable people, as is the case of the homeless.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to cite three examples: better signposting of Structural Funds, simplified rules and fewer controls on State aid intended for social services for vulnerable people and, lastly, public contract rules which lessen obligations for social services and allow certain markets to be more easily preserved or reserved for start-up companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is all I can say on behalf of Commissioner Andor and I thank you, Mr President, honourable Members, for turning your attention to this issue, which is extremely serious at this time.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Before I open the debate, I need to point something out. Quite a few Members have put themselves down for the catch-the-eye procedure. I have to tell you that the agenda states that there will only be a round of speakers for the groups. I am sorry, therefore, but I will not be presiding over a catch-the-eye procedure.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as we speak, more than 600 people have died in Europe, victims of the cold and, above all, isolation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is an opportunity to remember that Europe is not just about economics and finance. It is first and foremost about solidarity, and the spell of cold weather affecting our people is an opportunity for us to prove it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet what are we seeing? Food supplies for European food aid programmes are at their lowest and here we have called for help for the NGOs in charge of them. Some EU countries have taken these programmes hostage and have only renewed them until 2013, using legal problems as an excuse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also seeing that not enough is being done in response to the real scandal of food waste. I am referring here to all that is being thrown away by major supermarket chains every day when we all know that there are organisations that do not have enough food to hand out at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is high time that we reacted by putting our support networks into action. Having been mayor of a village for many years, I know that it is at local level that things first play out and I welcome the informal assistance networks that have sprung up over the last few weeks. These are the most effective networks and these are the ones we must support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also react by extending the European food aid programme. It is also high time that we promoted a common energy policy. What, then, are the facts? Today, people in need are having their gas and electricity cut off because they cannot pay their bills. Yet we are reacting much too slowly in all our countries. Here too, we must call for help.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Mr Barnier, we must update the basic European civil protection project that we are so desperately lacking. We must act to stop the same tragedies and the same emergencies from happening again year after year. We have experienced them and we must be prepared. We must provide our NGOs and our fellow citizens who are dealing with these issues with the necessary means to do so rather than passing them over to large organisations.</p>

    <intervention id="1-034-000" speaker_id="96952" name="Sylvie GUILLAUME" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group" nationality="France" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the spell of cold weather that has hit Europe over the last few weeks has already caused several hundred deaths, mostly among the homeless. However, while these winter deaths are today provoking strong reactions in public opinion, we are well aware that in summer too there are just as many if not more victims of this unacceptable insecurity. For, yes, the cold kills. Yet, aside from the cold, the economic crisis, poverty and insecurity are killing the most excluded people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are over three million homeless people in the EU, and these include not only the traditional figures of the very marginalised but also more and more senior citizens, young people, women and families. Sometimes there are workers among the homeless. Let us remember that, in times of economic crisis, the fall into extreme insecurity can happen very quickly. A family breakdown or a redundancy can be all it takes for a family, who until then had been coping, to be thrown onto the streets. Moreover, being homeless can cover a number of situations which must also be understood. These are all the people who sleep in their cars, in hotels or those who are temporarily able to stay with a friend or relative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must change our collective view of homelessness as this issue covers a wide range of people and situations. They all call for a comprehensive, fast and strong political response. We must act, not only to alleviate the emergency, but especially in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If recovering from the crisis is the main objective, providing the homeless with emergency provisions and the means to come off the streets will help towards this. For it is obvious that, without permanent access to affordable housing, the homeless find themselves excluded from various other rights and services. Indignation at this situation, as well as an analysis of it, will be shared without difficulty. Let us move on once and for all to the next stage: political will.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, Parliament has already asked you several times to put in place a true European strategy against homelessness. I am referring to the 2010 written declaration and the resolution by our colleagues Mr Berès and Ms Delli adopted here in September 2011 with a view to putting an end to homelessness by 2015. This was also the ambitious integrated European strategy that we were waiting for. I am also referring to the resolution by Mr Daerden in November on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, the Members of the European Parliament have already asked you three times to put in place this strategy for the homeless, which was articulated around specific objectives which I do not have the time to repeat again here. Where are we with this road jmap? When is the Commission going to demand real national strategies accompanied by real means from the Member States? What amount of ESF and ERDF money could be mobilised? Today, our fear is that the European platform against poverty and social exclusion will remain a mere declaration of intent. Just like that of the same name in 2010, which, unfortunately, will not have delivered many concrete results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The political objectives and priorities of the EU brought together in the Europe 2020 strategy are undergoing inclusive growth. Yet how are we to build true social cohesion if we do not fight against these situations of extreme insecurity? This is an issue which cannot be delegated to the goodwill and limited means of associations and local communities. It is no longer acceptable that, in times of crisis, the European Union appears only as an instigator of austerity plans that push people onto the streets both literally and figuratively.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It would be easy to accuse the EU of wanting to save only the banks while abandoning the people, but I refuse to do so. Here we have the perfect opportunity to fight against this caricature. We must seize this opportunity and not be content with mere declarations of intent. There is little point in claiming to be fiercely opposed to the situation of the homeless. It is easy to be indignant about such an issue. There is, however, a great deal to be done and that is why we are asking once again for concrete voluntary action in favour of homeless people.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, to be perhaps a little provocative, we could have opened this sitting with a minute’s silence in memory of the more than 600 homeless people who have died this week from the cold. This is the tribute that we generally reserve for great and famous people. That would have represented an assumption of responsibility – perhaps the first by this Parliament – of great symbolic significance.</p>
      <p sl="it">In fact, what we are witnessing is that the instruments of participatory democracy for the defence of rights provided by the Union are incapable of being applied to the homeless, whether or not they are citizens of the European Union, and this is because, I am afraid, there is often no electoral consensus for this.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Vice-President, Mr Barnier, is quite right to remind us that this is a matter within the competence, above all, of the Member States. However, we are dealing here with a phenomenon that is ever more European, cross-border and visible. We therefore ask: what is the timetable for the strategy that we have demanded from the Commission on a number of occasions? How much – aside from the Progress programme – can be allocated from European funds, including the structural and social cohesion funds? We ask in addition: is free movement for the homeless genuinely guaranteed, or is it possible for a Member State to impose restrictions, precisely because these citizens –European citizens – may not have a fixed place of abode at their disposal?</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, are basic support services guaranteed? Some Member States have refused this to citizens of other Member States, citing European regulations. Are we sure that this is legally admissible?</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has established that every European citizen wastes 179 kilograms of food per year. What European strategy should we adopt to combat this waste? I consider that this is an economic and social issue but above all one of the identity of our own European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, I am angry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here we are two years after the consensus conference rightly piloted a European strategy for the homeless under the Belgian Presidency. The European Parliament drafted a written declaration in favour of the homeless. No response. I drafted the resolution in favour of a European strategy for the homeless. The Commission did not respond to our request, which remains a dead letter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am sorry that today there is no one on the Council’s bench, while it is the Member States’ responsibility to ensure the right to housing assistance for all those who do not have sufficient resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In two weeks, the spell of very cold weather has killed over 600 people; this has already been said. I say it time and again: the homeless do not only die in winter. All year round they sleep on the streets and all year round they have their rights trampled on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European citizens expect more from the European Union today. It must be united and active faced with the distress of the most vulnerable people. The situation is more than worrying. I will give you a few examples. In Greece, the number of homeless people has increased by 25% in two years. In Hungary, the homeless are persecuted by the police and threatened with heavy fines. In France, we are seeing decrees which criminalise begging and stealing food from bins.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where is this headed?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are seeing it more and more: austerity policies led by the governments will have disastrous consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, let us demand a shake-up, a wake-up call. We can change things. I will say it very clearly, Commissioner; the European Union must play its part for solidarity between the Member States and the European people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must urgently bring together the ministers concerned. The time for saving the banks is over. It is now time to save lives. We have already waited too long. Each Member State must make the Commission aware of the measures it has put in place since the cold spell began. We must mobilise an emergency fund immediately to come to the aid of the most vulnerable people. The Member States which do not respect their obligation to provide emergency assistance to the most impoverished must be sanctioned, particularly those which criminalise the homeless or prohibit access to emergency shelters for certain groups of people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Mr Barnier, the Commission must put in place a European strategy for the homeless immediately. The aim is clear; we have discussed it here; ladies and gentlemen, no one should be sleeping on the streets by 2015. This is an emergency. In order to dream, you must have somewhere to sleep. If we let it, this glacial silence from European representatives will lead to distrust among the citizens. You really need to react …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ultimately every society is judged by how it treats its vulnerable and its old.</p>
      <p sl="en">We currently have approximately 3 million people who have no fixed abode in Europe. I find that in my own Member State, the United Kingdom, hypothermia cases amongst the elderly have doubled in the last five years. Such is the extent of the problem that it was no surprise to me today when I picked up a leading newspaper in the United Kingdom and the headline was: ‘Frozen to death as fuel bills soar’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some may argue that this is about homeless people. Well, yes it is, but my argument is that, whilst we should have a strategy in order to deal with the homeless situation and those people affected by the severe weather who are homeless, we must, equally, have a measure in place to deal with those people who could find themselves in a situation of homelessness through not being able to afford a place to live, in view of the current pressures that they have financially.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are finding, right across the European Union, that redundancies are rising and repossessions are rising. I have a figure of 233 homeless people dead within the last seven days. Mr Daul quotes a figure in excess of 600 over the past few weeks. This is a matter of real and great shame for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Barnier talks about the restricted role of this House. Yes, it is right, we must firm up the role of our Member States and we must ensure that there is coordination and sharing of best practice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the spell of cold weather is bringing to light the deplorable failures in the way human rights are safeguarded in Europe and within the European Union. The policies of the Member States and of the European Union have failed across the board where this issue is concerned. More than 600 people have died so far during the spell of cold weather that is moving across the whole of Europe. There have been over 80 deaths in Poland, more than 130 in Ukraine, hundreds have died in Russia, and the first victims have also been claimed in Germany. Most of the people who freeze to death or are taken to hospital severely ill from the cold are homeless people; people who, for one reason or another, are living on the streets. They are freezing to death in the open air, under bridges, in parks, in side streets, but increasingly also in unheated homes. With the huge increases in energy costs – for heating oil, for example – they may have been unable to pay their energy bills, or their heating may be antiquated or may have failed completely. All the Member States have an obligation to implement urgent immediate measures to save people who have no protection from the cold. Local and regional authorities need to be supported in their efforts to provide the necessary assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">I find it appalling that, at the moment, no one can say exactly how many homeless people there are at present in the European Union; how many people are at risk of freezing to death. Within the European Union there are no common indicators, no statistics clarifying the actual extent of the problem – not even in Germany. We call for a task force to be set up at the European Commission to shed a clear light on those in urgent need, on those who are particularly affected in the individual regions, so that immediate assistance can also be organised. We call for uniform statistics across the EU; indicators that can provide a complete, differentiated picture of the extent of homelessness and tell us the different population groups affected. The Member States must arrange for legislation to be passed to this effect. We also call for EU-wide programmes to be set up for the modernisation of home energy. The possibilities for this under the Structural Funds need to be broadened considerably. We also propose a debate on EU-wide social and ecological minimum standards to combat poverty, housing shortages and energy poverty.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Rinaldi and Ms Delli just now have reminded us of the deaths of 600 people in the last few days and weeks in our various European countries and it is good that we are paying tribute to them, Mr Rinaldi, as this is a good indicator of both the scale and the European nature of this tragedy. That is why I will say it again, on behalf of the European Commission, that it is good, that it is normal and that it is necessary for Parliament and the Commission, which is entering into dialogue with you, to take stock of this situation and respond to it in a number of ways.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also want to say — this is not necessarily a good answer, Ms Guillaume — that, as you know, the main responsibility lies with the Member States. The first requirement of a debate such as this one is that we act in conjunction with the Member States so that they assume this responsibility both in their own countries and throughout the EU and that is the role of Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Daul mentioned the debate in which we participated, along with my colleague Dacian Cioloş, on the food aid programme. Why have we been deadlocked on this programme, which directly concerns support for the most fragile people through so many of the associations to which Mr Daul rightly paid tribute and which are not all very large associations but local associations which do excellent work?</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is it that we are coming up against, honourable Members? We are coming up against some Member States’ feelings or their understanding of national competences, indeed sometimes regional competences, saying that it is not up to Brussels to worry about the action programme or food aid. Thanks to your determination and thanks to the work of my colleague Mr Cioloş, we have managed to convince the Council of Ministers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, Ms Guillaume, I recognise that it is not an ideal response to refer back to national competences. We have the ability … Mr Karim just this minute, Mr Daul and Ms Zimmer mentioned an issue which interests me and which I feel committed about and it is what I call ‘universal services’: basic services for people, be they related to housing, food or energy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union can indirectly act in this area by using its laws and regulations to promote the actions of those who are on to the ground and the men and women who are suffering. I would like to give you one or two examples in which I was personally involved. I presented you with the overhaul of the rules governing public procurement, which is now being debated in your committees, and my colleague Mr Almunia and I revised the rules governing State aid and, if you look closely at these texts, which have been under discussion in Parliament and in the Council for several weeks, you will find very specific measures for promoting social inclusion and basic social services through public procurement and facilitating social services through State aid. This is another way in which the European Union can make itself useful and play its part.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Guillaume and Ms Delli mentioned the strategy for the homeless that you had been calling for so earnestly throughout this conference and the September 2011 resolution. I also said, in response to Mr Rinaldi, that the Commission — and this is a message that Mr Andor asked me to deliver to you — has taken a number of measures and taken into consideration a number of recommendations made by you. These include a study on mobility, migration, expropriations, a transnational project on housing strategies which will be supported within the framework of the work on social innovation, earmarking European Funds, as I mentioned, specifically for housing with the European Regional Development Fund or other social funds. The figures I have seen are only figures but they are quite clear: the Member States dedicated EUR 10 billion from the European Social Fund for the 2007–2013 period to tackling social exclusion in aid of the most deprived and most vulnerable people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to tell Ms Delli that we share her feelings regarding what is happening with the unacceptable criminalisation of the homeless in some Member States. We have seen attacks against the homeless in other Member States and we, alongside you, are calling on the Member States to accept their responsibilities to put an end to such practices.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to tell Mr Daul that I have taken note of his call for European civil protection. This is an issue — as he knows — which is very important to me. My colleague, Ms Georgieva, is very involved in this issue. We have made concrete proposals to arrive at what I hope will one day be a European civil protection force to respond to disasters outside the EU, but also, Mr Daul, to act as needed when all European countries are affected by problems which impact on the most vulnerable people and which put the health or safety of some of our fellow citizens in danger.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think it is good that the European Parliament has, even briefly, acted on its own initiative, together with the Commission, to address this situation with our legal, financial and political tools. I believe that, in the serious crisis that we are currently experiencing — and this is one of the reasons why there are so many homeless people on the streets at the moment, due to unemployment, as Ms Guillaume rightly said — there is a European dimension to this issue even though the competences are not necessarily European. That is why, in its own place and with the means available to it, such as the ability to drive through legislation and mobilise funds, Parliament, and with it the European Commission, will continue to give a legitimate, justified European dimension to the issue of the homeless.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, intellectual property infringements seem like a game, but they are destroying the game. They make it impossible to compete freely and fairly, and they allow the players who cheat most to win, that is, the players who do not respect the rules, do not pay their taxes, and who do not protect the rights of either their workers or their customers.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this report, we got beyond the term ‘piracy’ once and for all. We feel that the term ‘piracy’ is mistaken, because we do not really see that it has any relation with boarding ships at sea, or with the mythical legends of pirates. The infringers themselves have even sometimes waved this term as a flag to pass themselves off as freedom fighters. However, their battle is in vain because they end up serving the interests of large multinationals that want access to content without having to pay for it. Let us call infringements what they really are: infringements. Let us call a spade a spade.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Observatory in Alicante, where the Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office is already operating successfully, will make the true figures, which are not so evident to everybody, plain to see. The Observatory will make proposals and, above all, provide information on the situation in the sector and compliance with regulations. The text also includes an additional data protection guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the Observatory will act as a meeting point between the public and private sectors, proper representation of all the actors involved will be crucial. That is why I have insisted on including the creative industries, primarily to take account of the employment aspect, as well as an annual evaluation in the management report to assess whether the players involved are represented in a well-balanced way.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Observatory will undoubtedly play a very important role in the essential monitoring work to ensure respect for intellectual property rights.</p>

    <intervention id="1-046-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, firstly I should like to personally and warmly thank Mr Masip Hidalgo for the remarkable work he has done on this regulation and for the role he played personally in the agreement reached with the Council a few days ago on 19 December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to praise the efforts of other Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs, particularly the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Ms Verheyen and Mr Bielan. All of these efforts, and others which I cannot mention, have allowed us to reach a fair and positive compromise for which I would like to voice my agreement, Mr Hidalgo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to express my gratitude to the Polish Presidency for supporting this matter until it was approved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, as the rapporteur, Mr Hidalgo, said, the protection of intellectual property is very important to me. It is an important issue for our economy. It is a major challenge, which we must overcome together for the sake of competitiveness. It is only natural that intellectual property and the defence of intellectual property should be an issue now rather than during the last century. This is, of course, the age of the Internet. It is also the age of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I launched a broad action plan on 24 May to modernise the rules currently governing the protection of intellectual property in Europe. The creation of this European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights — that is what it shall be called, Mr Hidalgo, as Parliament wanted, ‘the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights’, and I approve of this name — is a key initiative in this direction. It is, moreover, the first legislative initiative of this action plan. The Observatory will be one of the cornerstones of our common fight against these infringements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The creation of this Observatory represents two important advances: firstly, it will be a forum for technical experts from the public and private sectors to exchange information and experiences and, secondly, it will improve our ability to obtain reliable data on the real impact of these infringements on the economy and jobs in Europe. It is important that we fully understand what we are dealing with in order to react appropriately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to thank Parliament for its support for our proposal in the negotiations with the Council, particularly in terms of ensuring that the Member States provide the Observatory with information and data. Thanks to the agreement which has been concluded, the Observatory will now become fully operational within the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, honourable Members, this will not mark the end of all our efforts and our cooperation. My services will stay fully involved in all of the Observatory’s activities, in a spirit of cooperation with the Office.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the Commission will be one of the main beneficiaries of the services provided by the Observatory thanks to the increased credibility and objectivity of the data it will collect. The regulation will also give the Commission the opportunity to ask the Office to publish recommendations in the areas covered by the Observatory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope, honourable Members, that Parliament will stay very closely involved in the work of the Observatory, as we proposed, as you requested and as I recalled just last Friday afternoon, Mr Hidalgo, when I found myself spending the day in Alicante to meet the 1 200 people who work at the Office of Trade Marks and Designs. They do remarkable and extremely modern work and it is in Alicante, thanks to you and thanks to this agreement, that the work of this Observatory that we are establishing thanks to your decision and your work, will receive financial and technical support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wanted to thank you most sincerely for this. It is very important, honourable Members, that we have a good understanding of these phenomena and these infringements so that we may act appropriately and not in the wrong way. It is now the tool that we will put in place, which is starting to be put in place, and which will be possible thanks to you.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal being debated gives the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market the task of running the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Privacy. My opinion is that the idea is very practical in approach and is viable for that reason. The office has the necessary infrastructure and professional background to perform effectively the new tasks assigned to the observatory.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The report changed the name of the observatory to the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights. The new name reflects the wide-ranging tasks and coordinating role assigned to the observatory. It is well known that counterfeiting causes considerable damage not only to the internal market and national economies, but also to citizens of the European Union directly. It is precisely for that reason that the Member States need to develop law enforcement strategies together and regularly exchange best practices. From now on the observatory will be the platform for that.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The committee’s report is balanced. My colleagues and I strived to ensure that the text of the regulation considers all aspects of the effective operation of the observatory. It is not by chance that it refers to the special situation of small- and medium-sized enterprises and the representation of cultural and creative sectors. We likewise regarded effective relations between the national authorities, the private sector and the institutions of the European Union as important. In order for citizens to become aware of the negative impacts of counterfeiting too, the observatory needs keep its partners across Europe suitably informed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Member States need to do the same in reverse. Raising awareness of the social and economic damage caused by infringements of rights could make it easier to ensure that rights are respected and to enforce the law. We can rightly trust that a well structured observatory with the appropriate legal background will be able to perform its work effectively.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, intellectual property rights could be described as one of the pillars of the European knowledge society. Intellectual property is one of Europe’s most important resources. It is quite clear, therefore, that these rights need to be adequately defended and protected from counterfeiting and imitation, from piracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the reason why the European Commission tabled its proposal to combine the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, which was set up in 2009, with the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market was to ensure protection in Europe from counterfeiting and product piracy. The idea behind this – to encourage better coordination between the authorities involved in enforcement of intellectual property rights – can only be a good thing in administrative terms, and will simplify the prosecution of crimes in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, Commissioner, I would like to pass on a few thoughts to you. At present, we Members of the European Parliament are receiving emails, enquiries from citizens, phone calls and personal contacts regarding ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement with which everyone is familiar. Citizens in all the Member States fear this as an attack on their personal data, and they fear that mass surveillance is becoming a reality. Europe was and is a defender of fundamental rights and citizens’ rights, and points the way for other countries in the international community, and that must remain the case in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">It appears that in future this Observatory will also be dealing with matters that are covered by ACTA. I would therefore ask you to bear in mind that the Commission must ensure that European citizens have unrestricted and secure Internet access. Moreover, the Office must support the authorities in the Member States and not take action itself – that has been expressly clarified, although the Commission proposal leaves the matter open. Finally, and very importantly, the relevant representatives of civil society, particularly consumer representatives, Internet protagonists, users and independent actors – in other words, all those who play an important role in the 21st century – would like to be involved in its consultations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the main problem with intellectual property policy, both at EU level and in most of the Member States, is that it is almost completely based on what industry lobbyists are claiming, which is founded on very little proper research.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are very many reports on intellectual property that have been compiled by the lobbyists basically taking one big number out of thin air, multiplying it by another big number and saying: ‘Wow, we lose this amount of money’ (or jobs, or whatever).</p>
      <p sl="en">One prime example of such a report is the terrorism report, which was actually mentioned in the Commission’s communication on this observatory. So I am very concerned about this observatory, but many people – including people from the OHIM – have said ‘No, the observatory will start collecting proper academic research’. If that actually is the case, I think it would be extremely valuable, because there is a lot of very good academic research showing that the issue of intellectual property and intellectual property infringements is not necessarily as simple as the lobbyists are saying, far from it.</p>
      <p sl="en">To give the proposal the benefit of the doubt – despite my misgivings about it – hopefully the observatory can be something good if it really focuses on proper academic research. For that reason, I will be abstaining rather than voting against this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I start off by thanking Mr Masip Hidalgo for the very comprehensive way in which he has dealt with this matter and the very cooperative fashion in which he has dealt with all colleagues who have been engaged with him.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of all the briefs that I have been involved with since I have been in this Parliament, by far the biggest challenge for me has been the whole intellectual property debate, and the biggest part of the challenge has been trying to keep up with the game, because by the time we have legislated and moved to where we feel we need to be at, the whole agenda seems to have moved on. Therefore it is absolutely essential that we have a body like this in place that is able to advise us and give us guidance as to where we need to be moving next.</p>
      <p sl="en">Along with that, politically, I believe there is a need, across this House and in the European Union generally, to have a greater understanding of the value of IP rights and ensure that this is culturally and economically properly understood in Europe, because we have a huge amount at stake. One only needs to look to see how, economically, we need to grow at this moment at time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where is that growth going to come from? Well, a big part of our growth agenda can be fulfilled from the potentials that we have in innovation and what our thinkers right across the European Union are doing in the creative industries. Just to quote from one report, across the G20 nations, the internet economy amounted to 4.1% of GDP or USD 2.3 trillion in 2010. That is larger than the economies of Italy or Brazil. In other leading economies it contributed 8% of GDP, powering growth economically and creating jobs. By 2016, we expect there to be 3 billion internet users globally and the internet economy will reach USD 4.2 trillion in the G20 nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore need to make sure that we have the correct policy portfolio in place so that we are able to exploit this new and expanding market, and that the Observatory is well placed to be able to assist us to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certainly, from my Group’s perspective, we were at the forefront of ensuring that SMEs play their part in this and that their interests are protected fully as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is essentially a commercial problem, and if action is needed, then it is a situation crying out to be addressed by the private sector acting in its own commercial interests, under the law. But instead we get this report, which has all the hallmarks of everything which is worst about the EU and the Commission in particular, because it is going to be done using taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thought there was a crisis on. I thought we were living in a time of austerity necessitated by excessive government debt but, as ever, the taxpayer will be required to provide money that he or she can ill afford. The Commission likes to pretend that this will not require any extra resources, but I am more likely to believe that a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. We are creating and extending a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies always set out to justify themselves by showing both the massive scale of the problem and the need for more complex solutions. You can see it in this report and in the proposed legislation. It states facts which can only be conjecture. It is telling that you cannot be precise, or even necessarily in the right ballpark, when assessing grey economic activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not see any proof that this new extension of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will either save EUR 10 billion or 185 000 jobs, yet that is the claim. To paraphrase Mandy Rice-Davies, ‘they would say that, wouldn’t they?’ Before I could back any of the proposals such as this, I would require some kind of guarantee that this would work and save the taxpayer money. I do not want to be unkind, but is it not nice for the office to be put in Alicante? You would think that an office like this would be put in an established commercial centre or a place associated with innovation, entrepreneurship and growth, but it is placed on the Costa Blanca. It reminds me of the famous song ‘Oh we do like to live beside the seaside, oh we do like to live beside the sea’ because – come on, let us get real – we are once again seeing taxpayers’ money being thrown at ‘jobs for the boys’ corporatism. Where is the evidence for European consumers and taxpayers that they will be better off? That would be a real impact assessment, not the usual Commission approach of assuming what it seeks to prove.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we have here is the usual manifestation of the Commission’s proposals, because it will be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It will never, ever, be brought in at a saving to the taxpayer. It will become eventually, as all these things always do, another bureaucratic monster. It is no more than a proto-agency right now but, as ever, it will grow and it will grow. I predict that, sitting there by the Costa Brava beach, the office and its lucky bureaucrats will become bloated on sun, sangria and paella.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo on the work he has done, which recognises the key role played by the defence of intellectual property rights as an indispensable instrument for economic growth in the European Union, in that it creates jobs and protects cultural diversity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Infringements of intellectual property rights effectively do enormous damage to Union revenues and it is essential to strengthen our efforts to combat unlawful acts through collaboration between national authorities, European Union institutions and industry experts.</p>
      <p sl="it">The adoption of this measure answers this need and enables us to lay the foundation for creating a single market for intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Embedding the Observatory within the European Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will in fact ensure that it has the human, financial and logistical resources it needs in order to carry out its task in an effective manner.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are at the start of a long journey, during which we shall have to monitor and evaluate the Observatory’s activities with close and careful attention.</p>
      <p sl="it">Infringement of intellectual property rights in fact occurs on many levels, requiring different degrees of protection and recognition by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">It will be essential to continue to make use of the expertise of national authorities and the many specific representative organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">This will enable us to strengthen the technical skills of the Observatory, thereby simultaneously ensuring that every intellectual property right is recognised at the EU level without any hierarchical ordering of the level of protection and recognition.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, since 1996 the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in Alicante has been the official body for the registration of EU trade marks and, since 2003, for registered EU designs. There has been a complete and well-functioning harmonisation in this regard in all Member States. One measure of this body’s success is the fact that last year alone it received over 98 000 trade mark applications and almost 82 000 designs, which testifies to the increasing importance of protection at European Union level. This growing trust in OHIM means that it now seems appropriate to extend its scope of activity, in accordance with EU law of course and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights which guarantees respect for all citizens’ freedoms as well as due protection for personal data.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The recent noisy demonstrations against the ACTA agreement have shown that excessively secret negotiations are not acceptable to our citizens. I hope that the new observatory in Alicante will function in a transparent manner for the good of citizens and not under the pressure of lobbyists from large corporations. Finally, I would like to extend sincere congratulations to the rapporteur for a task that was very well done.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, in 2009 the European Parliament resolved to set up a European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy in order to capture reliable objective data on the actual number of counterfeit and imitation products, rather than being solely reliant on the data made available by producers and the trade. The Observatory, which in the end only commenced operations in 2010, was a complete success. It has become a centre of excellence, collecting information and data on all the counterfeit products – such as drugs, toys and car parts – that threaten the lives and health of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">This Observatory, which was co-managed by the Commission – the bottom line is that it was actually only co-managed – now needs to be restructured, and given additional human and other resources to deal with the increase in its tasks. To bring this about, we have decided – for reasons of costs and efficiency – not to establish a new agency, but to utilise an existing agency and, in effect, to transfer the Observatory’s tasks to the existing agency, the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in Alicante. This agency in fact employs 650 people, and they are already responsible for the registration of Community trade marks and designs.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I therefore explicitly repeat to the Member from the United Kingdom – who has, unfortunately, already left – that this Office is therefore able to work on a cost-neutral basis, because it finances itself from the fees received for the said trade marks; in other words, we are merely imposing additional tasks on an existing agency and are benefiting from the agreement on fees. I would also like to repeat that analysis of the problem of data theft is mentioned only in the recitals, and that it is stated there that the Observatory will primarily deal with counterfeiting and product piracy.</p>

He has attended here today with a prepared script, has not once attended the committee, has not once made a single statement in committee and has not moved a single amendment by either himself or anybody in his delegation or in his Group.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Masip for having genuinely allowed a very open debate to take place on this report and for having also incorporated some of the suggestions made by the other shadow rapporteurs, which I consider very important.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is quite clear that intellectual property rights infringements involving counterfeit goods are a serious problem. I believe, however, that we cannot overcome this merely by concentrating on penalties and enforcement. We need to choose new, different strategies here if we are to be able to make a really clear response. For me, the most important thing is that the methodology chosen by this Observatory is reliable; that we get reliable data, with the involvement of civil society; and that new business models and data protection issues are taken into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to this report, the old strategies are not working. We need to recognise that, and it is something that I see as a problem. Fortunately, the wording has been improved. We will be monitoring things closely to see whether practice will also improve, because I really cannot see any sign of that at present.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we are discussing the European Observatory, which will help to provide independent data and facilitate the exchange of good practice in the very real area of counterfeiting and piracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I am glad to see that the initial proposal from the Commission has undergone a number of changes within Parliament and the Council, especially when it comes to the governance model. The Member States forming part of the Administrative Board are important to the governance structure and their oversight is legitimising the work, as the Office should be policy-informing instead of policy-leading.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the European Observatory, as there has been a lack of independent data and harmonised activity across the EU in the area of counterfeiting and piracy. The collection of data in this area will be increasingly important as a source of evidence to inform the debate on copyright infringement and IPR abuse.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we do not want to see a duplication of effort in protecting IPR. The Office should be taking into account the existing information obligations on Member States relating to intellectual property infringements.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I have been following the opinion on this report, which I also finally supported. The Committee on Culture’s opinion called for more recognition of the cultural dimension of IPR, and stressed the importance of people from the cultural and creative sectors participating in meetings of the Observatory.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have submitted amendments that will allow the Observatory to focus on all types of IPR infringements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important issue is to have the Office support the activities of national authorities as well as private industry, but it should provide observations, not strict recommendations to Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am indeed relieved that we, in these difficult financial times, are able to save the taxpayers money by efficient use of financial and human resources and at no cost to the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the governance model in the final proposal being much more satisfactory, and the description of the tasks and responsibilities of the Observatory now being more concrete, I am now happy to vote in favour of the final report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to start by congratulating Mr Masip Hidalgo and the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why is this legislative initiative so important? It is important because, at the moment, some political leaders and some Members of Parliament are still not convinced of the need to provide effective protection for intellectual property rights. However, it has been proven that infringements of intellectual property rights have disastrous economic consequences for companies and for employment. Yet the detailed studies showing this have been criticised. Their impartiality has been called into question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, by calling on experts and interested parties who represent various sectors and a wide range of interests, the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights will work with transparency and provide objective, reliable, relevant and comparable data on the value of intellectual property rights and infringements of these rights. Its forum will allow for exchanges of views and discussion on new economic models to encourage the development of the legal offer. I truly believe that this change marks a fundamental step towards helping national authorities and the private sector to protect European creativity, innovation and know-how in the internal market and abroad.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I am quite capable of answering this question since so-called ‘civil society’ will be brought in to be consulted, to participate in the discussion forum and to give their views. Therefore, small and medium-sized enterprises will obviously be involved and they will have every opportunity to make their voices heard. We cannot show mistrust for this tool, which is nevertheless an excellent technical tool, before it is even put in place. On the contrary, we must believe in it and join forces to make it work as best we can.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, a harmonised, progressive approach to intellectual property rights is vital to fulfilling the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including the Digital Agenda for Europe. The Office provides a forum that brings together public authorities and representatives of the private sector, ensuring the collection, analysis and dissemination of objective, comparable and reliable data concerning the value of intellectual property rights and the infringements of those rights, identifying and promoting best practices and strategies to ensure respect for intellectual property rights, and raising public awareness of the impact of intellectual property right infringements.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Parliament considers that respect for citizens’ fundamental rights and freedoms is essential. Measures aimed at protecting intellectual property must not infringe citizens’ fundamental rights and freedoms. European legislation, through the Telecoms package, bans service providers from filtering Internet content unless authorisation to do so is granted by a judge. The Observatory must only support and be restricted to implementing specific European legislation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to mention that I think that, with the agreement we have reached here on the basis of the Commission proposal, we will be able to take a significant step forward in informing young people of the consequences that product piracy and the buying of counterfeit products have for their health, but also for the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this connection may I remind you of the very positive initiative to create a European prize taken by the European trade mark office following the establishment of this Observatory; a prize for the best ideas from young people as to how we can communicate more effectively the negative consequences that product piracy or the buying of counterfeit products can have.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Masip Hidalgo was with me last week in Brussels – as were you, Commissioner – when we were able to present some really excellent short films which, in very simple language and without automatically engaging in moral criticism, shed light on the problems that product piracy and counterfeit products cause for European industry. These have also been awarded prizes by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that, despite all the different views represented in this House where the detail is concerned, we are all united in the view that we need a better, more understandable, more communicative strategy for showing young people in particular what the abuse of the possibilities offered by the Internet can mean in the final event for the European economy, and for their parents’ jobs. We still need more campaigns on this. We are definitely on the right path – but I believe, Commissioner, we should try to consolidate this path; we should not just give out awards for really good ideas, but also incorporate such ideas into European political communications.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it would be a great contribution if the European Parliament were to award one of these short clips the LUX Prize that we give out each year for excellence in European film, so that reference is made to the negative consequences of product piracy even in the opening credits of the film.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ensuring uniform market protection of intellectual property rights at the appropriate level is of key importance to the economy of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">On the other hand, we must not fall into the trap of overregulation, which, as we can see in the case of ACTA for example, can give rise to anxiety, speculation and at times even hysteria. Progress depends in part on new ideas and new knowledge.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, issues of intellectual property protection have recently become highly politicised, and have come to the forefront of public interest due to the disputed ACTA agreement. On this occasion, I would like to raise the question of whether the current patent protection is the most effective and the fairest possible. I would like to mention in particular the patent law that allows pharmaceutical companies to sell drugs for fatal diseases at a high price. Moreover, under the threat of sanctions, they can prevent the production and sale of far cheaper generic drugs. Technically, therefore, it is not a problem to prevent the death of people, but legally it is impossible, because the pharmaceutical corporations do not want to give up their profits from sales and are preventing the attainment of what is technically possible. The existence of the patent in its present form thus leads directly to the needless death and suffering of many people.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, intellectual property in any form is an important issue at EU level. According to the studies conducted, piracy makes companies less motivated to be innovative, which has an impact on the number of jobs and poses a risk to our citizens’ health. Counterfeiting does not only affect luxury items, but also items of everyday use, including medicines and food. Indeed, the extent of the problem requires a coordinated approach to the relevant policies at EU level. Another requirement is cooperation with third countries and the development of technical assistance programmes targeting new counterfeiting methods.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to highlight the differentiation which we need to make between piracy and personal use, while also informing the public about the multiple impact caused by the infringement of intellectual property rights. The transparency of the decisions made by the Office for …</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I think that the amendment being tabled is ideal in light of the budgetary constraints of the European institutional system. Merging the powers of the Office with those of the Observatory means a higher profile for external decision-makers. I support the proposal for ensuring the transparency of every procedure involved in the operation of this mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also support the exchange of good practices by SMEs on intellectual property rights management. Amendment 6 of the report is relevant, as a structure set up in this way can support the development of the new business models. Diversification of activities must be accompanied by suitable protection for the intellectual property rights used. This is why Member States, the Commission and Office need to be in permanent communication with each other. At the same time, European citizens must be kept informed and be actively involved in the operation of the Office.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to ask Commissioner Barnier about the situation as regards brand equity. The term is always being bandied about by big business, but it is something that is of particular importance for exports by small and medium-sized enterprises on the international stage. Can you envisage that in future this Office might also determine the costs of intellectual property, at a global level, and that this transparency comparison will then also show the position in Europe and whether individual artists who assert their copyright here can afford to get this international protection?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am grateful to each and every one of you for your speeches and your support, even if there are some legitimate questions and reservations about this observatory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I should like to confirm to Ms Regner and Mr Engström that, following an amendment by Mr Masip Hidalgo (Amendment 31), civil society will have a role to play in the functioning of this observatory and this role is well recognised in the final text. This is one of the improvements — I call it as I see it — which was made by Parliament to the Commission’s initial text. As Ms McClarkin recalled, the text has been improved and I wanted to thank you for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to tell Ms Geringer and Ms Lichtenberger that the work of the Observatory is getting underway. I can confirm this; I was in Alicante all day on Friday, where I met the small team which is getting this work underway with a great deal of skill, independence and professionalism and which will gain in power. I think I can say, Mr Engström, with my thanks for your objective expectations regarding the work of this observatory, that the methodology will be reliable and the work will be objective and transparent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to tell Ms McClarkin that, thanks to Amendment 13, which was tabled, we will avoid any duplication. The office in Alicante already works with national regulators — I was there on Friday while a meeting was taking place with all of the representatives from the national regulators who work with the Alicante office — and this office will allow us to facilitate this work and avoid duplication with national supervisors and therefore ensure that the European office (with the European Observatory) works well and works intelligently with national supervisors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to thank Mr Mészáros for his support. I should like to tell Ms Gallo and Mr Engström that this work is very important. We are taking great care to deal with it objectively and credibly. We are dealing with it in positive way; I also spoke about this with Mr Campinos, the very dynamic President of the Trade Marks Office in Alicante. It is a question of giving an objective, concrete and reliable representation of what intellectual property means for the economy, growth and jobs and to do so in a positive and entirely credible way. A number of economic studies will therefore be carried out on precisely what the development of intellectual property means for economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not about criminalising — Mr Engström, you will remember that in a public committee debate I told you that it was not my intention to criminalise or point the finger at young people — but, first and foremost, it is about explaining, as you quite rightly pointed out, Mr Schwab, and, together with Mr Masip Hidalgo, you have given us an example of this with the prize for young people or young entrepreneurs. I am a firm believer in contracts rather than constraints. By showing what this represents not only for the economy but also for other areas — Ms Flašíková and Mr Matula mentioned the public health and safety problems that can be caused by counterfeit products, particularly counterfeit medicines — we will set about using this positive explanation to show how damaging piracy and counterfeiting can be for the economy and for public health and safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thanks to the objective work of this observatory we will be able to develop information campaigns. We will also develop cooperation with the countries where these counterfeit products are coming from, as I told you, Mr Schwab. I was in China a few days ago specifically to talk about this. We will increase support for developing technology for detecting counterfeit goods and we will also, together with Mr Šemeta, improve training for the men and women who work on the various external borders of Europe (customs services, police) to participate in joint training on the fight against counterfeiting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what we will be able to do thanks to this observatory, which I firmly believe in, and that is also why I am thanking you for your support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Ţicău, Mr Baldassarre and Mr Karim mentioned the importance of innovation for the economy. That is also why, honourable Members, I am attaching so much importance to another instrument for protecting intellectual property, that is, the patent. Within a few weeks, we will finally arrive at the point of creating a patent, a single procedure for protecting industrial inventions, after 25 years of waiting, for at least 25, and, I hope, 27 countries. This will also serve to support innovation and creativity and therefore employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will not respond at length to Mr Nuttall, who has now left the Chamber, save to confirm what Ms Thein said, and I thank her for that. There will be no call for public contributions precisely because we are setting up this observatory to be supported by Alicante and because, as you explained very well Ms Thein, the Alicante office operates without public contributions, but with taxes and trade mark fees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One million trade marks are protected in Alicante. Mr Rübig asked about small and medium-sized enterprises, as did Ms Băsescu. Yet, out of these one million trade marks, several hundred thousand, and I was able to see this, are trade marks or designs which are protected by small, sometimes very small, and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also within our interest, Mr Rübig, to be situated in Alicante, because, there, with all of the open technology that is in place to enable us to search for, find and check trade marks, as I was able to see, we can rely on this network of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the main clients of the Office of Trade Marks in Alicante.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to finish by mentioning a point that Ms Regner and Ms Gáll-Pelcz mentioned, which is somewhat separate from this issue but which is important: the seemingly mounting controversy which arises at times in relation to the question of ACTA. I should like to invite all of the MEPs and interested parties to prove their objectiveness on this point and to be careful not to draw any hasty or definitive conclusions on these complex issues, because those of us called on to take part in the decision because of our respective institutional competences must all display a spirit of responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to hope that you will go ahead with the hearing you have planned on the question of ACTA for the beginning of March. This will be a good opportunity to get to the heart of the matter objectively, dispassionately — this is important — so that you yourselves may take a responsible decision in full knowledge of the facts. My colleague in charge of trade, Karel De Gucht, will explain himself fully in detail on this point at the debates planned for the end of February and the beginning of March in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of ACTA, I would just like to confirm that the Commission believes that ACTA would be a useful legal tool for ensuring greater respect and more efficient protection of intellectual property rights on an international scale. It is an instrument aimed at encouraging third countries to ensure a high, fair level of protection for intellectual property rights and, eventually, the same level that we have here in Europe. The Commission has always believed that ACTA will not change the acquis communautaire . This instrument will therefore not entail any obligation to make changes to the acquis communautaire , neither to the e-commerce directive nor the directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also believe, honourable Members, that ACTA is consistent with the EU Treaties, including — as Ms Regner mentioned — the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is all I wanted to say on this point. Thank you for your attention and your questions, and thank you very much to Mr Masip Hidalgo for his support and for the improvements he has made to this text with the help of each and every one of you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Perhaps in addition — I was thinking about this when I was listening to Mr Schwab — it would be useful for some of you from all of the political groups to go to Alicante to see for yourselves how this office operates once this report has been adopted and once the observatory is in place with this small team whom I met. There you will also see that the sunshine does not stop them from working hard, quite the opposite.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore suggest that a delegation of Members from all of the political groups — and perhaps I could go back with you — should go and see how the Office of Trade Marks and Designs operates and how this observatory, which you are establishing through your decision, can start to operate.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, many thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and all the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs who have worked so hard with me on this report. I have tried to include all their suggestions, not just in the text, but also in terms of the pace and the timetable which they themselves suggested.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to them, in all humility, that I hope to be able to help them as well and as faithfully as they have helped me when I make my contributions to the reports they will soon be undertaking themselves, particularly Mr Karim, with whom I hope to work in depth.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, given that we are speaking in the context of parliamentary courtesy, I should also like to suggest to Ms Lichtenberger and Mr Engström, who have worked very hard on this matter and whom I have consulted so often, that between now and the part-session in March, when we will vote on this report, they reconsider their abstentions, which they cast on the basis of preconceived ideas and uncertainty about whether the theory matches up with the reality. No, we are going to trust that the theory is both theory and good practice too. If they vote in favour, with us, and this report is approved — perhaps not unanimously by all Members but definitely by all the parliamentary groups, by the heads of the parliamentary groups — this will give us greater legitimacy to demand, as Ms Lichtenberger says, that practice and theory truly are not two different things, but rather that they are one and the same; that this can be achieved and that all of you can see it through, as I believe you deserve in your work.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I should mention that we could not go without the daily outburst of euroscepticism in Parliament, which was in fact quite disgraceful, since the person is not even here to listen to our response.</p>
      <p sl="es">Alicante, both city and region, cannot be blamed for being a seaside place, nor for being a heavenly location. It cannot be criticised either for being the place where Mr Campinos and all his team have done such an excellent job, as Mr Barnier has quite rightly said. We have visited them there. I led a European Union delegation on that visit, and I was fascinated by the work they are doing in Alicante. Anyone who still has any doubts about this issue should join the next delegation that Mr Barnier has encouraged us to arrange so that we can visit Alicante again.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to this eurosceptic that, when he was talking about something he knew nothing about, as Mr Karim quite rightly said, I was thinking about something that I do know about, the British writer Aldous Huxley, who at the end of his great novel Point Counter Point quotes the Bible through Burlap, one of his main characters, who says: ‘Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.’</p>
      <p sl="es">Indeed, the Kingdom of Heaven, the kingdom of Parliament, is made up of people such as these, who do not know what they are talking about, but they are – I hope – a qualified minority.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, set up in 2009, has become a centre of expertise for gathering, monitoring and reporting information related to infringements of intellectual property rights and a platform for cooperation in which stakeholders exchange ideas on best practice with a view to developing strategies for protecting intellectual property rights. I welcome the Commission’s proposal to entrust the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market with the tasks of the Observatory, with a view to improving its operations and improving the manner in which it fulfils its recently expanded responsibilities. In a context of the exponential growth of instances of counterfeiting and piracy, reducing the incentive for innovation of European enterprises and contributing to a reduction in the number of jobs, I believe it is appropriate to strengthen a coordinated policy in this regard. I should underline, moreover, that in terms of certain categories of products (medicines, toys, household electrical appliances, and so on), counterfeiting threatens human health and leads to a considerable decrease in the protection available to European consumers. I should like to stress the importance of guaranteeing that the information collected and disseminated by the Office for Harmonisation fulfils the criteria with regard to completeness and quality of data and that its activities are guided by robust transparency principles.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I note that my microphone button is clearly working, so I have the benefit of freedom of speech.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is quite clear that better access to commercial registers and better interconnection of commercial registers are of great importance and are highly desirable. The importance of these commercial registers for legal transactions and the economy is also obvious. The first Companies Directive dealing with the establishment of commercial registers and their content was adopted as far back as 1968. This is being amended here, along with the directives on branches and on mergers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commercial registers have been required to be kept electronically since 2007. It is evident, however, that the potential of this electronic register-keeping can only be fully exploited if, rather than sending stacks of files all over the place, communication between the registers also takes place electronically, if the registers are also accessible to outsiders, and finally – and very importantly – if everyone is on board, not just a few. We have to distinguish between, on the one hand, communication between the registers themselves – particularly main offices and branches – and, on the other hand, cross-border access by citizens, companies and advisers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament welcomed the Commission’s initiative from the start, and I can state that during the consultations agreement was reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on all the matters of substance. In this regard I should like to extend my thanks to all the representatives of the political groups, but also to the Commission, which contributed to this by tabling a very good proposal. I would like to thank not only the Danish Presidency, but also and above all the Polish Presidency, which put a great deal of effort into the details and pushed things forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention briefly a few key points. A platform is being created which can be accessed via the e-Justice Portal. Although it is not necessary for the Commission to run the platform itself, it was important to us that the Commission be responsible for it in law – and that is something we have achieved. The registers are too sensitive and too important to be simply handed over wholesale to private institutions. I would like to point out that in future there will be a core of information that is available in all the official languages at no cost; that companies will not be burdened with excessive administration, such as for setting up identifiers; that data protection has been ensured; and that, in future, the registers will be brought up to date much more quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commercial registers are kept at national and regional level, and will remain so. That will still be the case. We are merely regulating access and communication between the registers. The registers vary in standard, and unfortunately they also vary in reliability. A particularly important factor, however, is that the legal significance of the content of the registers differs from one Member State to another. This is a potential source of serious misunderstandings, particularly for inexperienced users. Reference must therefore be made to this when presenting the data, and information must be made available.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many of the technical details have yet to be clarified before the whole thing can be up and running. Since the registers are, after all, kept by the Member States, Parliament has stated that it is happy for these technical details to be decided to a certain extent by the Commission and the Member States within the framework of implementing provisions through learning by doing. All we can do here today is to establish the legal basis for setting up the whole thing and ensure that all the Member States have to participate, which was not the case previously.</p>
      <p sl="de">There remains a great deal of work to be done as regards the practicalities. I would like to see this working in reality as soon as possible, which would represent considerable progress in the internal market. I wish the initiative every success.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-079-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have just spoken about intellectual property, which concerns so many companies — I mentioned the one million trade marks proposed and protected in Alicante — and we are still talking about a Europe of practical progress based on the Commission’s proposals thanks to you and thanks to the Council of Ministers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wanted to emphasise this practical Europe and in particular this ambition I spoke of at the beginning of my term in office two years ago that together, with regard to the internal market and the economy, we must reconcile both small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers with this large market, whereas, up to now, these small and medium-sized enterprises have felt that the large single market was not made for them, but only for the big companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Lechner, I want to thank you and your colleagues, as this issue does concern small and medium-sized enterprises. By facilitating access to information for citizens, small businesses and public authorities, this interconnection will allow any EU citizen to use the network of commercial registers in their own language from a central access point to obtain information immediately about any European business no matter where it is based, and about its cross-border operations in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Until now, the lack of a network connecting national commercial registers made it very complicated to access information on companies in other Member States, resulting in considerable administrative and financial burdens for cross-border businesses. This additional cost, honourable Members, is estimated at around EUR 70 million per year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The lack of real interconnection between the registers has also resulted in less transparency for other businesses, consumers and public powers. This progress will therefore also lead to greater transparency; at the same time, we will improve legal certainty by allowing for around 17 000 foreign branches, which in reality have not been operational since their parent company was dissolved, to be removed from the register.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our initiative had two objectives: better access to information on companies and greater legal certainty for branches and cross-border operations. Furthermore, our proposal received strong support during the public consultation, not only from the private sector but also from the Council, the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me, Mr President, to express my sincerest thanks to your rapporteur, Kurt Lechner, for his work, to the shadow rapporteurs, Evelyn Regner and Alexandra Thein, and also to the Hungarian, Polish and Danish Presidencies, which supported this issue. I would also like to welcome and thank all of the parties, yourself and the Council for the sense of compromise they have shown in managing to finalise the adoption of this report so quickly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have a lot of expectations of the Commission. It will play a central role in the future system. I hope that we will measure up to our responsibilities, even though, let me remind you, there will inevitably be questions regarding financial resources. However, I have good reason to believe that these issues will be quickly resolved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Lechner, this interconnection of commercial registers for citizens and businesses, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, is a worthwhile project, as you have said, and I wanted to thank you for this progress, which we will bring about together towards the correct functioning of the single market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Lechner on the excellent work he has done, which clears the way for a measure that specifically meets the needs of business, particularly of small businesses, and contributes to the process of completing the internal market. The interconnection of national companies registers is of fundamental assistance to firms wishing to open a branch in another Member State or simply do business with enterprises in other states.</p>
      <p sl="it">As well as increasing consumer and user confidence in cross-border transactions, this interconnection will result in saving businesses a potential EUR 69 billion of costs every year. What is more, this measure will increase legal certainty, which will help to solve one of the problems businesses face most often in their cross-border activities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Notwithstanding that the interconnection is of a purely technical nature, and will not therefore also extend to the legal consequences arising from the use of registers, the transparency and the reliability of the information that this will be able to provide and guarantee form the basis on which consumers and information users can exercise and defend their rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I should point out that a special feature of this measure is that questions of a technical nature cannot be answered exhaustively. In other words, problems and the relevant solutions will arise and have to be developed in the course of the creation of the network. For this reason, the interconnection process will succeed only if, as I hope, the Commission and the Member States work together closely.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the interconnection of companies registers is a technical matter, but it is by no means only a technical matter. It concerns the greater European whole, and is about strengthening confidence in the internal market. It is also about strengthening the reciprocal trust that Member States have in each other’s legal systems. This alone represents excellent European added value.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to see this project go further; I would like to see it as a valuable step along the way, but not the final destination. Indeed, I would like our goal to be the setting up one day of a European companies register, and I hope that day is not too far off.</p>
      <p sl="de">A lot of thanks have been given today, and I would like to add my voice to these. Cooperation with the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, and with the shadow rapporteurs was constructive, and in particular cooperation with the Danish Presidency, with the Polish Presidency before that and with the Commission has also been extremely gratifying.</p>
      <p sl="de">My main concern in this report was for the registers to be as reliable as possible. Since we want all the Member States to participate, it is particularly important that we make it clear which Member State the data comes from and what its legal implications are. At the end of the day, the differences are far too great.</p>
      <p sl="de">A minimum standard of reliability can also only exist if any changes to the data are entered in the register without delay. In the report the period for notifying such changes is limited to 21 days. As a result, the registers should remain up-to-date and reliable.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the cost aspect. This is a further example of how constructive and how important it is to work together on this one step at a time. The argument of cost savings of EUR 60 to 70 million is indeed a weighty one that should serve to help drive forward the interconnection of companies registers as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report is therefore a really useful one that will make life easier for citizens in particular, but also for investors, companies and supervisory authorities. Let us carry on in this vein.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the interconnection of companies and commercial registers is a further milestone along the way to creating a European area of law. I am pleased that this matter, which is so important for our small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and which I advocated and promised to work for during my electoral campaign, has now – following trialogue negotiations – been successfully incorporated into a directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two aspects to this. Firstly, it gives citizens and companies easier cross-border access to commercial registers. Until now, if you wanted to access, say, a Greek commercial register, you had to instruct a Greek lawyer – who of course also had to speak your language, or at least a language that you had in common. The end result was extra costs and wasted time. This should now be able to take place via a platform. What is special about this platform is that I can make an enquiry in my own language and get an answer in my own language.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the commercial registers will now cooperate in a more institutionalised way, rather than on a voluntary basis as they have until now. Moreover, I regret to say that in the past one could not always rely on the entries in commercial registers of other Member States, particularly where the registration of branches in other Member States was concerned. We have now incorporated a requirement stating that, in future, entries must be made without delay or at latest within 21 days – provided, of course, that the conditions are met.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every company and every branch is to be given an identifier. The existing national commercial registers are not just kept only in their national language, but they also differ in many respects de facto and de jure ; for example, as regards their legal significance and the reliability of the data recorded.</p>
      <p sl="de">The directive aims only to interconnect the national registers in technical terms, not to harmonise the national systems. Nonetheless, for practical business life it is an extremely helpful measure that will encourage further integration of the internal market and will improve legal clarity and legal certainty for companies and citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that the considerable technical work and software work that will be required for this can be achieved on time, by the year 2014.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my colleague Mr Lechner has held some very weighty briefs in committee and he has once again done justice to the efforts that were required from him. I thank him for his approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is of course one of the proposals in the Single Market Act Communication which outlines 50 proposals to strengthen the internal market. It addresses an obvious missing link in the sharing of company information which will reduce administrative burdens for those seeking information across borders. It is actually estimated that it will save more than EUR 69 million per year.</p>
      <p sl="en">At EU level we are seeking to reach out, under our growth strategy, by means of free trade agreements. It is important that, whilst we do that, we also look internally and encourage companies to expand beyond their national borders and to operate across the single market. The legal certainty and increased transparency that comes from the sharing of information in this way will help them conduct their business in a more streamlined way, once again linking into our growth-focused strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say that this does not apply to all the initiatives coming from the Commission. Certainly the misguided contract sales law proposals are deeply unhelpful and unwanted.</p>
      <p sl="en">The interconnection of registers, rather than a centralised approach, makes this much more efficient as companies will not need to supply information on multiple occasions or go beyond existing requirements to provide information. I strongly encourage the Commission to come forward with other such genuinely growth-focused measures rather than – as I said before – unhelpful and unwanted instruments like the proposed sales law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our SMEs and other businesses and companies are crying out for a growth strategy at EU level, and in these strained times we are duty bound to deliver on that. Navel gazing is not the answer. We have to be brave, and we have to look outwards and reach out on their behalf.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, there is no doubt that a systematic improvement in public awareness of business structures operating under the legislative rules of individual countries will be necessary in order to successfully continue with the creation of a common economic space of the European Union. Registers of natural and legal persons engaged in business activities are compiled in individual countries according to national regulations, and therefore they naturally differ in structure and in the reliability of the recorded data.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Commission’s efforts towards the technical interconnection of the existing national registers will accelerate and streamline the exchange of information between registers and facilitate access for citizens and businesses to the business databases of other Member States. Such a coordinated, informed platform can certainly be a good first step towards the clarification of the complex business structure of the European Union. I am aware of the technical difficulty of such a project, but I firmly believe that it can significantly contribute to the provision of information and strengthen legal certainty in the European business environment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in light of the facilities offered by the single market, many European companies also carry out economic activities in other EU Member States. For legal and commercial reasons, company information must be accessible in real time throughout the entire European Union. Creating a European central platform will enable this to happen by linking up Member States’ commercial registers. It will also enhance transparency, thanks to the use of a unique identifier for companies and their branches in other countries. This measure will remove legal uncertainties, especially when companies with subsidiaries in several countries are closed down. The new provisions will also facilitate the necessary cooperation between national registers during mergers between companies in different states.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that suitable protection also needs to be given to personal data. In this context, I welcome Amendment 21 tabled by the European Parliament. I also welcome the other improvements made to the draft directive at Parliament’s suggestion. I am thinking in particular about the areas regulated by delegated acts. The clarifications regarding the funding method for the new European connection system are also suitable.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to mention that the National Trade Register Office in Romania recently launched a new IT platform. It provides practical benefits to the business sector and creates the conditions for connecting to other EU Member States. In fact, on the very first day that the new online platform was in operation, a higher number of applications were registered than the daily average, highlighting the benefits for users.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the aim of the directive is a purely technical interconnection between existing national registers, and not a harmonisation of their legal requirements. As part of e -government services, the interconnection of national registers concerns solely the exchange of information currently available in registers and not the introduction of a business register containing its own data. Only interconnection will leverage the full potential inherent in maintaining computerised registers. By using implementing acts the Commission is adopting the technical specifications which define: communication methods based on electronic means for the register interconnection system; communication protocols; technical measures ensuring the minimum security standards for communicating and distributing information within the register interconnection system; the detailed list of data transmitted for the purpose of exchanging information between registers; the set of data required for the platform to perform its functions, as well as the method of storage, use and protection of such data, and the structure and use of the unique identifier for communication between registers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Those are some benefits of this directive. Using the e-justice portal as an electronic access point to legal provisions, information about registers and European and national databases is an inspired choice. Initially designed to support judicial and police cooperation, this tool is now being extended to administrative cooperation in relation to the functioning of the single market. This will consolidate the utility and reliability of the platform and will provide additional incentives for enhanced mutual trust between Member States’ administrations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The concrete procedures and technical specifications are being left for subsequent Commission implementing acts. This is why the Commission needs to foresee efficient means to ensure that data protection requirements will be observed and enforced effectively by all Member States. Particular attention should be paid to such procedures as effective automatic data transfers between registers, as provided for in the amended Recital 15.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, the new directive has the potential to enhance competition, in parallel with trust, by building confidence in the business environment of the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, taking advantage of the opportunities of the internal market, European companies are increasingly starting to operate abroad, that is to say beyond their national borders. Demand for access to information on companies in a cross-border context is therefore rising. Official information on companies from other Member States, however, is not always readily available, and the current voluntary cooperation between registers does not appear to be adequate. This is why the interconnection of central registers, business registers and company registers could and, especially, should contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of European businesses by reducing the administrative burden and increasing legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Making use of innovations in information and communication technologies should improve cross-border communications between registers. I strongly believe, however, that a shift in cross-border access to business information can take place only if all Member States are involved in building an electronic network, and business information users are provided with information in a standardised form across the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Lechner sincerely on the excellent work he has done and to emphasise the three grounds that give me the most satisfaction in the debate that we are engaged in with regard to the Commissioner’s words on the interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers.</p>
      <p sl="it">This directive will essentially make sure we take three steps forward. First, businesses wishing to open a branch in another state or do business with enterprises operating in other states will be able to do so more easily and more flexibly. This substantially guarantees the completion of the single market and does so by increasing the options available to European businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">Second, this directive will result in cost savings of EUR 69 billion per year for European businesses of this type, which cannot fail to improve their competitiveness. It is an absolutely fundamental response from Europe at a time of crisis like the present. This is therefore a directive that enhances competitiveness through transparency and legality.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am in favour of the view that a directive concerning commercial registers is, without doubt, a step in the right direction. If this directive comes into force, companies and citizens will find it much easier to communicate with each other and will be able to obtain clear and up-to-date information much faster. The directive leaves legal issues concerning commercial registers under the management of individual states, and focuses on technical aspects. I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that this technical area will no doubt require additional work, especially as regards contacts of an international nature. There is therefore still a great deal of work ahead of us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lechner, because this particular register in the European languages will naturally open up opportunities to bring together new customers and suppliers.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank you all for the support you have lent to this initiative, particularly Mr Silvestris just a moment ago, Ms Ţicău, Mr Zemke, Ms Băsescu and Mr Baldassarre who provided economic support for this project. I would also like to say to Mr Baldassarre, and to each and every one of you, that this project concerns large companies just as much as smaller companies. Mr Baldassarre had the opportunity, particularly when he presented the report on the patent, to prove just how much personal attention he had paid to the place and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Regner, you also supported this initiative and mentioned the idea that it should go further by putting in place a true common European register. Personally, I think that it is logical for us to have such common tools in the context of the single market. Just a short time ago we spoke about the Trade Marks Office. I could also mention the Patents Office. A common register could be useful for businesses but, as you know Ms Regner, we are building Europe and this single market step by step, stage by stage. Today this network pooling and interconnecting national networks, this common access point is a first step. That is how we must look at things.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say to Ms Thein, who mentioned the functioning of this platform with the native languages of each speaker, that it is important that we are able to do this, in particular thanks to modern technology. We will do it for the patent by speeding up research on software that will allow us to deliver quality translations in all languages immediately. This is something that will also be facilitated for the IMI network as well as for this interconnection of commercial registers and the European patent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank Mr Karim for his comments about the Single Market Act. Mr Karim, as you know, we submit proposals week after week, all of which are aimed at supporting businesses in order to create the most favourable ecosystem for innovation, mobility, exports, trade, investment and venture capital. The Commission has already presented 10 of the priority proposals. We are working on other proposals within the framework of the Single Market Act and this year we will have the chance to come together again with the committees for a second wave of proposals. The one you will vote on today or tomorrow will be part of that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say to Mr Paška and Ms Flašíková that we are working towards creating this network of national registers and that this implies, Ms Flašíková, good cooperation between all the holders, all the actors, all those who are responsible, all the managers of national networks in order for this to work successfully.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, both Mr Rübig and Ms Macovei mentioned respect for the protection of individuals’ personal data. Yes, the project we are presenting today respects the protection of data. That is a key element. We must nonetheless remember that we are talking about data which is already available to the public, as far as access to information on companies is concerned. However, we were careful to consult the European data protection supervisor prior to this. For the processing of personal data, the proposal for a directive already referred to the provisions laid down in the Data Protection Directive. This provision was rejected by the Council. Thanks to you it was reintroduced by Parliament during the trialogue and I am very pleased about that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is all I wanted to say and once again I would like to express my sincerest thanks to your rapporteur Mr Lechner for the quality of his work and for the progress we will make together again towards the good functioning of the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the many invariably positive contributions, which have shown that we all consider this project to be important, useful and necessary. In contrast to some of the formulaic and lofty sentiments that are often heard at European level, I would like to add – and I say this quite self-critically – that we are advancing the internal market here in a very concrete, measurable and even visible way. Certainly a number of important technical issues are still outstanding, but this was not just about technicalities; it was also about content, which was something we were all able to agree on.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to what was said by one honourable Member, I would like to reiterate that the mention of third countries in one of the recitals was included at Parliament’s request. For legal reasons it was not possible to include this in the actual text of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning now to Ms Regner’s comments, I would like to add, with regard to standardisation, that it is going to be difficult, but perhaps we can do it step by step. However, the interconnection of these registers will increase their importance, and perhaps one or two Member States – without naming names – will then take the opportunity to check the reliability and precision of their registers, and bring them into line with the other standards. That, too, would be progress. My wish now is that we really get going on this, so that we can see its results in two years’ time.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am pleased to hear about the EU’s intention to deal with the issue of commercial registers. Cross-border business by many entities operating on European markets and the wide legal and administrative variations in data held in commercial registers have frequently caused problems for companies doing business in the EU. We should not forget that as part of the European Charter for Small Enterprises we made undertakings to simplify administrative procedures in Member States as regards business activity. We should therefore be consistent in our actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that a series of measures to be taken to systematise and integrate commercial registers should be agreed by way of close cooperation between the European Commission and the Member States. Our objective should be to improve the system for providing our citizens with easy access to the information that is required. Whenever there is an opportunity to do so I try to emphasise that it is efficient SMEs, unencumbered by additional complicated administrative procedures, that offer the EU the best chance of an effective way out of the present crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report drafted by Kurt Lechner provides a step forward with regard to transparency and access to information for companies in the European Union. I have no doubts that the future combined register will be a useful tool for European businesspeople, who will be able, using a single system, to check basic information about their future partners even if they are registered at the other end of Europe. There was however a moment when it seemed that for reasons of a more or less technical nature, it would not be possible to complete work on this project within a reasonable time-scale. For this reason I would like to emphasise the extraordinary amount of time and effort put into this by our rapporteur Mr Lechner, as well as by the Polish Presidency. Both parties made every effort to bring about a legal framework for the future functioning of the combined commercial registers along lines that could be accepted by everyone. I think that the compromise that was reached is satisfactory not just for the rapporteur, but also for all the shadow rapporteurs. Issues such as protection of personal data or delegated acts that are important to the European Parliament were kept in mind during negotiations. The last three months demonstrated that good cooperation between Parliament and the Council can result in rapid and effective decisions that are helping to simplify the growth of business activity within the common European market.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this may be a surprise, but problems at Schipol airport, where there was a bomb alert today, have meant that Ms Essayah unfortunately cannot be here at the moment, so she has asked me to represent her.</p>
      <p sl="en">On her behalf, I would like to say that she is very happy with the outcome of the trialogue and the agreement which we reached with the Commission and the Council. She would like to thank the representatives of the Council, Commissioner Barnier, the Chair of the ECON committee, Ms Bowles, the shadow rapporteurs and all those who proposed amendments and contributed to this excellent result, as well as the ECON Secretariat which makes our work possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The completion of the Single European Payment Area is of great importance for the European internal market and has numerous benefits for our citizens. From February 2014 onwards, all electronic payments in the euro area will be as easy as cash payments. Citizens and companies will benefit from SEPA in several ways, but the most obvious of them is that is possible to make payments to all over Europe from a single bank account. That is now possible for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="en">All cross-border debit and credit transfers can now be done as if they were normal domestic payments. With SEPA only one bank account is needed for the whole euro area by using the international bank account number or IBAN. This has many great advantages: only one bank account will be needed for the whole euro area. If a person is working abroad he or she will not need a new bank account in that country and may receive his or her salary to the one bank account in his or her own home country.</p>
      <p sl="en">SEPA will also make it possible to use one and the same debit card anywhere in the euro area, so when you are on holiday or visiting another euro area country you will be able to benefit from these possibilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">SEPA is good news at present concerning the euro and the EU. It will open up national markets to competition and make the payment sector more effective. According to an impact study published by the Commission, SEPA will benefit the European economy by EUR 123 billion over the next six years. The benefits will be even greater because SEPA creates favourable conditions for innovations such as automatically combining payments with the book-keeping of a company. This is the case in Finland and in other countries such as the Netherlands, which started implementing SEPA at a very early stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Easy payments also make it very easy to buy goods and services via the internet from all over the EU. Consumers will have real options to compare prices and get the best price. Buying a computer from the cheapest EU retailer may save hundreds of euros, making prices go down everywhere in the single market. Therefore SEPA is in many ways essential for a well-functioning internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since moving to SEPA has been too slow in the past, this regulation sets a clear end-date for the transition. Parliament has succeeded in negotiating a single end date for both SEPA credit transfers and direct debits: 1 February 2014. In those Member States which do not have the euro as their currency, the date will be 30 October 2016. This will make it easier to adapt to the change and to carry out information campaigns for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has also achieved the right level of consumer protection: consumers may now instruct their banks to limit direct debit collection to certain amounts and to establish positive or negative lists of payees. It will no longer be necessary for consumers to provide banks with special BIC codes for domestic or cross-border payments after the end-date and after two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">For ease of adaptation to the new system, several waivers provide a two-year transition period after the end-date. For example, a Member State may allow companies which use badge files sent to their payment service providers to avoid using the standard message format XML for two years. A Member State may also allow consumers to use their old bank account number instead of IBANs for two extra years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Payment Services Directive is being reviewed later this year; this will be an important step in finalising the entire system and ensuring that it works. On behalf of Ms Essayah, I would like to underline that we are very happy for both citizens and companies in the European Union and throughout the SEPA area that all cross-border transfers and direct debits can be done as if they were normal domestic payments. We have now managed to achieve a real single European payments area.</p>

    <intervention id="1-104-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and its Chair Ms Bowles and I would ask Corien Wortmann-Kool to send my warmest thanks to Sari Essayah for her work in cooperation with your shadow rapporteurs Sophie In’t Veld, Sven Giegold and Ivari Padar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Payment services are simply vital for our economies. Without a payments market that works at its best, the internal market cannot live up to its full potential in terms of trade and growth. The regulation we are debating aims to speed up the implementation of SEPA (the Single Euro Payments Area), as Corien Wortmann-Kool said. The SEPA project aims to develop and is in the process of developing payments services in euro which are no longer fragmented from one country to another but common to the whole of the EU, and it replaces national payment services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the perfect example, honourable Members, of financial regulation for those in the real economy: SEPA will make cross-border payments as easy as domestic ones and will provide greater reliability and security for European citizens and businesses. They will benefit from increased competition in this area and — I think — from lower payment costs. This should also increase innovation and give an additional concrete dimension to the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to welcome the progress made in this compromise compared to the Commission’s initial proposal. This is further proof of the real usefulness of the intelligent work we have done together, as you said Ms Wortmann-Kool, particularly during the trialogues. I notice, to my delight, that many of the Commission’s texts have been improved and clarified thanks to the work of Parliament. The report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs prepared by Ms Essayah has therefore made a significant contribution to improving our proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new text is more favourable to consumers. I shall give you two examples: firstly, the scheduled phasing out of BIC codes from 2014, which means one less piece of information for the consumer to provide to make a transfer, whether it is a national or international transfer, and, secondly , the removal of additional charges for all cross-border payments effective as soon as the regulation enters into force.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, the Commission regrets that the principle of two separate migration dates for credit transfers and direct debits has been abandoned. From our point of view, this would have helped to speed up the migration process and rewarded the most advanced Member States, providers and businesses. That being said, a single end-date should also facilitate communication on the transition to SEPA, and particularly the use of new IBAN account numbers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, the Commission is therefore happy overall with the current final compromise. We are ready to look into the governance of SEPA by the end of this year — there is progress to be made — and also into the issue of consumers’ right to unconditional refunds for direct debits within the framework of the revised directive on payment services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These two items have each been the subject of a declaration of principle, along with a third on the Commission’s use of delegated powers. As agreed, these three declarations appear in the annex of the resolution submitted to you and reflect the compromise reached in December word for word.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, Mr President, with this regulation we are providing the payments market with the legal framework it needs. We are contributing to the creation of a truly integrated payments market in euro in the EU. Finally, we are providing European citizens and businesses with a market where payments will be made throughout the whole of the EU as quickly and efficiently as national payments, in a completely reliable way and I believe that, thanks to increased competition, this will lead to lower costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the third point we have discussed since the start of this afternoon which represents concrete progress for the single market, both for citizens and for businesses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has also deliberated in detail on the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA, because this issue is very much concerned with consumer protection. I can state that I am very happy with the compromise reached, because it also incorporates some of the topics adopted by us in committee. It is a very good thing that we can say to consumers that we are thinking of them, too, in the area of the financial markets, because they do not always get that impression.</p>
      <p sl="de">Borders for payment transactions are borders in Europe. It is time that these were removed, so that they no longer stand in the way of European mobility. I very much welcome the fact that it has been established that, in future, all enterprises and consumers will be able to make euro payment transactions in other European countries from a single account at any bank. This is very important, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Not just for enterprises, though, but also for consumers who are mobile, who go on holiday and who want to make credit transfers. It is also very good that we have ensured that there is a single migration date for credit transfers and direct debits. It would not have been good for consumers to have two different dates, as that would have resulted in greater confusion. Clarity and legal certainty – that is what we need, and that is what we have achieved here.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third and last point concerns the information given to citizens. That is also extremely important. A great many of them are afraid of this new SEPA number, of the new IBAN code, because it seems too long to them. If we tell them quite clearly how it is composed, however, then they will not find it so difficult and complicated at all. In other words, it is very important that we have an information campaign so that people know what this is all about.</p>

      <p sl="et">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Essayah, for her truly masterful and determined work. I would also like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs. This report is an excellent example of how applying the Community method can achieve truly progressive results that further advance a common noble idea.</p>
      <p sl="et">The organisation of cross-border settlements in euros was badly in need of common rules and understandings. The existing chaos, in which Member States used different approaches and rates, was detrimental to the consumer and clouded the spirit of the single market. At the same time, during all of this work one had to take into consideration the existing regulations in different Member States and seek compromises.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is clear that every change has its price, and it takes time to adjust to changes. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament comprehensively based its activities on the objectives of European Union regulations, while at the same time emphasising the importance of defending functioning local practices that reach the consumer. It is for this reason that we have supported a single date in the implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Here I would particularly like to emphasise some aspects proposed by the S&amp;D Group over which agreements have been reached.</p>
      <p sl="et">First, the topic of possible prices or price rises. Regardless of the fact that increasing competition in this sector should lead to lower prices, we recommended that the Commission should be particularly attentive in the initial phase of implementing the regulation. Second, administration of the SEPA was formerly solely under the control of the banks, whereas the regulation emphasises the importance of involving all parties in management and supervision. Third, the non-compulsory nature of bank identifier codes or long codes in domestic payments as of 1 February 2014 and in cross-border payments from 1 February 2016.</p>
      <p sl="et">Fourth, the smooth transition from the basic bank account number (BBAN) domestic standard to the international bank account number (IBAN) international standard.</p>
      <p sl="et">Fifth, the validity of old mandates, which has in all honesty saved us from possible legal ambiguities and was also altogether rational.</p>
      <p sl="et">Sixth, the transition period applied to large-scale domestic systems. In conclusion I would like to say that the SEPA is a very good example of how collective effort achieves progress in a manner in which all parties win. It has been estimated that clients, banks and companies could save up to EUR 123 billion over six years thanks to the SEPA. This is certainly worthy of joint action, and we should have other similar undertakings in the future. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all my thanks to the rapporteur who is, I understand, stuck at Schipol airport. She did a very good job. I will not go into the details of the proposals because the rapporteur’s representative has set out all the expected benefits from SEPA. I would instead like to focus on the process that has taken place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Quite frankly, if you listen to the benefits that we expect to get from SEPA, it is completely incomprehensible why it has to take so long, why there are such long transition periods and why there are so many exemptions. We are in the middle of an economic crisis. We all agree that we need to complete the internal market, and I am really worried at how something relatively minor, like SEPA credit transfers and direct debits, can take so long and be so difficult.</p>
      <p sl="de">I understand that people will have to get used to new systems, but if you look at what we are asking of our Greek fellow-citizens, if you look at the changes in the Arab Spring, do we really think that changing from 12 to 18 digits in a bank account number is the main worry in the European Union? Sorry, but we need to change, Europe needs to change. We need to complete the internal market; we need to strengthen our economic position in the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">Payments are the lubricant of the single market, certainly with a view to e-commerce, and therefore I hope that all the Member States will meet the deadlines, which are very generous. I also hope that when we talk about new payment methods, which we are going to look at next, the process will be speedier than it has been so far.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first express my thanks – to you, too, Mr Barnier – for the cooperative manner in which our deliberations were conducted. The background to this report is, of course, that for a single market Europe needs a Single Euro Payments Area. This has shown how long it takes when people refuse and delay European standards instead of creating them together. As Ms in 't Veld quite rightly said, all this could actually have been done faster; we could probably have achieved something for consumers more quickly, and it did not need to take this long for small and medium-sized enterprises to get the necessary standard.</p>
      <p sl="de">The big question now is what will happen with regard to the right of return. Here in Parliament, we wanted the right to return direct debits to be unconditional. Thankfully, that is the next thing the Commission is to look into. However, it is important that the unconditional return rights can remain at national level, because on that basis Germany can avoid the chaos inherent in migrating several hundred million existing direct debits.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it is equally important that Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the electronic direct debit process in Germany, which is already established and which saves millions every year, can be Europeanised.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last but not least, it is also important that democracy will prevail in respect of payment flows in future. Thank you, Mr Barnier, for having accepted our proposal that the European Payment Council should no longer act alone in setting standards, but that instead payment transactions should be included in the democratic sphere. I look forward to further work in this area.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are holding perhaps appears to be taking place at the wrong place and at the wrong time. I may have this impression due to the resolutions passed by the Greek Parliament yesterday in dramatic circumstances, although austerity and recession are, of course, not just a Greek problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are debating transfers, payments in euro, at a time when the crisis is getting worse, the recession is getting deeper and austerity is embracing entire sections of Europe, and it is somewhat ironic of us to say that we must resolve this problem at a time when European citizens and the nations of Europe possibly have no euros in their pockets. Those demanding that we move ahead with a Single Euro Payments Area are obviously the markets, the financial systems and the multinational companies, which stand to benefit directly.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nonetheless, as we must also protect consumer rights in this environment, my comments are as follows: firstly, because the change to this system will be very costly, it should not be the citizens who pay the price, in keeping with the banks’ standard practice of passing such costs on to their customers. The report does not cover that point.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, systematic efforts should be made to inform and advise citizens and, thirdly and most importantly, because the change will also apply to e-money, we need measures, which the report does not address, to prevent fraud at the consumer’s expense. It is, I think, a good thing that we have a date and that interbank charges will be abolished. This should also apply to credit cards.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question . – Madam President, Mr Chountis, I was taken aback by what you just said. Is Greece so isolated that it does not perform bank transfers to other countries? Are you not simply going to end up with the same problem in the future that you had before: namely, that a lot of your countrymen emigrate and then send money back as migrant workers? Moreover, when you speak of banks being unable to make a profit any more, can you not see that this standardisation will itself actually reduce one other type of profit that the banks currently make – that from transfer fees?</p>

      <p sl="el">Blue-card answer . – I will answer the last question first, because perhaps what I said was not correctly understood. The banks will benefit, I do not deny it. Perhaps, therefore, I have been misunderstood.</p>
      <p sl="el">As for the rest of what you said, Mr Martin, I do not disagree, but I will put the matter on its real basis or, at least ask this: ‘what times are we living in?’ and if income is reduced, the question: ‘what economic circumstances are we living in today and what economic circumstances is the European Union in?’ becomes a very weighty question. I imagine that you cannot deny that and the fact that this recession and austerity are cutting income is not just Greece’s problem. That being so, as you saw, I addressed this issue with comments which, that given, might improve it.</p>

I fully feel responsibility, and also co-responsibility, for the European integration project. But what I do not understand is this. You made very specific points on the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and about what had to change, but I did not see you at the shadow meetings. We had a very open process to work on this.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, basically, this is a good project, and is certainly worthy of our broad support here in Parliament. It will be far more convenient for ordinary people, but especially companies, if we can use just one set of payment details throughout Europe, and if direct debits and electronic billing are simplified. This is one of the most crucial issues in building a viable internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fi">However, a practical problem has arisen, in that, once again, some countries have been more efficient than others in implementing joint decisions. As long as only some have adopted the system, there will not be much benefit to be had from it, the basic idea will not be realised and there will not be the savings made that we had hoped for.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In fact, the system is even slightly bothersome for the citizens of countries that have introduced the changes. In my country, Finland, for example, people now have to use longer account numbers than before, which are all the more difficult to remember.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Ordinary people have had to make a small sacrifice to start using the system, and while foreign payments ought to have become as easy as domestic payments, in actual fact, domestic payments have become as difficult as foreign ones.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The reform, therefore, should not be left half-finished, and there should be no hesitation about completing it, so that the trouble it has caused will not have been in vain. On this basis, I would support an approach where the transitional periods for adopting the system must be as smooth and as short as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, one recurrent demand of all those who view many things here as being too bureaucratic and too centralist has certainly always been: we need to be able to feel that Europe is a reality. I find that the very fact that we are now making decisions here together means that we are taking a step towards a European spring! Things are warming up, we are beginning to feel like leaving our homes and getting together with other people. I come from a region which has Switzerland and Germany as its immediate neighbours. Once, I had to pay a traffic fine in Lindau: DEM 5. Because I was very late responding, it went up to DEM 10. However, after all the bank transactions had been carried out, I ended up paying DEM 70: that is, seven times more than the original charge, or 14 times more, depending on how you look at it. These are the kind of trivial things which make people absolutely furious and cause them to ask: we are supposed to have something in common with our European neighbours, but what exactly? Today, we can finally get a feel for what it is we have in common, now that it is not going to cost us any extra.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, a great number of small and medium-sized enterprises have always done business abroad. Even Austrians – would you believe it? – do business abroad, in countries like Germany and the Czech Republic, in particular, but also in all other parts of the expanding Europe. Moreover, the costs of transferring money used to be far from inconsiderable. We are talking here about pretty large amounts – 0.25% of the cost of the transaction. After some painstaking negotiations, this was then reduced, in most cases, to one eighth of the transaction but, in the case of some transfers, the fee shot up even further. There was a need to run multiple accounts, which greatly complicated the whole bookkeeping process, and when the authorities wanted to make appropriate checks, they proved to be much more difficult and inefficient.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is good that we are finally getting to the point that we are at now. However, it is also true that we wanted this to happen much earlier. This is a step in the direction in which we all want to be heading, namely having greater transparency about cash flows and joint cash flows. In that regard, I reiterate that it would make me very happy if we took more of these kinds of initiatives that would bring us this kind of European spring.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you know how much I appreciate your actions and everything you are doing. The issue we are dealing with this evening is important. It happens that I was rapporteur for the directive on payment services in the previous mandate. I therefore know how important it is to work towards harmonising payment services across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This evening, allow me simply to discuss one issue which angers people: multilateral interchange fees. From the beginning, I have defended these fees and I had the opportunity to do so when we launched the first SEPA transfer in 2007. Interchange fees are legitimate. What is not legitimate is setting them at rates which are excessively high.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why are these fees legitimate? They are legitimate because payment services are a commercial service. The institutions, that is, banks or payment institutions established under Title II of the directive I mentioned just a moment ago, must undertake commercial activity. It is therefore normal that they should receive remuneration. This must obviously be justified by the service provided and, from this point of view, interchange fees — it is true — were, for a certain period of time, set unduly high.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, today, things have changed and the situation we are arriving at thanks to this new text, this regulation, is something of a paradox. Firstly, this text regulates an issue which was under discussion in the Court of Justice of the European Union; it authorises interchange fees at national level until 2017. It bans them sooner for cross-border operations but allows interchange fees to operate if payment is refused or rejected. None of that is very consistent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must not let what has been done this time serve as an example for the coming regulation on bank cards. Reflection must be better led in this area and the fact that only six countries have resorted to using interchange fees does not mean to say that they are useless. Why? Because otherwise there is no transparency; we would pay for payment services using other means of payment, for example, cheques.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I support the proposal for creating an internal market for payment services in euros, as it is bound, in practical terms, to facilitate considerably the system made available to European consumers who will be able to use a single method of payment and single type of account for transferring money within the European Union. This initiative will make cross-border payment transactions more efficient, unifying a fragmented European market and yielding economic benefits. As you are aware and has been mentioned, the European Commission estimates that reducing costs means that these benefits could amount to billions of euros in six years.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also welcome deadlines being set for migrating from the current national systems to a common system so that the transition process is not prolonged unnecessarily. I noticed how the initial strategy adopted by the European executive for transferring credit, according to which the transition was meant to be carried out by the private sector at a flexible pace, did not produce the anticipated results. Based on the figures I have available, in February 2011, two and a half years after the initiative was launched, only 15.7% of the total amount of credit transferred from the euro area was transacted using the European payments system.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I believe that consumers must be afforded protection throughout the whole process of migrating to the new system. This is why, Commissioner, I suggest that you produce information campaigns to which the banking sector is obliged to make an active, practical contribution.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, despite the fact that Bulgaria is still not part of the euro area, there are some sectors in the Bulgarian economy in which contract negotiations and payments are now commonly transacted in euro. An example of one such sector is the property market and renting. Nevertheless, when someone wishes to make a transfer in Bulgaria, even from one Bulgarian bank to another, this transfer, being in a foreign currency, is considered a cross-border transaction. The result is that a fee is collected from both the payer and the recipient, which is rather high at that. For example, the total fee charged for a standard rental price of EUR 200-300 is EUR 32. This is a cost increase of 10%. I believe that if the regulation we are discussing at the moment is accepted as proposed, it will mark an important step towards abolishing this highly unfair treatment of European consumers, and especially of those who live in countries outside the euro area. However, there is another important aspect which this regulation highlights. It is that, despite all the talk that taxes, interest rates and so on can only be determined by market conditions, with the proposals made in this regulation, we are proving that these items can be determined by legal acts. This is the proof for accepting this act here in Europe, and this is the direction we must follow</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, a common internal market requires a common currency and a common currency requires a payments area. The implementation of these three objectives has faced a very rocky road in many cases and there remain some who are still opposed to it. That is why the European Parliament and the Council are finishing off the job properly today. The deadline for the completion of the Single Euro Payments Area in the euro area is 1 February 2014 and 30 October 2016 is the deadline for countries within the European Union that are outside the euro area. It is true that we could be moving more quickly than this, but we need to realise that, from now on, entrepreneurs will no longer be required to set up a separate account in every Member State in which they operate. We are on course for a situation where a citizen of one Member State will be able to work in another Member State and, at the same time, have his wages paid directly into his home bank account, where we will be able to save EUR 1 billion and where the interbank fee will effectively be abolished. For that reason, with this decision today, we have done a great deal for consumers and increased the added value of membership of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The President and I have shared the responsibility for the information and communication work. This is a good example of why there needs to be a European Union and what benefits our citizens get from it. We are not only making savings, we are also facilitating access and have, at the same time, been able to effectively save the chargeback and maintain electronic direct debits and, what is more, none of the old payment orders have needed changing. This is a good compromise and, at the same time, a step forward.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the creation of an integrated market for electronic payments in euros, with no fundamental distinction between national and cross-border payments, is essential for the proper functioning of the internal market. Although this initiative from the Commission could have come earlier, we are pleased to have it here.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The aim of the Single Euro Payments Area project is to develop common EU-wide payment devices to replace current national payment devices. SEPA should provide EU citizens and businesses with secure, user-friendly and reliable payment services in euros at competitive prices. It can also be expected that there will be space for the creation of favourable conditions for increased competition in payment services and the unlimited development and rapid implementation of innovations relating to payments. This should lead to increased savings, due in particular to enhanced operating efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="sk">At the same time, this will create an across-the-board downward price pressure, which should have significant effects in particular in Member States where payments are relatively expensive in comparison with other countries. The success of SEPA is very important from the economic, monetary and, of course, political perspectives. It is fully in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims at a smarter economy. It therefore seems reasonable and important to achieve a smooth and rapid transition to SEPA. The Single Payments Area is a good example of a common EU-wide approach and is also beneficial for our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, technological progress and the Single European Payments Area will certainly have benefits, such as better liquidity planning, achieved through SEPA information about the exact date of a debit, or shorter bank transfer periods – which, incidentally, will mean that any additional profit which might have been earned by the banks evaporates – or the fact that credit cards can be used throughout Europe, not only at cash points, but also to make payments.</p>
      <p sl="de">IBAN and BIC may, indeed, have their benefits, but they are more complicated and many people, especially the elderly, are not very familiar with them. Therefore, I welcome the fact that Parliament has committed to retaining existing direct debits. In particular, in the light of the massive increase in cyber crime involving allegedly free online offers which often turn out to cost the consumer a great deal, attacks by hackers, the theft of personal data and, above all, phishing for bank details, all of which cause serious financial losses, it is, in my view, all the more important that the unconditional right to cancel direct debits is retained.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, if we are to strengthen confidence in the Single Euro Payments Area, we also need to tackle the problem of faults in cheap software for banking transactions carried out via smartphones. It is, after all, supposed to be providers who take responsibility for credit card fraud, not customers. Likewise, banks, too, should take responsibility, where necessary, for faults in their technical systems.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, this is a further, significant step forward, because the Single Euro Payments Area will, as from the fateful date of 1 February 2014, represent the end of a journey that began with the common market and in which the single currency was an important stopping point.</p>
      <p sl="it">It gives us an important economic advantage – as the Commissioner, to whom I am grateful for this, pointed out – which will result in cost savings of a billion euros a year compared to now, and which also represents a huge advantage for consumers. For this reason, the Single Euro Payments Area represents a welcome step forward for the Community method, which is at the very heart of this Parliament just as it is at the heart of my country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the Single Euro Payments Area is vital to the completion of the internal market. Thanks to the close link between invoices and payments, the Single Euro Payments Area provides a platform for an interoperable European e -invoicing system. The large-scale adoption of e -invoicing will encourage, in turn, the migration of financial instruments to the Single Euro Payments Area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To ensure that these mutual benefits are achieved, the e -invoicing standard must conform to ISO standard 20022 for financial services messages, which is used in the Single Euro Payments Area. Similarly, both e -invoicing and the Single Euro Payments Area should be integrated into the public online payment systems developed by the public authorities in Member States and by European Union institutions.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Europe needs reliable and efficient payment systems to ensure the proper functioning of the single market. National plans are unable to provide sufficient impetus to achieve a rapid, complete migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). SEPA is the basic component used to create an internal payments market. It will help cut costs and enable significant savings to be made. For example, the potential benefits from SEPA could amount to EUR 300 billion within six years.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is important to set a common deadline for the migration of direct debits and credit transfers in euros. At the same time, multilateral interchange fees for direct debits need to be regulated. However, I think that greater efforts need to be made to promote SEPA products actively.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the functioning of the EU internal market without the dismantling of borders in the banking sector would certainly be problematic. Therefore, efforts to create a single European system for carrying out transactions by moving from national to international standards is an understandable change that will simplify payments within the European Union for our citizens and companies.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The fact that, from 2014, citizens of the euro area and, from November 2016, citizens of other EU countries will carry out cross-border payment orders and direct debits in the European Union under the same conditions as at the national level is, I think, a natural expression of integration and the building of a common market that our citizens and businesses will certainly welcome.</p>

In this light, Commissioner, my question is this: can we be certain that these regulations, which are to apply to all of the EU in 2016 – this is to take place on 30 October of that year – will also apply to the United Kingdom?

      <p sl="fr">Since I am talking about protecting consumers and information, I should like to say to Mr Cutaş, Mr Padar, Mr Chountis and Mr Terho — Mr Padar spoke about change — that it really is a change, even a cultural change that we are speeding up and facilitating. We must therefore inform some people and I think I can say that the banks are committed to this task of providing information, including for the security of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also say to Mr Padar, as well as to Ms Mazej Kukovič, who just spoke, that I will follow and that we will follow the implementation of this regulation with great attention, with our desire to work with the banks and ensure proper implementation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also want to say that I am very interested in improving the governance of the SEPA system, particularly so that consumers have their place and they know that I am concerned about this issue. Ms in 't Veld said: why does it need so much time? You know, Ms in’t Veld, that the Commission wanted to move faster and we three (the Commission, Parliament and the Council) are working together. We therefore had to find a compromise which I believe is fair but nonetheless dynamic. Mr Giegold recalled that we have set an end-date for the euro area for 2014, as did Mr Karas just a moment ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say to Mr Giegold and Ms Ţicău that this task that we are speeding up for SEPA is linked to another task on which the Commission has just presented an action plan with regard to e-commerce. This gives me the opportunity to tell Ms Ţicău that we will work on some extremely technical issues which concern online consumers in terms of e-invoicing, electronic signatures and payment security. I am currently working in great detail with my colleagues Mr Dalli and Ms Kroes on all of these technical obstacles to encourage the development of e-commerce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Chountis made a reference, which I understand, to the serious situation and difficulties facing his fellow Greek citizens. I will not, at this stage, return to today’s debate on the efforts we must all make to turn things around. I believe simply, Mr Chountis, that your country, which I know well and which I respect, is one of those countries in the EU which is most interested in good economic integration so as to facilitate payments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your country has foundations and that is why we must trust its ability to recover from its difficulties through its own effort and through the very important solidarity effort led by all European countries. However, when we look at Greece’s economic fundamentals, particularly in terms of tourism, tourism development and trade, it can be seen that Greece is one of the countries which is most interested in proper integration into the single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Martin mentioned the question of refunds for ordinary automatic direct debits. This text has already responded to this issue. What more can we do, Mr Martin? This is an issue that I am determined to examine, as you wished, within the framework of revising the directive on payments and their consequences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Gauzès, as always, asked very pertinent questions and one question in particular which angers people with regard to multilateral interchange fees. I think I can say that we have presented a text which offers a fair solution, which provides for the eventual removal of these fees, which are not favourable to consumers as they entail certain hidden costs and can result in causing retail prices to rise and which are often paid by direct debit — I am thinking about water and electricity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, Mr Gauzès, the text recognises that banning these flat-rate multilateral fees applied in six Member States could represent a problem for some banks which have benefited from them up to now. That is why we have provided for a transition period, as you mentioned, up to 2017. I would like to say, so that we are completely clear, that this has no bearing on what will be done or what should or could be done with regard to bank cards, as you yourself hoped.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Mölzer mentioned the regulation for consumers and the security that we owe them. I want to remind you that this regulation will strengthen consumers’ rights in order to allow them to limit the amount and periodicity of each automatic direct debit and block any direct debit which benefits specified individuals or companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the payment service provider will check each direct debit if the corresponding mandate does not provide for the right to a refund. What I have just said is a little complicated but it confirms, Mr Mölzer, the desire to establish better security for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I fully understood Mr Stoyanov’s question on the domestic case of internal direct debits within a country. Mr Stoyanov, as I have no answer to your question, I will send you a written answer after having investigated the point that you raised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Paška, Ms Băsescu and Mr Silvestris highlighted the savings this project represents for consumers and businesses and they are quite right. Ms Flašíková Beňová mentioned the framework in favour of competitiveness and I think that she too is right.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I should like to thank Mr Karas for emphasising the added value it represents. This is now the third point we have discussed just today which represents progress and added value for the internal market, as Mr Karas said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to say to Mr Zemke that the project concerns all payments in euro within the European Union and not only in euro area countries. This project concerns all payments in euro within the European Union, not only countries that are currently part of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to finish, Madam President, by mentioning Ms Essayah’s work and I would like to thank her again for the quality of her report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">substitute author. – Madam President, Commissioner, I am sure that you know how particular and, at times, impatient jurists can be when resolving the most difficult legal problems and I must say that in the Committee on Legal Affairs even the non-jurists are impatient.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission has consulted on the question of copyright management since the mid-nineties. It has published a series of documents, communications and papers addressing this issue and these were followed by public consultations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament already called for a Community framework for collective management societies in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights in its resolution of 15 January 2004 and then in its resolutions of 13 March 2007 and 25 September 2008. In this term, Parliament repeated its calls, inter alia, in its resolution of 12 May 2011 on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries and in my own report, which was adopted on 22 September 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you specified in your communication of 24 May 2011, the coming proposal on collective management of copyright should contribute to the creation of a true digital single market. We need pan-European and multi-territorial licensing. However, we are aware of the difficulty involved in the reorganisation of repertoires that would enable a single entity to grant licences for a number of repertoires.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Collective management societies must also guarantee cultural diversity by encouraging creativity, but we know that there are linguistic and cultural barriers. Collective management societies must finally ensure that all authors are looked after and paid, from international stars to less well-known authors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How, in your proposal, do you intend to ensure a balance between this necessary modernisation of collective management on the one hand, particularly in terms of Internet use, and the protection and payment of authors in cultural diversity on the other?</p>
      <p sl="fr">My final question, Commissioner — but I think you will have been expecting it — when do you intend to submit this text to us?</p>

    <intervention id="1-135-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to thank many of you, particularly Marielle Gallo, who spoke on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs of which she is a Member, for asking me about this aspect of the future legislative proposal on collective rights management. What is at stake? Using collective management to strengthen the single market in the age of the Internet, supporting this copyright — as I said more generally earlier with regard to intellectual property — in this day and age, Ms Gallo, which, as you know, is the age of the Internet and the age of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Collective management of copyright is a complex issue. It affects the management of both online and offline rights, not only with regard to authors but also with regard to performers, actors, producers, publishers and even broadcasters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We immediately think of large management societies, such as those in charge of actual copyrights but, honourable Members, we must not forget the societies which receive payment for reproduction or resale rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we focus solely on the collective management of actual copyrights, what we are dealing with is a sector which, as Ms Gallo reminded us, represents a value of EUR 7.5 billion worldwide and EUR 4.6 billion in Europe alone for almost 100 management societies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Collective management of copyrights is complex because these management societies — around 100 in Europe — while maintaining strong roots in the various Member States and participating actively in cultural diversity in each of our Member States, must also adapt, as I mentioned just a moment ago, to the Internet and to a rapidly developing demand for multi-territorial licensing. This collective management must serve right-holders and users alike. However, it is now time for this collective management to do more for the single market as well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Turning to collective management is, first and foremost, a voluntary step, and it is also the choice that authors make most often. It allows them to obtain licences for the greatest possible number of users and for the broadest possible coverage of rights. It must protect the interests of right-holders and ensure remuneration, not only, as you said Ms Gallo, for the most well-known, the stars, but also for those who are less well-known and who have the right to the same level of protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are balances which are indeed difficult to find and the issue of collective management has divided opinion among many interested parties. The opinions and positions are often very different. Similarly, the market is developing very quickly. The needs of yesterday are no longer the needs of today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, having mentioned this complexity and these different approaches which partly explain, Ms Gallo, the amount of time I am taking to work seriously and conscientiously on this proposal, I would like to say a few words on this future proposal for a directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In its communication of 20 May 2011, which you mentioned, the Commission announced its intention not only to cover copyright management linked to online music but also to establish a foundation of common rules for all collective management societies, no matter their field. This decision was well received, particularly in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From there, we are working in this objective by broadening the scope of our future proposal. All of the interested parties have been consulted. This consultation phase ended today. I led this consultation conscientiously — I will say it again — without improvising and by listening to everyone. That is why I will be presenting this proposal for a directive on behalf of the Commission — you asked me to set a deadline — next spring.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since I have the opportunity to do so, I will tell you a little about this proposal. I asked my services to work on two aspects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first aspect concerns horizontal rules for transparency and governance. It concerns harmonised rules for transparency and governance which will be applicable, if you wish, to all collective management societies in Europe. These rules should create fair conditions for all societies and improve their functioning to the benefit of all right-holders, including those from other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, we cannot neglect the fact that each collective management society manages rights on its territory (for example, rights linked to broadcasting) not only for its own members but also for members of foreign management societies. That is the first horizontal aspect of this next future proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second aspect relates to specific rules for online music. It is related to societies which manage copyrights for online music. While ensuring a high level of transparency and a better quality of services for authors and users, we want to propose a clear legal framework, honourable Members, to facilitate the granting of multi-territorial licences for online music by management societies. These licences should also promote the pooling of repertoires in order to reduce the number of licences needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this approach, the Commission will take into account, wherever possible, the position expressed by the European Parliament in several resolutions and working papers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wanted to tell you that I am working personally with all of my teams on this matter. We will be ready in the next few months and the time which has passed, which may seem long to you, has been time well spent in order to present a good, solid, balanced text to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that our proposal will go towards speeding up the creation of this digital single market. Collective management societies will benefit from a much clearer legislative framework, which will harmonise and define the basic principles of their functioning. In the online music sector, authors will benefit from the advantages of a larger market for their work. Finally, citizens — and particularly young people — will benefit from a greater range of innovative services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the direction we are working towards on these two aspects and that is the deadline by which I believe we will be ready to present this text to you — subject to the approval of the European Commission and the College — in the next few weeks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the Commission decision to propose a directive on collective rights management, and I also welcome the open legislative process just described by the Commissioner, which included a public consultation to hear the voices and opinions of all parties involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current 2005 recommendation from the Commission has proved insufficient in regulating the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for on-line music services.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our goal is to safeguard the interests of authors in Europe and to ensure cultural diversity in a legal, fair and transparent system of competition. At present there is a climate of legal uncertainty for rights-holders, for users and especially for broadcasters, who – for instance – experience legal uncertainty as to which licensing regime would apply to their services.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the Commission proposal should include some of the following principles:</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the holders of the rights, either individuals or legal persons holding on-line rights, should be able to chose freely any collective rights managers for the management of on-line rights related to legitimate on-line music services, no matter where the rights-holder or the collective rights manager is in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, royalties collected by collective rights managers on behalf of rights-holders should be distributed fairly and without discrimination on the basis of residence or nationality or whether they are composers, performers, publishers or other categories of rights-holders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Collective rights managers should be able to provide commercial users based anywhere in the European Union with pan-European and multi-territorial licences for online users, including mobile phone users, on firm and individually negotiated terms and without discrimination among users.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, in the event of disputes, parties should have access to effective and inexpensive dispute settlement mechanisms which do not burden users with unreasonable legal costs.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, in Europe growth is now a necessity we can no longer put off.</p>
      <p sl="it">It depends also on liberalisation measures addressing the obstacles and privileges that are strangling the internal digital market as well. Among these is the need for a new copyright regime, in particular for collective rights management, given that copyright represents 7% of our European gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
      <p sl="it">Reform is urgent, Commissioner, and we have awaiting it for a long time now. It has been announced many times with deadlines and dates that have never been respected, as you have indirectly admitted. We have been waiting for this directive for over two years, just as we have been hoping that the subject of Directive 2004/48/EC on the Enforcement of Property Rights and Directive 2001/29/EC would be addressed by an up-to-date scheme of exceptions. One had hoped that it would come to pass within this parliamentary term.</p>
      <p sl="it">Yet today our debate is contaminated with ‘ideologisms’ that artificially set artists in conflict with the right of free access to the web, in a paralysing conflict that is both noxious and sterile. All this must be resolved with innovative legal and technological ideas for a new concept of artists’ rights, which begins in the first place with their management. Although interesting proposals and opinions have been put forward, no progress has been made on this idea.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Barnier, you had significant success with patents, for which I congratulate you because I hold you in high esteem. On this issue, however, you are stalling. Why? Both you and the rapporteur, Ms Gallo, have spoken of genuine difficulties which, as you have said, partly justify this delay.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem is that existing collective management companies and record companies represent powerful interests that are defending their patch. That is the main obstacle. I say no to territoriality, no to reasonable derogations, no to broad collective licences, no to incentives for new business models, no to greater transparency, no to interoperability for format shifting. All this is what makes for delay.</p>
      <p sl="it">What we need are well-fashioned reforms that do not create oligopolies capable of distorting the market, the cultural industries and small players and of stifling diversity and the cultural wealth of Europe. That is why we are hoping that this ‘spring’, awaited so earnestly by all, will finally arrive.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, the world is in the midst of a technical revolution which has essentially been positive for the people of Europe. The Internet makes services such as unlimited access to music, films and books at the click of a button possible, and someone who lives in the rural area where I grew up, in Kalix in northern Sweden, has the same access to culture as someone who lives in a big cultural city like Paris or London.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The basic principles behind our copyright legislation must still be valid in the digital age too, but we also need to have the courage to see that the new era means that some old systems have to be modernised and simplified. Collective rights management is one such system that needs to be adapted to the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Those who are to provide the digital cultural services of the future must have a simpler time of it than is currently the case. It is unreasonable for a small company to have to employ legions of lawyers to negotiate rights in 27 countries over a long period in order to be able to provide access to a broad range of European works.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need to realise that European solutions are required to tear down barriers to trade and open up opportunities for entrepreneurs. Major changes like those we are currently experiencing create nervousness and, I assume, a reflex to want to hold onto what we have instead of creating and reaching out for something better. That is how I interpret the Commission’s sluggishness in this matter. The procedure that was carried out was far too long-winded. Europe now needs political leadership which will demonstrate that we can do more and do it better. I therefore expect more of you, Commissioner Barnier, and you can be sure that I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will essentially contribute in a constructive and pragmatic way to drawing up suitable proposals for a functional internal digital market designed for the 21st century.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, good evening, Commissioner, I was somewhat surprised to hear the announcement that this dossier will, yet again, be delayed, although we do not yet know for how long, because the fact that we have absolutely nothing on the table is, in itself, surprising. We have been discussing this issue since 2005 and, since 2005, we have also had the Commission’s recommendation, which has, in fact, led to major market distortions, as a result of which small-scale rights users in Europe are coming under increasing pressure and facing numerous problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need this proposal and we need it urgently! First of all, we need it urgently because the territoriality problem must be solved. However, we have a difficulty here. The world no longer simply ends at national borders and problems are not solved with small exchange relationships; it goes beyond this. The proposal is also urgent because the rights of artists in relation to collecting societies and rights users need to be strengthened and improved. That is not happening to the same extent in all Member States and in some the situation is desperate. It is also urgent because the European Parliament’s Lévai report has answered all of Parliament’s questions, though the Commission has yet to respond to it, and because, from a global perspective, the increasing market concentration of the US giants at the expense of our European rights users is helping them grab an ever bigger share of market power. This delay is now benefiting the dinosaurs of the market and not the thing that cultural diversity in Europe needs as badly as we need water for life, namely a culture outside the mainstream, which can then fertilise this same mainstream again.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, take action, but do not pull a fast-track procedure on us.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I am joining my colleagues to call for the issue of collective management societies to be dealt with quickly. I agree with the proposals you have just made regarding the harmonisation of horizontal rules on transparency and regarding the rules on online music.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I must insist on the aim of fair remuneration for artists. Since the start of the mandate, for several years even, the issue of remuneration for artists has been mentioned exclusively in the context of infringements to intellectual property rights, making Internet users the scapegoats for artists’ lack of earnings. Yet, we are forgetting that, for each CD, for example, authors and performers only receive, on average, 6% of the sales price and that, for websites that sell music online, they receive hardly anything, around 1% per sale.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fair remuneration for artists must therefore be at the heart of our revision of collective management for the digital era. Of course, we need more transparency. In France, the Standing Monitoring Committee for management societies and distribution of rights published a damning report last year on the remuneration of the managers of these societies, for example. This committee also denounced a wave of invoices and deductions for costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Artists must be at the heart of our concerns and many voices from all of the political camps together are denouncing a system which, in the end, places more importance on intermediaries than artists — that is what Neelie Kroes said — or even an opaque, confiscatory system as the French Minister of Culture has branded it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I therefore think that, if we revise these collective management rights, our objective and our end goal must be the optimal perception of intellectual property rights. These are conditions which are not merely incidental in the fight against infringements to intellectual property rights but which represent an essential prerequisite to the respect of these rights by users.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the exaggerated reactions of sections of the public to the draft ACTA agreement have shown that the issue of intellectual property rights must be addressed. Part of the problem is the collective management of copyright. For the single market to function, it is important that it is based on the same principles throughout Europe. I expect in particular that the directive will bring an end to the practices of a number of national collecting societies. It should be borne in mind that not all authors want to be represented by such societies.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is necessary, on the basis of an analysis of best practices, to establish a means of redistributing fees for the use of original works, but above all, the legislation under preparation must be based on the reality of today. In a world where it only takes a few minutes to copy and share authors’ works, the whole concept of copyright must be reassessed, and only then can its collective management be addressed.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Romania has 12 collective management bodies which are organised and operate with the approval of ORDA (Romanian Copyright Office). Five of them deal with copyright and the other seven with neighbouring rights. The sums collected are redistributed based on the documents received from users and other criteria: common fund, background, private copying, distribution ‘basket’ and so on. The fact that, in the 2004-2009 period, the sums collected by collective management bodies rose fivefold indicates significant progress and also that copyright holders and holders of neighbouring rights are aware of the benefits they derive from joining a collective management body.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to ask the Commission what measures are envisaged by the future legislative proposal to guarantee that both copyright holders and holders of neighbouring rights (especially the least well known) have access to collective management bodies under European licences, and that consumers can have access to the works they want, in the desired language, anywhere in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, whether it be film sites, streaming portals or online music services, the distribution of creative content over the Internet is enjoying an ever larger market. However, the potential has not been exhausted yet and, compared to the United States or Asia, the EU still lags far behind when it comes to digital distribution. This kind of distribution over the Internet offers small-scale or young artists and musicians, in particular, an inexpensive method of reaching the widest possible audience. In turn, consumers get easy access to a wide range of creative content.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to tap the potential of the European creative industries, we need to create an appropriate legal framework which covers licensing, amongst other things. Collective rights management also allows artists at the smaller end of the scale to exercise their rights. It is not enough that Europe had a lot to offer historically in the fields of culture and creativity. We need to wake up to what these fields have to offer and promote this market in the digital world accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">However, I want to repeat a second time — I said it to Ms Gallo just a moment ago in my first answer — that, on an issue such as this one, taking into account of course the interests here, but also the legal complexity, the time we have taken, which has been longer than I would have liked, has been time well spent, as it has enabled us to produce an intelligent and dynamic text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Gallo, in her first question, raised the issue that some of you also mentioned in a similar way in your own questions: how, in this proposal, will we ensure a balance between the protection of authors and cultural diversity on the one hand, access to this creativity to as many people as possible and, of course, the necessary modernisation of collective management?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to remind you, honourable Members, that these collective management societies play an important intermediary role between authors and the public. There is no obligation for authors to use collective management societies — I say this to Ms Záborská in particular — it is a voluntary choice to use these societies. They play an important role and, as you and others have said, Ms Gallo, this is a difficult task at a time when societies are investing heavily to develop multi-territorial licensing. We must not underestimate this responsibility or the technical and financial obstacles for a market which is still fragile and developing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Not all copyrights societies, honourable Members, currently have the means to develop such licences and it is important that they are not left behind in the digital age. That is why I will propose measures which should allow them to choose the best means for developing multi-territorial licences within a clear legal framework which will protect the interests of their members.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Castex and Ms Lichtenberger recalled the demand for improved governance. You have given examples which have stimulated the debate and perhaps even in some cases are unusual. We need transparency and better governance. We will encourage and promote better conditions for these societies to carry out their activities but I think, like you, that the proposals we will make should improve this governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Berlinguer, I explained the deadline, I have accepted it, even though I know that you disapprove of it, and I would ask you for a few more weeks of patience so that we may arrive at this proposal. You and Ms Wikström wanted to ask me to bring this deadline forward. I will work as quickly as possible but you also wanted to recognise, Mr Berlinguer, that this time has also been used to make progress other important issues within the broad area of intellectual property. You yourself talked about the patent. I could have added orphan works management or the matter we just spoke about in this Chamber at the start of the afternoon, namely the observatory on infringements of intellectual property.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will go further with a proposal to revise the directive on the application of intellectual property rights which is being prepared. I would also remind you that I asked a man whom I respect and who was my colleague in the Commission several years ago, Mr Vitorino, to be the mediator on the sensitive issue of private copying. Finally, my services are currently analysing the reactions of all the interested parties in the Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works. We will look more closely at this matter over the summer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Wikström mentioned, among other things, if I have understood correctly, the future of small collective management societies, since not all copyrights societies are the same size. Let us not forget that most of the revenue these societies make comes from granting licences to radio stations, television channels, cable companies and record producers. All management societies will continue to grant this type of licence while being more efficient and more transparent. Furthermore, most right-holders really appreciate access to societies in their own country in their local market and in their own language. We have no intention of removing this choice, particularly in terms of languages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Wikström again and Ms Ţicău mentioned the issue of repertoires which should be accessible on a multi-territorial basis. This is important for authors, commercial users, consumers and cultural diversity in general. Even though, I will say it again, not all of these societies have the technical means to grant multi-territorial licences to the major online service providers, we will propose solutions in this text so that all repertoires are available for these licences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Macovei mentioned in particular the issue of competition in the functioning of collective management societies. Yes, honourable Members, there will be greater transparency in the functioning of these societies and more opportunities for right-holders to make an informed choice. Yes, because a common foundation will be established along with fair ground rules for the functioning of collective management societies in Europe. Following the adoption of this text which you will undoubtedly have the opportunity to improve, it will be easier for right-holders and commercial users to compare the levels of service offered by the various collective management societies. We will thereby be able to tap into all of the creative potential that exists in Europe more efficiently, as Mr Obermayer said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Záborská mentioned ACTA. I know that this is a concern. Just before in a previous debate I repeated what the Commission wanted to do with this text and confirmed that my colleague Karel De Gucht is willing to take part in all the debates scheduled here for the end of February and the beginning of March in a responsible, calmer way to discuss the issues relating to the ACTA agreement. That is as much as I can tell you on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank each and every one of you for asking me about these issues. I have told you what direction we are working towards in these two areas, which you will see again in this proposal on collective rights management in the next few weeks.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Commission has repeatedly announced in its documents a number of initiatives on collective rights management, but has not tabled any proposal as yet. At present, collective management is handled through bodies which collect royalties, but which have become an obstacle to effective copyright reform in Europe. The current problems in this area were very well highlighted in Belgium when a group of undercover reporters showed that the collective management company SABAM (Société d’Auteurs Belge – Belgische Auteurs Maatschappij) was collecting royalties for artists who do not exist. This is why I think that a timetable ought to be specified for this legislative proposal, as well as the scope of its application.</p>

    <intervention id="1-151-000" speaker_id="96779" name="Danuta Maria HÜBNER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author" nationality="Poland" birth_date="08-04-1948" birth_place="Nisko" m_state="PL">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me start by saying once again that there is no doubt that Europe needs growth. The last summit finally admitted what many of us in this House have been repeating stubbornly for years, namely that any further budget consolidation, including austerity packages, must be growth-friendly. The current forecasts are not good. If stagnation continues it will eventually lead to a deep erosion of Europe’s productive capital, human capital in particular and young human capital even more so.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are all for efforts exerted at all levels of European governance to get the most out of EU budget-supported policies. In this context, we were surprised to hear from the President of the Commission that there are EUR 82 billion of what were called ‘unspent structural funds’: EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund – which corresponds to roughly 30% of the 2007-2013 allocation – and EUR 60 billion of the ERDF and Cohesion Fund, which means more or less 22% of the current programming period’s allocation. We discovered, however, that this is not really unspent money but rather money that has not yet been spent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking more carefully into this announcement, we understand that these funds have not yet been allocated to concrete projects but that they are already committed to priorities and programmes. We also understand that allocation to projects, largely through tenders, is a process lasting until the end of the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">It could therefore be expected that most Member States would keep part of the allocation for 2012 and 2013. We also understand that the remaining 70% of ESF funding and 78% of the Cohesion and Regional Funds have either already been paid or that the relevant tenders have been completed, which means that legal commitments have been made or that projects are ongoing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our question most likely comes too early to request a fully-fledged assessment from the Commission of the scope for the potential need for reprogramming. We understand that since 2007 growth and jobs have been priorities of cohesion policy and its overarching mission. Nevertheless, we fully share the view that the potential of cohesion policy to generate growth and jobs must be fully exploited.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is worrying, however, is that the way in which this proposal – for the potential reprogramming of the funds scheduled for allocation by individual Member States to projects in the last two years of the current financial perspective – has been presented to public opinion has created false interpretations, unnecessarily undermining the image of the policy and of its real impact on growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout the crisis Parliament has supported all Commission proposals aimed at strengthening the cohesion policy’s response to the crisis. In record time we adopted the amendments to the general regulation to increase co-financing rates. We are working very closely with the Commission and the Council to create a risk-sharing facility to facilitate use of funds in countries in distress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that we are all aware that there are problems concerning the take-up of funds in some countries. We appreciate the Commission’s efforts to help countries like Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Italy in overcoming the austerity trap through the wise and efficient investment of structural funds.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-152-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Johannes Hahn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Ms Hübner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for asking this question, which has given me a good opportunity to demonstrate how much growth potential there is in regional policy. I would like to point out that regional policy, by definition, has always been targeted at growth and that will still be the case in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">In times like these, it is even more necessary than ever that we make huge investments in growth. Europe needs growth. It is very important that we strive here to head off what some experts have described as a minor potential recession. It is absolutely essential that we tackle two issues, in particular: the first is promoting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the second is tackling extremely high youth unemployment in some countries which, in some age cohorts, amounts to as much as 50%. We need to support both these areas, as they are mutually interdependent.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me give you a simple sample calculation: we have 23 million SMEs in Europe and some 23 million unemployed. To put it in simple terms, if we were able to persuade each SME to take on an additional unemployed person, man or woman, the problem of unemployment would be cured. For that reason, the informal European Council of 30 January has very rightly said that we need even greater and more targeted efforts in the coming years to promote the competitiveness of our companies and, thus, ensure growth for Europe. There can be no long-term stability without equivalent qualitative and quantitative growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Heads of State or Government have therefore proposed that we review once again those Structural Fund resources that have not yet been allocated to specific projects – EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund (ESF) and around EUR 60 billion from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) or the Cohesion Fund, to be exact – in order to ensure the optimal utilisation of growth potentials. Although it is true that, in principle, these resources have been allocated to programmes, they have not been allocated to specific projects yet. Therefore, it would certainly be a legitimate approach to say: let us look at whether we can once again improve the funding structure.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has offered to use all the expertise available to us to help, in particular, those countries where youth unemployment is at its highest. It must be permissible to exhaust all the possibilities in such critical cases. We are at your disposal. We have offered this to Member States and they have accepted the offer. We will hold very specific discussions in the coming weeks and months and they are starting in early March. However, it is up to Member States to ultimately adapt and tighten their programmes and align them with the objective of tackling youth unemployment and promoting SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this background, I am grateful to the European Parliament for its support in enabling accelerated action which, on the one hand, serves the promotion of SMEs and, on the other, has made it possible for the cofinancing rate to be increased, which will ultimately allow us to overcome liquidity bottlenecks here and there and implement, complete or finish projects. We stand ready, if need be, to adjust or adapt programmes – as we already do, day in, day out – if requested by Member States. The willingness of the Commission is there. However, I would also ask Members of the European Parliament to contribute, within your capabilities and remits, to the project of tackling youth unemployment and promoting SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening’s intervention must first and foremost clarify the matter in hand. Essentially, as Ms Hübner has stated and as has also been expressed in the questions, the point is how the European Commission can raise EUR 82 billion all at one go to help SMEs and youth unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You have spent a week and a half in the Netherlands at our invitation and we have shown you how it works out in practice. You take one euro from the European programmes and form a partnership with businesses, universities, municipal authorities and regional organisations. The balance is no longer one euro but, in the programmes, effectively four. You do this three or four years in advance, and in my country, as you have also seen, the programmes are already set up for 2012 and 2013. By then it will be too late to change, or else everyone who lays his share of the cofinancing and a great deal more on the table will wonder what happened to trust in the Government.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Considering that EUR 82 billion is about what we already had two years ago, the question is whether this represents a book-keeping approach of the ‘so much is still unspent’ type, or whether you can name the amount of space in each separate country, in France, Germany or Poland. Then we would also have some idea of what we are talking about. What disturbs me is that, next day and all the week following, the newspapers will tell of mountains of unfulfilled projects and a wide margin between regional funds and the cohesion fund. Can you state the precise dimensions of the space in which you move?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief points in response to this oral question.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Commission wants to put tackling youth unemployment at the heart of its policy. Giving hope and a future to young people is part of our remit and it is very important to us. Secondly, I also welcome the fact that the Commission is increasingly realising that, in a time of economic crisis more than ever, cuts are not the only route to success: we also need investment. In that respect, SMEs should, of course, be our topmost priority, because they create the most jobs and are very important for economic development.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, let me be very clear and open about this: it appears, from what is being said in the media, that Mr Barroso has been giving the impression that he is able to stump up EUR 82 billion for this European Union, with the throwaway comment afterwards that that money will no longer be spent as planned in the cohesion policy, anyway; we will, instead, be able to use that money right away to do precisely what we have just been talking about: namely, tackling youth unemployment and supporting SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="de">EUR 82 billion – that is almost a quarter of the total cohesion policy budget up to 2013. As far as I am aware, that money is already tied up in programmes and projects. How exactly do you intend to go about this: that is, allowing all the regions, all of a sudden, to start doing something completely different with that money and, then, because the youth unemployment figures are not so high in your neck of the woods, making some of that money available to other countries?</p>
      <p sl="de">The regions have responded to this with dismay. I have received a lot of calls from people asking me: what is going on? Is the money being taken away from us? What is the point of that? Let me give you a word of warning. The cohesion policy has really been a tremendously successful policy and one that has been extremely tangible and comprehensible to citizens. It creates trust. If we now start making vague statements like this, which create the impression that we have money left over, that our policy so far has not been adequate, or that we can rustle up a couple of billion just like that, that will not create any additional trust, but only uncertainty. Most importantly, when I consider the fact that the Council has failed to provide the full amount of funds considered necessary by the Commission and Parliament for this year’s budget negotiations and the fact that, according to the information I have received, some EUR 15 billion are needed this year for projects that have already been completed, but we only have EUR 5 billion, at the very most, at our disposal, then I really wonder how anyone can go around implying that Member States are prepared to fork out more money and allocate additional funds for the cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that we need to be careful that we actually pursue the right policy and that we offer support to countries with high youth unemployment. However, I would also like us to ensure that we do not create even more uncertainty for people in times that are difficult enough already.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I welcome the proposal made by the European Commission to redirect the funds which have not yet been allocated from the European Union’s Structural Funds towards helping SMEs and combating youth unemployment, especially as the economic crisis has greatly exacerbated these problems. It is essential that support is given to SMEs in order to achieve economic and growth and create new jobs. Member States which have not achieved a very high absorption rate of EU funds must also be able, where this is the case, to reorder their priority areas for allocating European money.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, as you are aware, this is not the first recovery measure of this kind that we have adopted. Taking the depressing example of my country’s government, which is perhaps the worst performer in Europe in terms of EU fund absorption, we can say that this financial aid has not always been used as we might have expected. This is why the effectiveness of the recovery measures depends to a large extent on national governments’ ability and readiness to create the national framework required to implement these measures successfully.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In fact, to enable us to make a fair, objective decision on the proposal that you have tabled, we need not only clear answers to all the questions which the Committee on Regional Development has submitted to you, but also some clarifications. For example, one concerns what action the European Commission is going to take to provide support and ensure that national governments which have already shown their lack of implementation of the recovery measures adopted at EU level will still manage to redistribute unallocated money quickly for specific projects targeting SMEs and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another point which I feel is extremely important is that you have focused on a list of eight Member States where the youth unemployment rate is sky-high. I wish to tell you, Commissioner, that this is a genuine problem in Romania, and we want to know, indeed, Romania’s citizens want to know whether the funds allocated to Romania will be redirected to other Member States. It would be unfortunate if this happened.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I welcome the fact that the Council has adopted Parliament’s proposals and that it wants to take action to tackle youth unemployment. The Youth Guarantee scheme proposed, or rather cited, by Mr Barroso was a proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, from the own-initiative report which they earlier submitted to this House. However, unlike him, I believe that the focus should be on disadvantaged young people, in particular. This requires decentralised action. That would be much more appropriate here. The European Social Fund (ESF) money should remain in place and be allocated anew when the relevant location deems it appropriate. I address this to Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="de">Similarly, our group supports the Council’s decision on a green economy. That, too, originated in a Verts/ALE own-initiative report, which was adopted here in the plenary by a large majority two years ago. Hence, our demand, as part of the reprogramming of Structural Funds, that we focus on the green economy in areas where initiatives are needed. SMEs are exactly the kind of enterprises for which such a line is essential, because it would make them competitive. We must not allow money to be thrown out the window just like that. We need sustainable projects, those from which the next generations will be able to profit.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, is it normal for the Commission to decide on a redeployment of funds with the Member States and for Parliament to be presented with the fait accompli?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are told that EUR 82 billion of funds have not been used and will not be used by 2013. We are being asked to take you at your word, but I would like to take a closer look. How can you be sure in 2012 that these funds will not be spent before the end of the programming period? What I want to say is that none of the regions which initially benefited from these funds should be penalised by this redeployment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, deep down, the reason behind this redeployment lies elsewhere, does it not? Is it not a case of alleviating the devastating effects of the austerity policies which are currently in place throughout the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to alleviate the effects of the crisis it would have been much wiser to use new resources. To use new resources to finance real growth policies and real youth employment policies. Within these new resources I am thinking of the financial transactions tax, which we have been calling for for a long time and which is yet to be finalised.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished that we need to keep reminding people of what is meant by structural and cohesion policy. Structural and cohesion policy is one of the key policy areas of the European Union and, by definition, it should serve the purpose of consolidating the economic and social cohesion of the Union, while at the same time promoting growth and employment, in underdeveloped regions in particular. The necessity and success of structural and cohesion policy has been demonstrated especially clearly in these years of crisis. The economic development situation in many regions would now be even bleaker had these funds not been made available.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then comes the implementation of Structural Funds on the basis of operational programmes – as has already been pointed out – in which the promotional strategy of each region is described. The European Union, Member States and regions work in partnership here and thus create real added value for Europe. The success of structural and cohesion policy is based on the reliability of programming and funds which have either already been made available or are in the process of being made available.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am, therefore, very surprised that, time and again, some Member States, and even the Commission – as we now see – attempt to make use of Structural Fund resources as a money box for all kinds of topical policy initiatives. That is not consistent with the meaning and purpose of cohesion policy and, in addition, it causes concern amongst players in the regions who are already working to achieve objectives on the basis of long-term strategies and contracts. It is true that tackling youth unemployment and commitment to economic growth are important goals. However, they will only be achieved if the cooperative partnership between the regions, Member States and the Commission is maintained and if players in the regions continue to be involved. After all, only they know what needs to be done in their regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Structural and cohesion policy is the unifying, cooperative, supportive bond of action between individual policy levels in the European Union. It reflects the solidarity of Europe on the ground, in the regions, and it should not be recklessly abandoned in favour of political quick fixes.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know that without young people there is no future, and we are also sure that, with high rates of youth unemployment, Europe may become unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must provide solutions. These solutions will not materialise through labour reforms such as the one approved last Friday in my country, which will bring our young people even greater job insecurity and destroy their rights. The fact is that Europe has a youth unemployment rate of close to 23%. In my country, Spain, unemployment affects 49% of young people, many of whom are educated, trained and talented, and who are increasingly saying how tired and fed up they are with the lack of solutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">We agree on the urgent need to approve measures to stimulate the recruitment of young people and to help small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those set up by young people. That is why I believe that we must ensure that training matches the requirements of the labour market as a matter of priority. We must realise that an education system that is fairer in terms of the quality of education and that does away with the differences between public and state-subsidised private education will help to boost creativity and innovation, thereby increasing students’ entrepreneurial spirit, specialisation and mobility.</p>
      <p sl="es">Could the Commission explain how the EUR 10.7 billion that it estimates is owed to Spain will be distributed between the various funds? With regard to the European Social Fund, what percentage of the EUR 82 billion that is still to be allocated will be assigned to this fund? What is this percentage in Spain specifically? Lastly, how does the Commission plan to integrate regional and local authorities and social partners into the action plans?</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, I expect fast, decisive and viable action from the Commission, because we do not have a single day to waste.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was an own-initiative report by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which pointed out that the absorption capacity of certain Member States was not very high. As rapporteur on that report, I pointed to the causes of that situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is now necessary that the Commission take appropriate action here. We will also support the Commission in finally taking action in problem countries – in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and in southern Italy. A reallocation of resources towards small and medium-sized enterprises, dual vocational training and tackling youth unemployment is absolutely the right course to take. That has to be our starting point. However, the vital thing is that capacities are built up, if we are to solve these problems. The impression the citizens of Europe have is that – as in Greece – all-out austerity is not working and that the government simply agrees measures which then remain unimplemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is crucial that, to use a car analogy, we do not put our foot down on the accelerator only to find that nothing happens. Now we need to engage a gear, so that the engine can provide thrust to the wheels! After all, we need to take action to develop a real economy: that is, to improve competitiveness, so that the problem is tackled at the root.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, Europe currently has the best-educated and best-trained generation of young people of all time. However, this is also the generation with the lowest employment levels and poorest-quality jobs. We in Europe’s public authorities are doing something very wrong.</p>
      <p sl="es">At a time when we are discussing a reform of cohesion policy, the unemployment rate, in particular the youth unemployment rate, could become a future indicator aside from income.</p>
      <p sl="es">The future cohesion policy must be about creating employment. There is nothing more urgent, particularly in countries in which half of all young people under the age of 25 have no choice but unemployment. They want high-quality contracts, stable contracts, with fair salaries – the total opposite of the course being taken by some Member States, such as Spain, where antisocial labour reforms are underway.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the best-trained generation for years, but their options are mini-jobs, bad jobs, unemployment or even emigration. They expect more from us, and we cannot use the crisis as a scapegoat or an excuse for introducing labour reforms that virtually mean austerity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Meanwhile, many small and medium-sized enterprises have had to close, precisely because of this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am still somewhat astonished. After years of Mr Barroso and his colleagues in the Council having pursued a policy of austerity, and successfully having forced upon everyone unemployment and cuts in social security spending under the umbrella of the crisis, they have now discovered the unemployed. As important as this subject certainly is, it sounds like mockery if you see the promotional film for it on EuroparlTV, which talks about additional funding. I have a simple question for you, Mr Hahn, namely, where in your petty cash can you find EUR 82 billion? We all know that everything is actually already planned up to 2013 – and we are not far from the point where that door will be closing.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not be dealing in tricks, nor should we be talking as if everyone could now receive the same funding or indeed adequate funding. Quite specifically, what is the situation with Ireland, for example, which, as we all know, has already spent all of its resources? What advice do you have for the Irish Government when it comes to combating youth unemployment?</p>
      <p sl="de">It is self-evident that we need to make major efforts in employment policy in order to reduce youth unemployment. That much is clear, but we also need real money to be able to do so. We also need to get behind it. Furthermore, there are, of course, other things that we need, such as more sensible protection against dismissal, or truly decent work.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would just like to reiterate what it is that we do not need, namely macro-economic conditionality over the forthcoming subsidy period. That is something that we should not even look into. We are observing at this point in time what that means.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the current economic situation and the high levels of youth unemployment demand decisive action, so I am very pleased that the European Commission and President Barroso have recognised this problem and are proposing a reprogramming of the Structural Funds in order to provide support to small and medium-sized enterprises and to combat youth unemployment. However, the question that presents itself is whether we are able to do this quickly, effectively and efficiently and also whether the sum of EUR 82 billion mentioned by the President is actually available. I think that the fundamental question is: will Member States want to reprogramme Structural Funds?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today on average over 20% of young people living in the European Union are unemployed. For this reason I would like to emphasise that, in the context of reducing unemployment, it is important not just to use the funds that are available, but also to use them effectively. It is important that EU funds allocated for raising qualifications do in fact support high-quality training that provides young people with skills that are required in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Small and medium-sized enterprises play – or should play – an important role in the creation of new jobs. Statistics show that only 3% of them are leaders in innovation. Many entities decide not to apply for EU funds because the application process is long-winded and the procedures are complicated and not altogether transparent. I think we would all agree with the statement that efficient functioning and growth in the SME sector is an exceptionally important factor in GDP growth, in the fight against unemployment and in economic stability. I also think, Commissioner, that thousands of European Union citizens are eagerly awaiting today’s discussion, so I would like to ask you a question: in practice, what does support for SMEs mean and what would be the nature of the attempts to reduce youth unemployment? How can we make these effective, as today we are already combating unemployment, but it continues to rise.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, one of the most serious consequences of the European crisis is the very high rate of youth unemployment that we are experiencing now and that in certain Member States of the EU is approaching 50%, as some speakers have mentioned during this sitting.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Back in the election campaign ahead of the European elections in 2009, Mr Barroso promised that the fight against youth unemployment would be the single most important task for him and the Commission he wanted to lead. So far, we have not seen very much of this. There are enormous expectations and an enormous need to do something about the fact that we are ignoring the young generation that is to govern Europe in the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Now there is suddenly nearly EUR 100 billion on the table, and it would be fantastic if this money could be used. It is late coming, but it would be extremely important. The question is why this money has to be taken from the Structural Funds of all places. Are the supporters of cohesion policy right down at the bottom of the career ladder and therefore the easiest to pick on? There are other parts of the EU budget that could donate funds without needing to interfere with the work of the Structural Funds. The question of how long it might take before this could be in place is also relevant. The young people of Europe are desperate. This needs to happen quickly.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, there is a contradiction here because, while we are debating social cohesion, a policy is being promoted, for which the Commission is partly responsible, which is causing an increase in unemployment and the closure of numerous small and medium-sized enterprises in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="el">As you know, unemployment among young people in Greece now stands at 48% and unemployment among the population as a whole stands at 20.9%. Under the new Memorandum, young people under 25 years of age are being forced to work at wages reduced by 32% and, therefore, a 25-year-old is forced to enter the labour market at a wage of EUR 440 a month for an eight-hour day. Under such circumstances, young people are, of course, tending to leave the country.</p>
      <p sl="el">Is there a real cohesion policy? In other words, are these policies that we debate here on social cohesion and youth employment in keeping with the measures being promoted under this new Memorandum? The big issue here is: are there unused resources? Can they be diverted towards creating jobs for young people in Greece and helping small and medium-sized enterprises or are new resources needed?</p>
      <p sl="el">Could we please examine the policies being applied to address the fiscal crisis in Greece alongside other policies, namely social cohesion and the economy, especially the green economy?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the Commission and the governments are now promising to reprogramme the Structural Funds, in order to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to create jobs. However, it should be remembered that, at the end of last year, the Commission also decided to suspend allocations from the Structural Funds to countries which did not meet their deficit or debt targets. One does not have to be a genius to realise that either the promise or the punishment will be forthcoming, but not both at the same time. As such, Commissioner, I would like to ask you a direct question: is the decision to suspend allocations from the Structural Funds still in force, or has it been frozen or cancelled? In other words, will Greece, Portugal, Ireland and other countries still be able to make use of the funds to which they are entitled, if they do not hit the targets imposed upon them by you and the Commission? Please answer this question, Commissioner. As you can imagine, we in Portugal are tired of promises.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, according to Eurostat, the European Union currently has around 23 million people unemployed; that is 8 million more than in 2008, with the majority of them young people who cannot find a foothold in the labour market. Youth unemployment rates in the European Union are at 20.4%, whereas in the US it is around 17.5% and in Japan it is 9.3%. As such, there is an urgent need to adopt new public measures to stimulate economic growth, generate wealth and create jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Of the EUR 82 billion that the Commission announced for the period between 2007 and 2013, Portugal has received only around EUR 3 billion from the Structural Funds; that is, some 14% of the total to which the country was entitled, which has still not been duly allocated. It is essential to channel these funds into boosting economic activity, by effectively supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, by stepping up research and innovation, by stimulating international activity and by encouraging entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the labour market, it is vital to make use of this opportunity to encourage companies to employ young people, to enhance vocational training, to adapt higher education to the real needs of the labour market and to boost the performance of the public authorities. The question that must be asked is this: what concrete measures does the Commission recommend that the Member States implement? Will this be the right solution in order for certain Member States, including Portugal, to be able to move from a phase of austerity into a new phase of economic growth which can generate wealth and jobs?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, this initiative comes from a good place. Work on education and training must be a priority when it is not only essential for the employability of our young people but also an investment for the future, a gauge of our ability to maintain dynamic and sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being said, I am still extremely dubious about how consistent European action is overall. If the EU is not capable of implementing real solutions for growth, if it is still obsessed with punitive austerity, sterile austerity, austerity for austerity’s sake, there will be no growth for small and medium-sized enterprises, no jobs for young people and all of our efforts will be in vain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Similarly, if the fight against youth unemployment is our priority, how do you explain your proposal to reduce certain funds dedicated to the outermost regions by almost 50%, Commissioner? These regions where youth unemployment is at over 60%, these regions which you promised to protect, find themselves being sanctioned more than any others. Where is the consistency? Where is the justice? This decision is unacceptable and we are against.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, first of all I would like to say to you again that we are just fine here in Strasbourg. This is a message I try to get across every time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, President Barroso’s proposal had the virtue of showing that the European Union, through the Structural Funds, has significant public investment instruments at its disposal. In these difficult times for national public finances that is worth highlighting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">According to the President of the Commission, EUR 82 billion, which have not been allocated for the 2007–2013 period, could be redirected towards support for SMEs and the fight against youth unemployment. Like our Chair, Danuta Hübner, I too wonder where this amount has come from. It would seem that President Barroso is referring to money which has not yet been programmed but which has already been divided between the Member States and allocated to programmes which are in operation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have my doubts about the interest in redirecting this money. There is a risk of disrupting the programming of funds without having any real benefit on the ground. Furthermore, as I recall, Structural Funds are already heavily involved in supporting SMEs and youth employment. This must continue to be a priority for the next programming period.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am taking this opportunity to remind my colleague, Mr Omarjee, who spoke about this a few moments ago, that President Sarkozy has decided to implement the financial transactions tax in France, in case he had not noticed.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Europe will not recover from the current crisis unless it manages to help young people find a job or start a business. A young workforce is required to support the pensions system in an ageing European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the latest data from ANOFM, the Romanian National Employment Agency, more than 100 000 people under the age of 30 are currently out of work. I should mention that the biggest difficulties are encountered in getting the first job. The Romanian State’s annual expenditure on this is actually EUR 1.17 billion. This is why I welcome funding and support for young entrepreneurs in any form. However, the Commission must clarify whether it intends to reduce the amounts allocated to countries with low absorption rates. On the other hand, I think that these are precisely the Member States which require the most support to boost their capacity to use EU funds. Reducing the cofinancing rate is an option with this purpose in mind.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also call on the Commission to submit an action plan for using the EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund in apprenticeship and training programmes. I should stress that clarification is also required as to the method to be used for offering young entrepreneurs guarantees from EU funds.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, undoubtedly our biggest challenge is to create jobs for our youth all across Europe, and to encourage growth and development in the economy. If this scheme helps us, we will have done a great job.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Members have already questioned the desirability and the practicality of moving funds from the Structural Funds into this scheme, and I also noted Ms Ernst’s question as to how Ireland, a country which has already utilised its Structural Funds, can avail itself of a scheme like this?</p>
      <p sl="ga">Nevertheless, assuming this can happen, EUR 82 billion is a lot of money. It is actually EUR 3 billion per Member State, with EUR 1 billion left over, and it can make a big difference to the situation we find ourselves in.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Assuming it can happen, however, I would appeal for a few things. Number one: flexibility, because without flexibility I can see State agencies gobbling the money up and the scheme not being as effective as it should be. So the private sector must be allowed to get involved in terms both of education and training and of providing opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In addition, the training has to be practically based, not the formulaic, off-the-shelf training that we often get from State agencies – and I saw this in particular in relation to FAS (the Training and Employment Authority) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Finally, I would appeal for the message to be communicated to the State agencies, especially local authorities, and to young people themselves, that this is going to happen, that they can avail themselves of it and that through it they can get jobs.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conclusions of the recent European Council and the work that is being done at by the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, where the guidelines for the 2013 Budget are being discussed, have clearly shown the harmony that exists between the European institutions on the priorities to be given to policy action by the European Union. The institutions agree on the need to encourage growth also by combating unemployment, above all youth unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this sense, I welcome the declaration on the use of the EUR 82 billion in the financial framework 2007-2013 for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which today form the true backbone of our economy. As has been demonstrated by the statistics provided by the Commission itself, we owe 85% of the new jobs created between 2002 and 2010 to SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it is clear that we need to make a joint effort, through synergy and cooperation between the European budget and national budgets, in order to focus and redirect the resources available to individual Member States towards the stated priorities, especially towards those measures and programmes capable of having a concrete impact on this problem and turning things around for our young people.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am therefore asking the Commissioner to specify the actions, programmes and budget lines – in addition to those more clearly relating to small and medium-sized enterprises – which he considers need to be enhanced in order to reduce the level of youth unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the proposal announced by the Commission is generous. I have no doubt that it is inspired by the best intentions. However, the Commission is aware that it is not about blocked or wasted money but about money for infrastructure, for instance, for large-scale projects outlined at the start of the financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Of course, a large proportion of funds are targeted actually at small businesses and youth programmes. In any case, this kind of reallocation may offer an opportunity to those Member States wishing to invest more in these two areas. However, this must remain an individual option for each state, decided on a voluntary basis.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Setting up a fund to be managed by the European Commission is not a solution. The mere suspicion that funds could be reallocated between Member States is a risky issue. The right solution is to provide greater flexibility in reordering priorities internally. At the same time, we should not forget that the biggest obstacle preventing the effective use of EU funds is the lack of resources for ensuring national and private cofinancing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to compliment my colleague Ms Hübner for bringing forward a very topical and timely oral question. The economic crisis has absolutely devastated youth employment. The statistics are frightening: youth employment stands at less than 10% in only three countries: Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. Elsewhere it is more dramatic. In the Baltic for example, in Ireland, in Greece and in Slovakia unemployment among young people stands at 30% or above, and in Spain it is more than 40%. This is a brain drain that we cannot afford.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are an ageing Community; we need young people, we need a workforce that is able to meet the challenges from the low-cost economies. In order to end that brain drain we need to provide opportunities for our young people. They are young, they are intelligent – many of them educated – but we must be able to keep them here.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my own country we have an economic crisis, which, thankfully we are getting out of. But the vast majority of young people educated in Ireland, many of them with third-level degrees, many with master’s degrees, some of them with doctorates, have gone to Australia or to Canada and, in many cases, unfortunately, they will not come back.</p>
      <p sl="en">A lot of them paid tribute – or at least lip service – to the SME sector. And of course this is a vital component which, in my country accounts for 60% of jobs. But I fully concur with my colleague Seán Kelly: if you are introducing schemes make them flexible, and in the name of heaven do not strangle them with bureaucracy and red tape. Too many excellent programmes and schemes coming from Europe have died the death because of a lack of flexibility and because of red tape.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question we are debating this evening is of paramount importance, because it concerns young people, the most important resource of the European Union, which is at the mercy today of unemployment and insecurity, not only in countries with serious fiscal problems, such as my country, Greece, but in other countries too, in both the north and south.</p>
      <p sl="el">Young people are being forced to leave their home for other countries, both inside and outside the European internal market. Strengthening businesses is the best method because, on the one hand, it is businesses which can absorb the talents of young people in Europe with innovative ideas and a high level of education and, on the other hand, young people can, at the same time, develop their own creative activities. The Structural Funds must help here, because they are the basic tool we have for a Europe which is short of solidarity mechanisms and mechanisms to react directly to the crisis and solve the problems.</p>
      <p sl="el">At this point, I should like to ask some questions, Commissioner. Will the EUR 82 billion invested in this direction be accompanied, under the action plans, by flanking policies? Often the obstacle is not the lack of resources; it may be of an administrative or legislative nature. Investments are also needed in additional sectors, such as research and development of technology and innovation. I should also like to ask if this redirection of resources will be accompanied by flexibility. There are areas with serious structural problems which require immediate solutions which are properly designed and focus on them. Other areas suffer from emergency disasters. In my country, Greece, will Ileia, which is a ‘special area’, be able, for example, to benefit from such a flexible and immediate programme?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Mr Barroso’s proposal that the Member States redirect the money still to be allocated under the EU Structural Funds into helping small and medium-sized enterprises and combating youth unemployment has caused some doubts and even uncertainty in many Member States in connection with the need to redirect resources from the funds to other programmes. It is true that the current state of EU fund use is, on average, about a third of the EU funds for the programming period 2007–2013. The implementation of policies during the last year, 2011, gained speed, however, and at least two-thirds of the allocated resources, and in some cases the total amount of available resources, have been legally contracted, that is to say, the funds guarantee a constant supply of resources to support investments in these difficult times, and the Member States naturally have an interest in ensuring that these resources really are used.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, I am addressing you once again because, to be honest, I find the situation in the area of training enormously worrying. We are spending millions of euros on ineffective training. Statistically it looks good, because part of the funds are being used. The companies that provide training are happy because their employees are not being made redundant, as there is no lack of unemployed people to take part in training. Often the unemployed are given financial incentives to take training courses. After the courses they do not go back on the labour market because the training courses do not provide unemployed people with qualifications that are appropriate or needed in the market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have a question that relates to this: Commissioner, please tell me – if such research exists – how much does it cost to get one unemployed person back onto the labour market and what is the relationship between European funds invested and the number of jobs created?</p>

This is good because this new treaty does not include a single provision in favour of growth and employment while, on the other hand, you have this declaration, which you have today been charged with putting in place. When you are looking for good ideas to encourage youth employment, I would invite you to turn your attention to Parliament’s work, since we have drafted a report on youth employment in which I think you will find some good proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the use of the Structural Funds, we are still being bombarded with contradictions which are sparking debate. On the one hand, we want to mobilise Structural Funds to offset the golden rule but, aside from that, we want to use them to sanction the Member States.

      <p sl="fr">Then, when we are discussing fundamental financial perspectives, President Barroso’s movement questions us.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Council has undertaken to provide guidelines on Member States’ economic and employment policies in March, with particular emphasis on increasing competitiveness. It is important for the European Union funds available to be channelled more effectively into growth and employment, but while remaining within the ceiling limits agreed for each Member State and without jeopardising the implementation of the scheduled development programmes. Member States must allocate, as a matter of priority, funds for stimulating employment, especially among young people, and for boosting the financing of the economy, in particular SMEs. Specific support must be given to Member States going through the process of fiscal consolidation as the economic crisis has also triggered a major social crisis in these states.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, a huge number of citizens in Romania are not eligible for either unemployment benefit or any other form of social welfare. This is why we recommend that the rate of employment is used as an indicator, rather than the rate of unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the announcement of the reprogramming of the Structural Funds needs to be clarified and explained. This announcement is part of a rhetorical exercise seeking to obscure the disastrous effects of the last informal European Council’s decisions. To speak of growth and youth unemployment at the same meeting that institutionalises recessive policies of so-called ‘austerity’, and advocates more of the liberalisation and attacks on labour laws that are facilitating redundancies in Portugal is much more than a rhetorical exercise: it is supreme hypocrisy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The President of the Commission announced that EUR 82 billion was available for the Member States as a whole for this reprogramming. The Portuguese people will be paying 40% of this total, or EUR 34 billion, in interest to the IMF and the EU under the pact of aggression being perpetrated against the country. More than reprogramming, what is needed is to substantially increase the Structural Funds, so as to realise solidarity rather than producing insulting propaganda. What is needed is an end to policies which stifle small and medium-sized enterprises and which raise youth unemployment to unprecedented levels. What is needed is an end to the intolerable process of extortion of natural resources associated with IMF and EU programmes.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, young people need work; we can leave the politics until later. I therefore welcome the prompt response of the European Commission to the current situation in the labour market, where several EU countries have seen a sharp rise in youth unemployment. The proposal to support with additional funds small and medium-sized enterprises and projects that encourage the employment of young people are the right steps to halt and reverse the alarming situation where, in some countries, youth unemployment exceeds 30% and, in two countries, it is even approaching 50%.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If young people do not acquire working habits after completing their education, it is very likely that they will give up looking for work in the future and will join the community of people living off social benefits. Who will create pensions is a question that probably does not interest many people – it is the Structural Funds that are important. I therefore welcome the European Commission’s initiative of increasing support for small and medium-sized enterprises and, in conjunction supporting projects that promote youth employment, addressing this serious social problem through the flexible use of the available funds.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the purpose of the proposal made by President Barroso is to break the deadlock of the current economic crisis by implementing measures aimed at strengthening SMEs economically and reducing youth unemployment. The measures for redistributing the unspent sums must take into account the principle of subsidiarity provided for under the Treaty by respecting the powers of local and regional authorities with regard to using EU support. In actual fact, the question which has caused a stir and awaits a response is simple: can a Member State lose the funds initially envisaged following this redistribution process?</p>
      <p sl="ro">The main role of cohesion policy is to narrow the disparities between regions. Applying redistributions as part of the financing instruments may produce immediate, concrete results. However, the Commission must provide clarification regarding the framework for applying the proposal and compliance with the main objective of cohesion policy. The solution for redirecting the EUR 82 billion must take into account aspects relating to increasing the financing programmes’ flexibility, facilitating access to funding and improving the beneficiaries’ administrative capacity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the proposal made by President Barroso to redirect money available from the Structural Funds towards supporting our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and stimulating employment, in particular youth employment, could not be more welcome, especially for economies being subjected to robust austerity measures, such as the Portuguese economy. With the agreement on external intervention and the major difficulties in financing the economy through the banking system, particularly for our SMEs, this proposal is especially pertinent to regions like the Azores. Such regions, which have high uptake and make effective use of funds but are affected by national recessions, could have a real opportunity here to stimulate their economies through SMEs and the vital contribution of a generation of young people who are better trained than ever. That would be the best solution for growth and employment which we could achieve with these funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What we need to know, Commissioner, is how we will be able to access these funds in practice, and how our regions will participate in the reprogramming.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, good evening, Commissioner. Against the darkness of the radical austerity measures, these initiatives to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and above all to combat youth unemployment, represent a necessary ray of light. Like you, Commissioner, I am an Austrian, and it was the Austrian Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who presented the European youth initiative in the European Council. Youth unemployment is very low in Austria, thank goodness. One reason for that is our system of dual training, but the main reason is that there is a fundamental political commitment in Austria that young people should be able to rely on the fact that their training is secure, that their employment is secure.</p>
      <p sl="de">It therefore strikes me as the right approach for the European Union to now aim to implement a European training and employment guarantee. It is absolutely the right course to take to dedicate EUR 10 billion of European Social Fund (ESF) resources which have not yet been specifically allocated to creating 2 million jobs and training places for young people by the end of 2013, and to do so with radically simplified administrative terms and with a reduced cofinancing rate of 10%. However, I do ask, Commissioner, that you pay close attention to ensuring that this money is not merely moved from one trouser pocket to another.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in his statement at the informal Council meeting last month, President Barroso introduced the concept of action teams that would develop plans at a local level to alleviate youth unemployment. The action teams are to be established in the eight worst Member States, which includes Ireland of course, on a pilot basis and would explore ways of using the funding that could be reprogrammed from the social and regional funds of that Member State for projects to alleviate youth unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot afford cuts to current worthy Structural Fund projects in order to introduce new programmes. We need additional funding streams to help tackle this problem.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this debate has shown that Members of this House possess an excellent knowledge of the operation and functioning of the Structural Funds. Speaking as the competent Commissioner, I can tell you that that is a very pleasant conclusion to be able to draw.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, the debate also shows that it is clear, all in all, that the Structural Funds represent a very comprehensive and effective instrument, indeed the most comprehensive and effective instrument bar none at European level, for appropriately tackling European concerns and goals. Honourable Members, I ask you to consider President Barroso’s proposal as a very vigorous wake-up call – something that is a necessity given the volatile situation, especially when it comes to youth unemployment. It goes without saying that it was, and is, absolutely clear to him, and to everyone else, what the ground rules are when it comes to the Structural Funds. The point here, however, is simply drawing attention to the fact that a total of around EUR 80 to 82 billion is still not, as things stand, directly allocated to projects. As a result, it is therefore legitimate and more than reasonable to ask whether there is scope for refocusing by means of looking into whether monies that have not yet been specifically allocated to projects – although of course they have been allocated to regions – could be better utilised through some redeployment in the regions with a focus on promoting small and medium-sized enterprises and in particular on creating jobs for young people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us not forget that the bulk of the Operational Programmes were debated, agreed and adopted in 2005 and 2006 against the backdrop of a very different economic situation. It is therefore both necessary and appropriate to ask, given the current situation, whether there is scope for a really focused fine-tuning here. That is why the Commission has offered to hold discussions with the competent parties in the Member States concerning what possibilities there may be for action – and there are already action teams on the ground in each of the eight countries with the highest rates of youth unemployment which will be in place until the end of February. We in the Commission will be providing an initial oral report on these discussions in early March.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would invite you to bear in mind, however, that very extensive preliminary work has been done under the area of responsibility of my fellow Commissioner László Andor – from the point of view of ‘youth opportunities’ – with the aim of bringing forward proposals about everything that can possibly be done when it comes to combating youth unemployment. Precisely these proposals are now to be tailored in the discussions with the Member States in order to develop solutions that could work in each individual region and sub-region in order to bring about an improvement of the situation. That said, it is fair to mention at this point that we cannot expect to make everything better overnight. The point, however – and this is a call to arms that I am happy to endorse – is that now is very much the time to act. Initiatives need to be put in place. I hope that everyone will pull together in the way that was evident from all the contributions to the debate today. I am convinced that we could achieve the first discernible successes specifically when it comes to combating youth unemployment in Europe in just a few weeks’ time.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Undoubtedly, it is a good proposal to allocate extra funding to efforts to tackle youth unemployment. The biggest difficulty small businesses have is in accessing sources of credit, and one in five young people in the EU is unemployed. I would, however, be interested in hearing the Commission’s response to the issue of the EUR 82 billion still to be allocated to the Structural Funds and how that figure was reached. My understanding was that all Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period were already allocated to Member States and to certain targeted actions and therefore it is a surprise that there is still money to be allocated. Small businesses and local and regional groups often contact me about obtaining funding from the Structural Funds for worthwhile projects. In the majority of cases, authorities reply that the money has all been spent. It must be properly explained where that EUR 82 billion comes from and why worthwhile projects which have the potential to generate employment are being refused outright.</p>

      <p sl="en">Youth unemployment is exacerbated by inward migration absorbing jobs from the bottom up. UK youth unemployment stands at 22.3%. It increased from 575 000 in 2004 to 1 016 000 in 2011, a rise of 450 000, while over the same period 600 000 EU migrants entered the UK. The Commission wants to allocate EUR 82 billion unspent Structural Funds to youth unemployment – money corresponding to as yet unused budgets earmarked for programmes that depend upon funding – shifting resources without an impact assessment or guaranteed results. Unemployment is a fluid entity relying upon job creation. Job creation relies upon private sector growth. Private sector growth needs inward investment, trade opportunities and production flexibility: all are stifled by EU bureaucracy and marred by trading partners’ economic uncertainty. The Commission wants to divert funding from programmes construed to boost local economies towards training without guaranteed employment at the end. Whilst I support stimulating the labour market through skills development, the best way to mitigate youth unemployment is to ascribe localised investment to the labour market as a whole, rather than reducing investment flexibility through targeted policy making. Job creation requires dynamic development Member States are best equipped to deal with autocratically, via idiosyncratic programmes catering for particular portfolios of industries and demographic patterns.</p>

      <p sl="en">According to Eurostat 21.4% of young people in Europe are unemployed, 28% of those are long-term unemployed. In the last ten years the number has been in the region between 15 and 20%. The Commission estimates that 21% costs society today EUR 2 billion per week or 1% of the EU’s economic output. These are mere figures and do not portray the real tragedy among young people who face serious difficulties finding any job.</p>
      <p sl="en">The informal Council of 30 January has agreed to re-allocate funds from the structural and cohesion funds to fight high youth unemployment, especially focusing on the most affected countries such as Spain with 46% and Ireland and Portugal facing rates around 29%. The Member States together with the Commission must rapidly work out a concrete re-allocation plan, to be presented to and discussed with all actors involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is crucial to create new flexible job schemes, additional quality apprenticeship and traineeship possibilities both for young people who enter the job market, but also for those who need the opportunity to re-enter.

      <p sl="ro">The decision to redirect the unused Structural Funds to help SMEs and combat youth unemployment is totally inspired, as SMEs are the backbone of the European economy and young people a precious resource, while also being one of the most vulnerable groups in society. The younger generation is a dwindling resource, with estimates that the proportion they currently represent of 20% will drop to 15% by 2050. This means that we have a duty to create more opportunities for young people in the areas of education and employment. In fact, a basic tool for achieving the objectives proposed on this is the cohesion policy. If, at the moment, reprogramming funds for 2012 and 2013 is not such a simple task and may have more negative than positive effects, I strongly recommend Member States to focus much more attention in the forthcoming programming period on young people and to include in the national programmes’ structure well-financed axes, specially aimed at youth employment.</p>

      <p sl="it">The debate initiated by the question from the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) on reprogramming the Structural Funds to better combat youth unemployment and help SMEs has dispelled any doubts around this question. The aim of supporting small enterprises and promoting youth employment is of course one that we can all support, but it risks being just words unless the Commission makes it clear what measures and programmes it intends to implement and identifies the budget line to be drawn from. The EUR 82 billion on which the Commission bases its proposal are resources that have been allocated to the Member States and not yet spent, but they are mostly already committed. The concern that these resources could be taken away from national and regional programmes at the behest of the Commission has been decisively laid to rest by Mr Hahn, who, recognising that Parliament’s remarks were well founded, has announced that the choice to reprogramme the expenditure will be left to the Member States and that the funds will remain available to individual countries.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The European Commission’s step to redirect the money still to be allocated under the EU Structural Funds into helping SMEs and combating youth unemployment is to be welcomed. It is likely that this EUR 82 million injection will help combat youth unemployment, finding ways that would help to rapidly reduce the level of unemployment among young people. It is excellent that we are discussing efforts to develop practical opportunities or incentives for employers to employ young people. However, this financial injection and momentary attention are far from being a panacea. Even now, when youth unemployment is a hot topic on the political agenda, we need to search for targeted measures that would be truly effective in the lively and dynamic EU market. For some years we have been saying that we need to strengthen links and promote cooperation between the business and education sectors in order to reduce the gap between them. This gap between business and education is precisely the main reason for the huge rate of youth unemployment: employers continually stress that young people lack specific abilities and practical skills, while their pay expectations do not reflect reality. It is also a concern that in the EU education system we do not put enough emphasis on entrepreneurship education and the abilities to create jobs as well as take them up. I would like to believe that the European Commission experts who have begun consultations with the Member States will not only pay due attention to putting out the current ‘fire’ of youth unemployment, but also to finding integrated solutions in education, social affairs and sectors of the economy.</p>

Similarly, the 23 million SMEs in Europe are vital for economic development in our regions and must be given special attention. However, letting us believe that the European Union has EUR 82 billion of unspent funds in its safes that the Commission can just use as it pleases could worry our citizens and lead them to believe that there is a lack of rigorous and planned management for structural funds. Also, the Commission must prove that it has learned its lesson to place greater emphasis on the importance of long-term programming for the ERDF and the ESF and the Member States and regions’ responsibility to manage them. It must then support the Member States using its expertise in the implementation of projects in order to simplify their allocation as much as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lv">The European Commission’s efforts to help the Member States overcome the crisis, particularly by combating youth unemployment and by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are most welcome. However, the Commission’s plan to divert EUR 82 billion of Structural Funds resources that had not previously been allocated, including EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund, should still be carefully analysed in tandem with the Member States involved. Thought should be given to where and how to invest those resources most effectively for the long-term development of the labour market, particularly in terms of creating jobs for young people. At the moment there is still a considerable lack of clarity. The Member States ought , in every respect, to take their responsibility for the quality of education and for breaking the vicious circle very seriously, so that young people, particularly those without any work experience, may successfully enter the labour market. This might be, for example, through undergoing work experience or receiving assistance to start up their own businesses. The programmes of this type that have been proposed are very important to States with a high unemployment rate, such as Latvia, where talented and educated young people who are unable to find attractive work are already going to look for jobs outside Latvia. This trend is very dangerous for the nation’s viability and economic growth in the long term.

At the first level, we must quickly find other funds for supporting employment and small and medium-sized enterprises. At the second level, we need stable and fair working conditions so that countries, such as the Slovak Republic, cannot arbitrarily amend their labour codes, in which they support up to 550 hours of overtime.

      <p sl="el">Cohesion policy is one of the main policies of the EU for addressing the economic crisis. It was the spearhead of the European Economic Recovery Plan adopted in 2008 and the recent increase in the percentage of cofinancing for projects implemented within the framework of cohesion policy is yet another example of the contribution made by the Structural Funds to recovery attempts. During the informal summit on 30 January 2012, the EU-27 leaders agreed that resources should be used to address youth unemployment and to increase funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, by using the EUR 82 billion yet to be allocated to the Member States by the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. However, it must be made clear that the EUR 82 billion in question has simply not yet been spent on specific projects; these are not unallocated resources. Finally, the following paradox needs to be emphasised: even though the Member States are supporting efforts to recover from the crisis via the Structural Funds, some of them are proposing cuts both in the future cohesion policy which they extol and in the annual Community budgets, which will create numerous problems with the most important development policy of the EU.</p>

At the beginning of 2009, the gas supply from Russia was interrupted for several weeks. Last year, it was doubtful whether Europe would receive Russian gas or not because of the Ukrainian-Russian disputes. The situation did not improve this year. In January the quantity of gas arriving from Russia decreased significantly from one day to the next in a Member State with a population of 9 million people. Fellow representatives, we are aware of the solution. It has repeatedly been noted in the House and elsewhere that we need new sources of gas. However, the construction of import pipelines seems to be taking too long. In the short term, therefore, we need to focus on the construction of pipelines connecting the Member States. The secure supply of gas to Central and Eastern Europe, which is most vulnerable, can only be ensured by connecting to the Member States of Western Europe, which already have alternative sources of supply. Such a solution is in the interests of the whole of the European Union.</p>

I believe that the European public has already lost confidence, to a large extent, in the agreement. In view of the doubts mentioned above, I have decided to vote against ratifying the ACTA in its present form. Let us also remember our call to the Commission on 24 November 2010 to confirm that implementing the ACTA will not have any influence on fundamental rights and data protection. So far, I have not heard any such confirmation. Finally, I cannot help but mention one political issue. It is a shame and a disgrace that there are some political parties and organisations which want to take advantage of the legitimate discontent of the Internet society in Europe, by pretending to be its protectors and forgetting that some of them have been involved in preparing and granting the European Commission’s mandate to sign this agreement. This is a very important and sensitive matter, and it is my opinion that it should not be used for short-term political gains.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, over the space of just two weeks, we have seen two Union airlines go bankrupt. The bankruptcy of Panair resulted in 22 000 passengers being stranded throughout the world and the bankruptcy of Malev stranded 7 200 passengers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Despite the European Parliament’s resolution calling on the Commission to prepare a legislative proposal to protect passengers in the event that their airline goes bankrupt, the Commission has, unfortunately, done nothing of substance to date. These new airline bankruptcies are painful reminders of a loophole in passenger protection.</p>
      <p sl="el">In its reply to a question submitted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism just last December, the Commission again appeared to be undecided as to whether or not a proper protection scheme should be enacted for all passengers or if a system should be applied on a voluntary basis. Rescue tickets offered to passengers by third-party companies may help, but we need a permanent legislative solution to this problem and we need it as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I wish to draw the attention of the European Parliament to the calls for help of many. Society’s most vulnerable groups are bearing the brunt of the consequences of the economic crisis. That is particularly true in Hungary today, where the flat-rate tax and family policy measures favouring the well-off have created a massive hole in the budget, which the government is preparing to plug by withdrawing the disability pensions that were agreed on earlier. The government will change insurance-type pensions granted, based on years in service, to people no longer capable of working to lower, benefits-type pensions, or will deprive them of income if they cannot find work on the labour market, which cannot even provide jobs for the healthy. Meanwhile the government is conveying the message that those in question are workshy fraudsters abusing the system. I have received numerous letters asking me to inform the European Parliament of the plight of these people. To quote from one letter: ‘I understand that we need to tighten our belts, but in this country that somehow seems only to apply to the poor these days’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I speak on behalf of the many individuals in this House on the continuing and increasingly grave threats to freedom of expression in Russia. We have recently seen the introduction of a new law which bans the so-called ‘promotion of homosexuality’. Its starting point is that homosexuality is wrong. However, I would maintain that what is wrong is the promotion of intolerance and discrimination – precisely what these repressive laws set out to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">These laws have already been adopted in the Russian states of Arkhangelsk, Ryazan and Kostroma. Now they are being introduced in St Petersburg and Moscow. The Federal Parliament is also considering doing exactly the same. Some say that people are not affected by this, but three activists have already been fined under these laws.</p>
      <p sl="en">But what does ‘promotion of homosexuality’ mean? It is wide enough to censor anyone who dares speak for those who have no voice, and that is why the EU should make the highest possible representation to Russia to speak out in defence of these fundamental human rights.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, in light of the dramatic events in Greece last night, I should like to point out that there are two ways of dealing with fiscal problems: one is the policy being applied now, which tries to depress the cost of labour and create conditions which reduce a European country to the level of a third-world country or China. On the other hand, I consider that focussing on cohesion, focussing on job creation in green sectors, focussing on change, education and reform, with the participation of civil society, so that it can address its fiscal problems by improving public services and reviving its economy, is a solution in keeping with European values.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is clear today that many of the arrangements in the new Memorandum are not in keeping with European values. How can we expect young people to stay in Greece when they are paid just EUR 440 a month for an eight-hour day, when the cost of living, because there are no suitable social infrastructures, is over EUR 800? Young people are already abandoning Greece, with over 600 people a day leaving for other European countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Troika and the Commission representative are focussing unilaterally on reducing labour costs; instead the Commission should be investing in innovation. We need to ‘win over’ society to participate in the reforms. It will be impossible to achieve fiscal targets or reforms in general with society opposed to the reforms. However, that means that society must have incentives, must know that there is cohesion, that there will be jobs, that soon there will be a better quality of life for everyone; otherwise, it will oppose the reforms. I worry that movements will arise against the European Union and that grassroots movements will gain ground in Greece, whereas the solution needs to be a European solution and the Commission and Parliament and the other Member States will need to make a serious contribution.</p>

For centuries, traditional methods that safeguard public health have been used to dry cod in Portugal.

Why in the world is the Commission messing around with and jeopardising these methods? I ask this because I also want to ask what hidden power the Scandinavian companies that employ this new method can have over the Commission, for this new technology to be imposed? I bring this up for a simple reason: it is sad that we are giving the public this impression of our priorities for EU action. At a time when we are seeing so many shortages of things essential to the lives of the European public, the Commission is choosing to prioritise meddling in the cod industry.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I welcome Governor Capriles’ election in yesterday’s primaries as the candidate for the united democratic opposition in Venezuela. I hope that a change of power will be possible, if the majority of Venezuelans in that much-loved country so wish it, with all the electoral guarantees enshrined in democracy. Good luck, Venezuela!</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I am going to speak on a subject on which my colleagues Mr Enciu and Mr Marinescu have also spoken earlier. President Martin Schulz also mentioned this during the opening of the part-session. Unfortunately, however, he said that he had not briefed himself on the matter and did not want us to adopt a definite stance on the statements and actions of Mr Wilders, the President of the Dutch Party for Freedom. As has already been mentioned, it concerns the idea of creating a website where citizens from Central and Eastern Europe are named and shamed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to point out that this is the same party which made support for the government in The Hague conditional upon refusing to accept Romania as part of Schengen. Even though all the other Member States think that both Romania and Bulgaria deserve to join Schengen, the Netherlands Government is blocking their entry, and I repeat, subject to blackmail by Wilders. On the other hand, it must be understood that this is going on at a time when the Netherlands is one of the countries which has introduced again restrictions preventing Romanian citizens from accessing the labour market. This combination of labour market restrictions, arbitrary approach to the Schengen area and stigmatising Romanian citizens is highly embarrassing for Europeans. I should mention that Romania has been in Europe for five years.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, there is a very good saying in English: ‘every family has a black sheep’. Today Latvia has an official political party, Visu Latvijai! , which believes that the war criminals of the Latvian SS Legion are heroes. These radicals impugn one third of the entire Latvian population, dubbing them occupiers and colonists. They insult monuments and dates that are sacrosanct to many residents of Latvia. They initiated the closure of minority schools. However, this did not prevent this association of admirers of the SS Legion from becoming part of the Latvian Government. As a result, the country finds itself on the verge of ethnic conflict. I believe that the European Parliament should urgently assess the activities of these nationalist radicals, and should also demand that the Latvian Government explain how it can include people who support war crimes and consider them to be heroic deeds. Thank you.</p>
