      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report (A7-0059/2012) by Frédérique Ries, on behalf of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes (COM(2011)0353 - C7-0169/2011 - 2011/0156(COD)).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would have also liked to welcome the Danish Presidency but perhaps this is the aftermath of defeat, I do not know, so we will do this without it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, and this is important, I would particularly like to thank Ms Lange, Ms Sârbu, Ms Girling, and Ms Liotard, as well as Mr Schlyter and Mr Rossi, who acted as rapporteurs for their respective political groups throughout the course of this lengthy piece of work and who have proven that we are clearly stronger together than when Parliament is divided on certain issues. This, of course, is in the best interests of the citizens, families and vulnerable population groups who are most likely to be affected by this future legislation on food.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text which we will now debate and which we will vote on in three hours’ time is essential for newborns, young children under the age of three and those suffering from long-term illnesses who have specific nutritional needs. To put it simply, here we are targeting food intended for particular groups, which covers close to 2% of the large food market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will not dwell too long on how this legislation came into being, suffice to say that the Commission has done well after 35 years of the legislation on dietary foods being in force, and after it was extended to other types of products, to undertake the complete renovation of this particular legal arsenal, and for good reason. We must establish order in this jungle of food products which is threatening the cohesion of the internal market and which, moreover, often does not allow consumers to exercise their freedom of choice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By voting unanimously on my draft report on 29 February – let me remind you – the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection sent a clear message, which I will summarise as follows: the Commission’s approach, which I just mentioned, of simplifying this legislation and abolishing the concept of dietary foods is the right approach. We have supported it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also crucial to maintain a tailor-made legislative framework for three types of foodstuff: food intended for infants and young children – both liquid and solid food – and food intended for sick people, as I said. In other words, sub-categories of restricted groups, to put it that way, who therefore cannot exercise this freedom of choice, hence the vital importance for us to maintain strict rules on labelling and composition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, we wanted to broaden the scope to other equally vulnerable population groups, without wanting to make the situation worse, of course. Specifically, I am talking about people who are overweight and on drastic diets of less than 1 200 calories per day and people intolerant to gluten, in other words those suffering from what is known as coeliac disease. Around 2% of the European population suffer from this disease and they strongly support our desire to maintain a specific legal framework for these so-called gluten-free products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would remind you that this legislation aims to protect the most fragile, the most vulnerable among us, and that is essential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also wanted – I will not be able to mention everything but this is important – to think about our most dynamic European companies, these small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are at the heart of innovation and job creation in Europe. Whether they are Italian or German companies involved in gluten-free products, Belgium companies – off the top of my head – involved in food supplements, the least we can say is that SMEs, many of which approached us throughout the course of our work, were worried to see the Commission’s plan to shake up the current legislation in the 2006 regulation on claims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can easily understand their concerns and I will use a single argument, but an important one: the costs they must bear in order to draw up a robust scientific file to present to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), on average between EUR 500 000 and EUR 1 000 000. How do you expect healthy and fair competition to be established under these conditions? That is why access to the internal market for SMEs must be a common theme across all of our legislation. Of course, that is what we are saying here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To finish, I would like to send a brief message to the shadow rapporteurs. You will understand that, in my capacity as rapporteur, I must stand by the overall compromise that was reached in committee. I do not wish to re-open new issues or issues that were resolved in committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even though, personally, I can sympathise with some of the amendments tabled in plenary, particularly Amendment 84 on pesticides, I will stand by our agreement, our compromises. It is covered in our own amendment, Amendment 63, and furthermore a promise is a promise and I will stand by it. Thank you, and I am looking forward to hearing the next speakers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in line with the principle of better regulation, the Commission proposal concerning foods for infants and young children, and foods for special medical purposes seeks to simplify current legislation by removing rules that have become unnecessary or sometimes contradictory.</p>
      <p sl="en">The protection of vulnerable groups of the population is one of the key objectives of the proposal we are discussing here today. But before turning to the substance of the proposal I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Ries, for preparing the report, and also the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should also mention the input from other committees – the Committees on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE). The Commission is pleased with the general line taken, as regards the proposed amendments. The proposal would abolish the concept of dietetic food – a concept that is today considered outdated given the evolution of the food market over the past decade.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to see that honourable Members openly agree with this approach and recognise the need to fundamentally revise the existing legislation. The scope of the proposed draft regulation would be limited to a number of well-known categories of foods intended for vulnerable groups of the population, namely infants and young children, and people that need products for the dietary management of conditions under medical supervision.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of the proposed amendments suggest adding slimming foods intended to replace the total daily diet to the scope of the regulation. Although I believe that these foods could be managed comprehensively under the horizontal rules of food law, I understand Parliament’s concerns and I am open to considering their inclusion within the scope of the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, my support cannot extend to the inclusion of gluten-free foods within the scope of the regulation. This, in our view, is unnecessary and would be in line neither with the interest of coeliacs, for whom these products are intended, nor with the principles of better regulation and simplification.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all agree on the importance of maintaining the existing rules on such foods. But this can be ensured in a simpler and better way by transferring these rules to the recently adopted Regulation on Food Information to Consumers. In addition, such a transfer would guarantee that the existing rules would also apply to non-prepacked foods and would consequently offer higher and broader protection to coeliacs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several amendments have been made as regards labelling provisions and restricted use of pesticides in baby foods. I can tell you that I share the same views as Parliament as regards protecting infants and young children, and I can agree in principle with the suggestions made. However, I believe that the details to give effect to these principles should be dealt with in the specific delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also support the same positive approach concerning the preparation of reports on sports foods and growing-up milks. On the other hand, I cannot support the amendments regarding the establishment and update of the Union list of substances by delegated acts instead of implementing acts. The Commission’s proposal is in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon and the Commission Guidelines on delegated acts. This approach should not be changed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding advertising, enabling Member States to apply further restrictions to all foods for infants and young children, without distinction, would be disproportionate to the objectives of the draft regulation and can have an impact on the good functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you can see, there is much more that unites us than divides us and I remain confident that discussions both in Parliament and Council will lead to a good final text at second reading. I look forward to having your views.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, right at the start I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Ries, for her excellent work. We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – and it was I who drafted its opinion here – readily agreed with its sound views and sound basis, and it is our opinion, and mine, that this is a very important piece of legislation, given that the previous legislation in many respects became obsolete.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important that we are careful in this area, especially because, when we talk about infant formulae and food for medical purposes, then obviously their packaging has to be very clearly labelled. Their presentation must also be clear and the wording must be comprehensible. It is also important that it does not contain any misleading claim, medical or otherwise, and that people actually know what they are getting as consumers.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I might say that, as I myself have become a grandfather and have therefore become familiar with these infant formulae in a very practical sense, it is obvious that clarity is required in this area, and that we have to step in when such misleading advertising exists: advertising must be clear and the information must be correct and reliable in all respects.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are a number of benefits that this legislation will offer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, it will protect consumers more efficiently by better informing them on specific food products. Labelling should be clear, easy to understand and should not make medical claims – in this regard, for example, the notion of dietetic foods is no longer appropriate as there have not been explicit criteria up until now to define particular food as dietetic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, it is absolutely imperative to provide a high level of consumer protection for vulnerable groups. For instance, we have to ensure that milks intended for infants and young children are strictly regulated with regard to their content. Thorough research is needed to find out to what extent these milks really contribute to the growth and health of children. Moreover, the proposed simplification of the existing legal framework will contribute to the better functioning of the internal market. It will reduce the administrative burden on companies, increase transparency and further stimulate free movement of goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that we will all support the balanced proposal, which will provide optimal protection for consumers’ health. My congratulations to the rapporteur and all colleagues in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) with whom we had very good cooperation on this dossier.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to support the line taken by the rapporteur and also offer our sincere thanks for her work. We agree with the Commission that we urgently need to tidy up this legislation, in the face of the uncontrolled growth in diabetic foods and specialist food products now on the internal market. Our position is that ordinary food legislation has now developed to such an extent that most products can just be covered by it. We do, however, want to protect the most vulnerable groups in our society.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are thus discussing a separate regime for food for medical purposes and for food intended for infants and young children, but we are specifically adding, in this regard, dietetic foods and also gluten, as it is not fully clear to us precisely how and when the Commission will be regulating these foodstuffs under the general legislation on foodstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I want to call on the Commission, and above all the Council, too, to act quickly. We have now done our homework; we have a report that has been adopted with a large majority, and I expect that the same will shortly be true of the plenary. It is thus now up to the Council to bring about a balanced negotiating mandate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">While we sit here talking, all kinds of new food products come on the market, such as growing milk for one to three-year-olds. Parents in Europe are confused about this product. Is this really an indispensible product in the diet of a young child that we therefore need to regulate through special legislation? Or is it actually just long-life milk with some added vitamins? Or – worse still – is it perhaps bad for children owing to the fact that it has a very sweet vanilla taste, giving children a tendency towards sweet things for the rest of their lives?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, Europe sometimes seems so far removed from the citizens. I call on you to shed light on this issue via the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Every parent in Europe will be grateful.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur because she took into consideration our colleagues’ recommendations while both drafting the report and tabling the amendments. I feel that the aim of these regulations is to guarantee that people have access to relevant, correct information about the food they eat.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Great strides have been made in recent years in European Union legislation on food labelling, which has resulted in greater transparency and protection for consumers. However, the old legislation on dietetic foods poses an obstacle preventing further progress on this. This is why I welcomed the proposal tabled by the Commission, as well as the improvements put forward in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One of my main concerns about this dossier has been the issue of labelling and advertising powder milk formulae for infants and young children. As we are aware, in many cases, even in spite of the advice given or regulations, breast-milk substitutes are promoted aggressively. At the moment, the statistics confirm that the proportion of mothers breastfeeding remains low across the whole European Union. Legislative loopholes are exploited which either allow the advertising rules to be circumvented or make it difficult to enforce them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I voted against including so-called ‘growing milk’ in these regulations, a product intended for young children. I had a justified reason for this: there is no evidence confirming that this product provides nutritional benefits, compared to a normal, balanced diet. This product is not a food for special medical purposes. It is no more than an expensive substitute for ordinary milk and a balanced diet. However, because it is available in stores, the advertising claims made by producers about the product’s quality must be thoroughly justified.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The purpose of these regulations is clear: so that we can help ensure that people are properly informed when they choose what they eat, and opt for a healthy, balanced diet.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – I would like to ask Ms Sârbu the following question: this legislation is again associated with a lot of red tape, for example in relation to pesticides.

      <p sl="ro">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, the reason is precisely that there may be certain loopholes in the legislation we have had until now, which are being abused, resulting in this situation that we have currently ended up in. Tighter legislation is needed, which will be observed and adopted in such a way to make everything crystal clear and ensure that we ultimately arrive at the solutions which we want.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me start by congratulating my colleague Frédérique Ries on her report and for the great work accomplished in bringing forward the solid compromises on the Commission proposal aimed at ensuring a high level of consumer protection in relation to foods for infants and young children, and foods for special medical purposes. I believe that Parliament’s position today makes a significant contribution to, and strengthens, this initial objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">I especially welcome the fact that substitute meals replacing all or part of a person’s daily food intake continue to be the subject of specific legislation, thus ensuring stricter control over the composition of such food and safeguarding the consumer interest when it comes to health and nutrition claims.</p>
      <p sl="de">Growing-up milk and milk intended for young children was a key point of our discussion in committee, and still is today, ahead of the vote in plenary. It will probably not be possible to address all the issues at stake through this piece of legislation alone, and I therefore very much welcome the inclusion of a request to the Commission to further assess the status of these products and to evaluate the need for specific legislation, notably for milks intended for children aged between 12 and 36 months. It is in the interests of all consumers, in the interests of children and their mothers, to ensure strict and safe composition rules, but also to guarantee the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, when it comes to communication on these products, the health of infants and children comes first and should take precedence over the interests of production and marketing.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, on the contrary, we cooperated quite well. I really should speak Swedish, of course.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The starting point for my work on this matter was the protection of children and the protection of vulnerable consumers. We have succeeded to a certain extent in making the rules simpler. What I am most satisfied with are the restrictions on the advertising of infant formulae. I would also like you to support our amendment containing even stricter rules for the use of pesticides. The most dangerous pesticides that we manufacture must under no circumstances be used in the production of agricultural products for the manufacture of baby food. It is nonsensical, and I hope we will receive support for it, but even the original proposal tightens up the rules slightly.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also think it is good that we are doing away with unnecessary special categories of food, and I hope the Commission, the Council and Parliament will find a good solution so that we do not only help those who are gluten intolerant, but also those who are intolerant to soya and milk proteins. Then we can have comprehensive legislation that is able to protect all consumers. I would like to thank everyone involved for their excellent cooperation during the work on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I also offer my congratulations to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs. Better regulation should simplify the rules, unravel the tangle and make interpretation and implementation simpler, and this is a thread which clearly runs through the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I absolutely agree that infants, young children and people with particular medical conditions should be protected from misleading information, but I do ask myself sometimes whether we have really simplified this proposal, or whether we are just making it more complicated, but in slightly different areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, it is true, as the rapporteur said, that we had an agreement, but that agreement was breached by putting amendments to this plenary session, so I feel quite free on my own account to breach it too. So I will talk about the issues that I did not sign up to in the compromise. The first was the proposal on gluten-free. I certainly do not believe that the proposal that we have come up with in committee makes it easier for consumers. I do not believe it adds anything at all to their safety or to the protection of their vulnerability. It is protecting certain manufacturers in certain countries, and certain national regimes, and we should cut across that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also have particular problems with the low calorie diet and very low calorie diet proposals from committee. They were offered no evidence at all that medicalising people who have a condition known to threaten their health would be helped by making it more difficult for them to get hold of the products that they find useful.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again, following on with the ‘no evidence’, we were offered no evidence at all on the advertising of the milk products, the follow-on milk. It was an emotional reaction, which I am sure is very worthy, but there was no evidence. We should be making our rules based on the evidence in front of us. Again, on these new amendments on pesticides, we already have, in my view, strict and well-regulated rules in place for the use of pesticides. No evidence was produced, beyond opinion, that it was necessary to provide stricter controls for these vulnerable groups. If we are going to make these points and legislate on them, people should at least have the courtesy of showing us decent evidence as to why we should go along that road.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – I have a question for Ms Girling. She has just stated that the rules for gluten intolerance will not be of any further help. I believe that it is very important to protect these people because intolerance sufferers require this strict diet. If we fail to include them in the high protection standards of this regulation, instead depending solely on food labelling, then the necessary level of protection is not assured. It is for this reason that I strongly support this resolution and would like to ask Ms Girling why she believes this is not the case.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, the simple answer is that I think the speaker is wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a question of whether or not these groups are helped. I do not believe that they are helped by this extra proposal. I do not think it helps at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the proposal and the regulation we are putting in place on food – across food information for consumers, health claims – is all adequate. Adding to this proposal does not help consumers at all. In fact, it may confuse them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on drafting the report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As far as the new regulation is concerned, it should be noted that the previous provisions left much to be desired in practice. Despite the fact that they were adopted in order to enable the free movement of this type of goods, they have led to disruptions in trade on the EU’s internal market owing to the ambiguous and often unclear regulations. We should therefore now support the amendments which aim to eliminate excessive administrative burdens and prevent restrictions on competitiveness, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises which dominate this specialised sector of the food industry.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Market issues aside, however, food safety is of paramount importance. It is especially significant when it concerns population groups as sensitive as children. I would also like to voice my agreement with the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, which has stated that the Member States should be allowed to apply national regulations wherever justified in the interest of public health protection. Such a solution would not jeopardise the concept of identical treatment of similar products across the entire European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, when we go into a supermarket these days and look at, say, the yoghurt section, we could be forgiven for thinking that we have just stepped into a pharmacy, such is the range on offer. However, this level of advertising, which is ultimately excessive, contrasts with the lack of information and labelling for sectors of the population with specific needs: newborns, infants, those who are gluten- or lactose-intolerant, diabetics, and many others. More serious still, these foods are often unavailable, even after looking in several supermarkets and shops. Lack of availability cannot be an option for those with no choice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another pertinent issue is price, as these products are generally much more expensive. For people with special nutritional needs this is not a matter of choice, but of absolute necessity. We cannot allow a situation in which, in this area too, there is a gulf between those who can obtain items that are essential in their life and those who cannot. This is a key concern for us, as a public health issue, and the health of all of us cannot rest in the hands of the few yet powerful food industry multinationals.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Clear rules are needed to protect those who have no choice, and it is clear to us that Europe cannot ignore the health of the most vulnerable.</p>

      <p sl="de">We have succeeded in achieving a good consensus on most issues in the committee. I also wish expressly to welcome the compromise on special foods for coeliacs. We have had lengthy discussions within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and believe that it is important to continue to provide special foods in this context, because the point is not just that these foods are gluten-free – after all this can be assured by means of labelling regulations – but that a balanced diet is essential. After all, if I just eat sweets for the whole day, I may have avoided gluten, but I certainly will not have eaten healthily. That is why the question of balance must be considered.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are particularly concerned about infants and young children. The various amendments currently tabled should not create the impression that we somehow differ on the question of pesticides in baby food. I was involved when the European Parliament pushed through harmonisation at the most stringent level possible in the 1990s. We made it practically mandatory that only organic ingredients should be permitted in baby food, because the detection limit defines what we allow. If the detection limit is to be lowered, then the Commission will have to come up with a new proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">I myself have worked in a paediatric clinic and I believe it is always important to listen to what specialist doctors and professional medical groups have to say on these issues. At the time, these people advised us to put very strict regulations in place. We followed this advice. They are now telling us, however, that what Ms Ries and others in the Committee have proposed, which is what we have agreed, is also the pragmatic solution and that we do not need to go beyond this. I would ask the Commission to monitor this. When we have new detection methods, then we can do more. Otherwise, this is a balanced proposal and we should not give the impression that we are somehow offering some children better protection than others.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur. This report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with an absolute majority of 62 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions. This shows that we are actually very much at one with regard to the compromises.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we must give the greatest priority in this legislative process to the provision of high level consumer protection for the younger members of society, in other words children, who need special consideration. Gluten intolerance is a problem, particularly in nurseries. If we look around us – I myself have two children in this age group – we will be aware of the allergies and intolerances that arise, which is why I believe that we have chosen the right approach. We should continue to discuss this in the second reading, also involving the Council and Commission. I believe that we will then also achieve positive results.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission’s decision to do away with the notion of dietetic foods, so that they fall into other regulatory frameworks, is detrimental to the particular groups of people for whom these foods were intended – for example, children up to the age of three, infants, coeliacs, professional athletes and those who need very low-calorie products.</p>
      <p sl="it">This choice was opposed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and agreement was not reached at first reading. The report that was adopted attempts to fill in many gaps. For example, it calls for foods for premature underweight babies and coeliacs and foods with low calorie content to be brought back into the scope of the regulation, for appropriate standards to be adopted for milk for children between the ages of one and three, for the innovation clause to be retained, and for foods for professional sportspersons to be regulated again. Particular attention should be given to coeliacs. Therefore, a specific regulation must be maintained which has fully demonstrated its efficiency. Simply mentioning allergens on the label does not guarantee the level of safety necessary.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, wanting to simplify European legislation is a very good thing. To put it simply, this must not be achieved to the detriment of food safety. This must not allow us to compromise on the demand for double safety, namely, nutrition safety and health safety, all the more so when we are talking about vulnerable population groups.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are talking about infants. We are talking about people who need energy-restricted diets, such as diabetics. We are talking about people intolerant to gluten.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is completely incomprehensible not to want to include within this framework people who are truly intolerant to gluten or those on energy-restricted diets. It is incomprehensible when we know that today one in every hundred people develops a gluten allergy. That is why we very much want to reintegrate gluten-free food into the legislation so that there is better consumer protection. Otherwise, repealing strict provisions would be truly harmful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also expecting the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to make a statement on ‘growing foods’, such as ‘growing milk’ for children aged one to three, because we do not see why these children should not benefit from milk that is adapted to their needs, without pesticides or contaminants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would of course like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ms Ries, and I am sure that Parliament will succeed in defending the most vulnerable consumers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report has been a huge task and I welcome many of the changes made by the Commission and the rapporteur. However, I want to focus on one particular issue, which is the advertising of so-called follow-on formula milk for infants over six months old. The World Health Organisation and most paediatricians agree that these formulas are not necessary. Currently there is a ban on advertising formula milk for newborns, but follow-on formula can be, and is, widely advertised. Last year I tried to stop a misleading health claim on follow-on milk with the support of the majority of MEPs, but sadly we did not get the absolute majority we needed to block the claim.</p>
      <p sl="en">Research shows that due to marketing techniques many parents do not know the difference between infant formula and follow-on formula and that they start using follow-on formula far too early. I fear that allowing advertising of follow-on formulas creates a loophole in the ban on advertising infant formula and it is a loophole that we should definitely close.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously, parents are naturally anxious to provide the best nutrition possible for their children, but they should make these decisions on the basis of objective information from experts and not be pressurised by industry into buying products that may not be necessary. I therefore urge all Members to vote in favour of Amendment 86.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I do not know how long ago it is that Ms Willmott used formula milk, but on formula there is a gigantic ‘1’, which means zero to six months. On follow-on formula there is gigantic number ‘2’, which means the second age group, six to twelve months. How stupid does Ms Willmott think European citizens are? Is this not an example of the European nanny state trying to regulate everything and focusing on the wrong things? So please vote against Amendment 68, which is absolutely superfluous.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, the Member is right, it is an awful long time since I had a child, since I am a lot older than she is. I have to say that I never actually used formula milk. I only breast fed, but that is irrelevant. This is not actually about whether a woman chooses to breast feed or bottle feed. I have no problem with whatever a woman chooses to do – that is entirely up to her, as people have different life experiences and different life styles. They may have various problems with breast feeding. However, many parents – and research has proven this – do not understand the difference between infant formula and follow-on formula. The Member should look at the research if she does not believe me. Surely what we should not be doing is misleading parents into buying things that they should not necessarily be giving to their children.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the protection of vulnerable population groups is an important task of society, and therefore the current rules regulating the production and sale of foodstuffs intended for infants and young children and of foodstuffs for special purposes that are no longer in line with the latest scientific knowledge need to be brought up to date. I would like to begin by applauding the efforts of the Commission to simplify and clarify these rules. Better knowledge of the action of various substances on the human body has allowed us to formulate the necessary limits more precisely and to lay down stricter rules, a result of which is the introduction of a ban on the presence of pesticides in foodstuffs intended for special purposes. Despite the Commission’s efforts to create a comprehensive law to regulate the production and sale of foodstuffs intended for infants and young children and of foodstuffs for special purposes, there remains the open question of incorporating foodstuffs for people intolerant to gluten, and milk drinks intended for young children, into the text of the proposed regulation. We must therefore continue to monitor very closely the development of knowledge in the area of the action of individual substances on the human body and be prepared to amend the current rules as and when necessary.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would also like to thank Ms de Lange for the work she has done on behalf of our group. While recognising the importance of the debate in relation to baby foods, we should not forget that there are also other population groups that are seriously affected. When we consider the statistics, we can see that between 10 and 30 % of the European population suffers from lactose intolerance, 5 to 7 % from fructose malabsorption, 1 % from histamine intolerance and 1 % from coeliac disease. Doctors believe that the number of unreported cases is much higher.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current legal framework we have here in Europe is difficult to interpret, firstly for the control bodies and secondly for the companies that produce these foods. It is even more difficult – particularly for consumers – to find the right product. The variety of products has increased dramatically in recent years and decades: just think, for example, of the various protein bars that are now available to aid muscle development in athletes. Other examples include food supplements for expectant mothers, foods enriched with calcium and vitamin C for older people, and, in particular, the wide variety of diet products on offer that promise weight loss within a few weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">The legal framework currently available to us encompasses four different directives and regulations, such as the directive on foods for special diets, for starter and follow-on foods for babies, low calorie foods, and so on. For this reason we need to think about how we can take a unified approach. This proposal should provide such a unified approach, because it shows that labelling must be transparent for consumers, that businesses must be clear about what their labels should say and, above all, that the authorities can verify compliance. This means we can achieve a win-win situation and create an internal market in this area, which we have unfortunately so far failed to achieve on account of the differing national interpretations.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I share the view of many of my fellow Members that this is an important piece of legislation for protecting particularly vulnerable consumers on the market. I therefore also think it is good that we are including gluten in this legislation. It will also make it easier for those who are gluten intolerant to travel in Europe and find the food they need.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also like to say that I would have gladly voted in favour of Mr Schlyter’s Amendment 84, but I will not be doing so as a result of the compromise that we have arrived at with the other groups, which also involves a stricter regulation of pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will also be voting in favour of Amendment 86. Since Ms de Lange thinks that someone needs to have had young children recently in order to be able to vote on this, I can say that I have two children, and I both breast fed them and gave them both infant formula 1 and infant formula 2. I know how similar the packaging looks. Why is it, then, that they are almost identical, in that the numbers look almost the same and they have the same colours? Well, it is because the company wants to get round this prohibition of advertising milk for infants by advertising its follow-on product, namely product number 2. It is simply a way for the market to avoid the prohibition we have in place, and this shows that we must extend this prohibition. I have even bought the wrong product by mistake myself, so similar are the products at present.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, we expect the highest standards from our foodstuffs. This is particularly the case in relation to the food we feed our babies and infants. Here we are concerned not just with the preservation of life and health, but also with growth and development. We should err on the side of caution here and avoid all apparent risks. Manufacturers have to stake their reputation on their products and every mistake is punished by the consumer through the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must be possible to measure every limit value. We have already put in place a strict European regulation in the area of plant protection, which came into force last summer. European regulations in relation to residues from plant protection products are based on detection limits and are several times lower than the levels that can actually cause harm. There is no test method in the world that can establish what products were used to treat a plant during its growth cycle if there is no residue in the crops themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament has established the precautionary principle and has set down special protections for the sensitive groups, in particular infants and small children. This is something upon which we can build. We struggled in committee to come up with the right wording. I hope that we will also live up to our responsibilities in the plenary sitting.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like particularly to thank the rapporteur, Ms Ries, and our shadow rapporteur, Ms de Lange, for their excellent work. We also need to accept that children over the age of one can enjoy a healthy and sufficient diet by sharing in the food at the family table. That is something we should also once again acknowledge as important.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs on the compromises reached in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as they strengthen the Committee’s proposal by ensuring greater protection for vulnerable groups of consumers and an increase in the information provided.</p>
      <p sl="it">The exclusion of gluten-free products in the initial proposal is a prime example. It would have penalised a continually growing group of people affected by an illness caused by intolerance to an allergen, which does not allow them a complete and balanced diet able to provide an adequate nutritional profile to ensure physical well-being.</p>
      <p sl="it">In future negotiations with the Council a cross-cutting regulation may be proposed in conjunction with regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. In this case the generic term ‘gluten-free’ must appear with the term ‘suitable for coeliacs’ to make a clear distinction between products free from allergens and those for proper nutrition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, this regulation achieves a great deal of what we are looking for, namely greater security for producers, safety for consumers and a range of control options. The Food Labelling Regulation is a first step in improving freedom of choice in the food market. Yet, there is a whole group of consumers who, because of their medical needs, do not have the same freedom of choice in the market. We need crystal-clear rules for these people, whether cancer patients or those suffering from metabolic disorders, offering them absolute certainty.</p>
      <p sl="de">As we have already heard several times today, however, we also need safety for the youngest members of our society, namely infants. The excessive pressure on parents from advertising can sometimes mean that they make decisions that may not be in the best interests of their babies. People should be free to choose between breastfeeding and formula. This decision must be based on facts, however, and should not be made solely on the basis of advertising pressure. I can only concur with Ms Willmott in relation to follow-on milk products.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcomed Ms Ries’ report, and therefore the proposal for a regulation aimed at amending and supplementing the rules on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes, as this text should allow Europe to establish a clearer and more coherent legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I would like to highlight the obligation to provide full, objective information on food products. One very sensitive case is the question of advertising for formulae for infants aged 0 to six months and formulae for infants aged six months to two years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The facts show that advertising practices tend to concern parents by using marketing strategies rather than providing them with information of a scientific and factual nature, allowing consumers to make a clear distinction in order to avoid any risk of confusion. This lack of clarity represents a danger to the health of our children, a danger which must be avoided by using stricter controls.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I think that the report could have provided for more effective evaluation mechanisms. This evaluation should not be carried out a priori , only taking into consideration the consumers the products are aimed at, but on the basis of a careful and comprehensive evaluation of all the ingredients in the product in question.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for these outstanding proposals. It was high time that we had an improvement. As has already been said here, innovations in the food field sometimes outpace the legislation. It is thus a good thing that we regularly pay attention to such matters, and certainly so given the fact that there are more and more people with all kinds of allergies and special needs. There is a real need for us to have a finger on the pulse here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, vulnerable groups and, as I mentioned earlier, allergy sufferers also need special consideration. It is not the case that it is always that easy to read. We have just been discussing follow-on milk; the packaging is almost identical, and even if there is a large 1, 2 or 3 on the packaging, parents buy items like this quickly, and I, too, have found myself confused on various occasions about what I need to grab, whether in relation to follow-on milk or other products.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That needs to improve and it needs to be clearer – information, I mean, including on the packaging. It may be that we need to move to a different kind of packaging, so that it is clear to parents and to people with special needs what exactly they are buying. Advertisements also have a very important role to play here, too, of course. I believe, however, that we really must tackle this this time, as misleading claims are still too often made in advertisements. In the Netherlands we even have a special prize for this, known as the Golden Wind Egg. Perhaps we could also introduce a European Golden Wind Egg for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will just very quickly make one more point. I would like to draw your attention to nanotechnology, which is also increasingly cropping up in specialist food products, but also in other food products. Developments here are moving very quickly, and I believe that it is now very much time that we pay attention to this in the very near future, including in respect of vulnerable groups.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the average consumer has complete freedom to choose products in the supermarket and to consume them afterwards. The provisions of the Food Labelling Regulation are sufficient for this. Certain groups, such as infants and small children, require particular protection when it comes to composition and labelling, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a mother of a one-year-old daughter who breast-fed her child for seven months, I am very pleased that milk replacement products can no longer be advertised with euphemistic images suggesting that these products might even be better than breast milk. I also welcome the fact that follow-on milk is once again to be examined, as I also decided against using this milk. It tastes sweet and actually encourages the child to prefer such products, so that in the future it will not drink conventional milk.</p>
      <p sl="de">People who suffer from gluten intolerance need special foods if they are to avoid serious complications, such as bowel cancer. It is for this reason that I also believe it important to maintain a high standard of protection here. This is only possible by incorporating gluten intolerance in the regulation. This includes, for example, provisions requiring that the foods for these patients should provide the same amount of vitamins and minerals as the foods they replace. It is vital that this protection standard is maintained.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Ries for her outstanding work. It is highly positive that there is now, in sometimes confusing situations, to be an improvement in order to protect – or better protect – vulnerable groups. It is also positive that more attention is being given to small and medium-sized enterprises in the food industry. I would also like to point out, however, that information on the labels alone is not a catch-all cure. In the past, people were a lot more involved with food, and in those days children were also much more informed about what was good for them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would actually like to ask the Commission to focus more on food education in schools and also on providing children with food education in other ways. Nowadays, children often no longer know how food originates, what is good for them and what is healthy. I believe that we must get the industry involved on a voluntary basis so that it not only makes commercials to extol its products, but it also plays a part in educating children in order to make it clear what is healthy for them, as that is better for everyone in the long term. I know that the Commission is passionate about this and I hope that initiatives will be forthcoming very quickly that will ultimately result in a healthier society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, because, as we know, the digestive tract of newborns is only capable of killing off germs ingested in food after two or three months, requirements in relation to the hygiene and quality of baby food must be particularly stringent. It is a particular feature of our hi-tech, science-dominated times, however, that parents often find themselves confused. As a father of five children, I know this from personal experience. Different sides express different opinions about breastfeeding, which is without doubt the perfect way to feed babies, and whether, when and how infants should be given starter foods, follow-on foods and solids.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is little we can do about this uncertainty, as parents need to decide for themselves what suits their needs and what they believe is right. It is doubtless important that the EU should ban all advertising that aims to discourage mothers from breastfeeding. That should not be allowed.</p>

I would wish to avoid the name ‘health for growth’ but would prefer to refer to it as ‘health for all’, focusing on health literacy. After all, labels, ingredients lists and other information are of little use if the population, in other words the consumer, does not really know about the health implications of the various foodstuffs on offer and is unaware of their own personal dietary needs.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I was, in fact, speaking in somewhat simplified terms earlier with regard to this matter of growing milk, follow-on formulae, formulae and so on, as there is a third category, and therefore we need a broad advertising ban. Otherwise, this third category, which also has very similar packaging, could also mislead consumers. Moreover, it should not be called ‘growing milk’ or anything like that. It should be called ‘dried cows’ milk with additives’; that is what it is, and so that is what we should call it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also not good for us to have a special category for sports food or meal replacements. Both of these ought to be covered by the usual health claims legislation and, therefore, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have proposed that we should remove these categories along with the study on sports milk, and instead include them in the normal health claims legislation.

      <p sl="en">With respect to the issue of specific rules for growing-up milks, I have to acknowledge that different views exist on whether or not these products are needed to satisfy the nutritional requirements of young children. I thus see a need to consult EFSA to clarify the nutritional needs of young children. I can thus support the preparation of a report on this issue. I am also willing to look into the issues of advertising as raised by Mrs Willmott and others.</p>
      <p sl="en">On pesticides, the relevant legislation has recently been reviewed and already takes into account vulnerable groups, including children. I agree totally that the use of pesticides in products intended for infants and young children should be restricted as far as possible. Indeed, the existing specific legislation on products intended for infants and young children already sets extremely low levels for pesticides – so low that they are de facto prohibitive. On this point, we can accept such amendments to the basic act as are consistent with existing rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to make one point: we have to make a difference between the application and the presence of pesticides. If we restrict ourselves to prohibiting application of pesticides, we will be trying to avoid the presence of pesticides on green fields from now on without really covering the contaminated fields which already exist and on which food intended for infants can be cultivated. Therefore, our concentration should be on the presence of pesticides in food, rather than the application of pesticides, because this will also cover any food grown on fields which has been contaminated in the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of gluten-free foods, I believe that we have to remove the perception that our proposal in any way reduces protection for coeliacs. On the contrary, we are increasing protection for coeliacs by maintaining the compositional and labelling rules as they are and transferring those rules to a more appropriate legal text on food information for consumers, which will protect coeliacs in relation to both non-packed and packed foods.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, this constitutes better regulation and simplification, as a transfer to the Food Information for Consumers (FIC) Regulation would ensure that all information related to gluten is covered by the same piece of legislation, since the FIC Regulation already covers the labelling of the presence of gluten in the list of ingredients.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I believe that broadening the scope of the food on which the gluten element is to be indicated will be more beneficial to coeliacs than if restricted to packed foods.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have some concluding remarks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank all of the speakers who took the floor and from whom I gather there is general support for the overall compromises we reached in committee. There were, of course – and I heard them, along with the Commission – colours, tones, priorities which we are aware of and which vary depending on the groups or individuals in question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some important issues were mentioned here: gluten-free food – the Commissioner has just returned to this point so I will return to it as well – labelling and advertising, questions on the added value of follow-on milk, the famous GUMS (growing-up milks), which Ms de Lange and Mr Schlyter mentioned. We have heard their concerns; I share them myself. We will come back to them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, the question of pesticides came up repeatedly, particularly in Ms Klaß’s speech: this is – as the Commissioner has just said – the linchpin of the overall, horizontal legislation which we all worked on together several months ago, and we have focused here on the even more ambitious, more precise and more specific needs of the groups concerned. However, we did it together precisely so that the texts would be coherent with the horizontal legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to talk about something which was not mentioned, perhaps because the Danish Presidency is not here, and that is the lack of agreement at first reading. The failure of this attempt is also to some extent the fault of the Presidency, but it is also perhaps because we are discovering the limitations of this fast track procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a method that we have used far too much since the beginning of this mandate, since 2009, and one in which Parliament and Parliament’s ambitions are not always taken into account, in my view. I therefore still believe that our decision to go to the vote and, indeed, to make a fresh start for a second reading – which I hope will be quick – is still the right decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will finish with the two major disagreements with the Commission, which I noted when listening to the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is the question of gluten-free products. There are many of us here – the majority in fact – who think that returning to the ‘food information to consumers’ legislation will not be enough. That goes beyond the question of labelling. For us, Article 36 of the Regulation on the provision of food information to consumers is not enough in terms of quality, safety and composition. However, we will come back to that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the question of delegated acts – you mentioned that at the very beginning, Commissioner – we, as Parliament, still want to be involved in any decision, through our right to scrutiny, for example, on amendments to the famous Union list. We are therefore holding firm on the question of delegated acts, but these are issues that are open.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that we will return to this very quickly with our Cypriot friends.</p>

      <p sl="ro">After well over 30 years, the regulations on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses, as stipulated in Framework Directive 2009/39/EC, no longer respond to the needs of consumers and the latest developments on the market. We need a legislative framework which will provide citizens with a high level of food safety, especially in the case of products intended for vulnerable sections of the population such as infants, young children and people with particular conditions. European citizens must be properly informed when they choose what they eat, and when they opt for a healthy, balanced diet, they must not be misled.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union has always had a legislative framework model for foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses which has been held in very high regard. However, it has been noticed recently that the development of both the food market and food legislation requires a major overhaul. I think that applying, on a general basis, the concept of ‘foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses’, which this framework directive is based on, while the market environment is changing, has given rise to significant problems not only for stakeholders, but also for the controlling authorities. Food safety, especially in the case of foods intended for vulnerable sections of the population, such as infants, young children and people with particular conditions, is an essential prerequisite for their movement and for the proper functioning of the internal market within the European Union. Therefore, I believe that a European solidarity policy is required comprising legislative measures to remove these discrepancies between national laws on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses, thereby allowing their free movement and creating a level competitive playing field.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes is aimed a revising and clarifying the rules for these foods in the European market. At present, on the basis of the current regulations, it is usually impossible to tell the difference in shops between food for normal consumption and food for young children, food for diabetics or other diets, or for top sports players. Milk products marked ‘for children’ often have much more sugar than other similar products, and sweetened fruit juices ‘for children’ contain quantities of colorants, artificial sweeteners and preservatives. Since these are only promotional product labels and the marking ‘for children’ does not have any binding European legislative framework, producers can cheat consumers with clever advertising. The EU must use legislation to encourage producers to supply food that is free of pesticides and other toxic substances. Infants, young children, the elderly and diabetics are particularly at risk, even from small quantities of toxins or chemicals in food. Other consumers should also be able to make a conscious choice for healthier foods. Foods must have visible and accurate information about their ingredients on the packaging. Formulations such as ‘no added glutamate’ or ‘no added preservatives’ say nothing about the quantity and content of unhealthy substances in foods. Regular monitoring of compliance with the rules should be an essential component.</p>

      <p sl="en">One of the main objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to achieve a 75% employment rate among people aged 20-64 years by 2020. Unemployment in the EU is at historic highs. Almost 24.5 million people are out of work. This is more than 10% of the economically active population. National governments must take measures to boost economic growth, create new jobs and maintain sound public finances. The EU must be equipped with a broader and more effective set of policy instruments to ensure its future prosperity and a high standard of living for its population. The economic recovery plan implemented in 2008 helped to mitigate the shocks caused by the economic downturn in our economies. Coordinated support was provided to the Member States that needed it, and measures were also put in place to protect the stability of the economic and monetary union. I firmly believe that the EU needs a well-defined policy approach that will promote economic recovery, restore the health of public finances and, above all, actively promote sustainable growth and jobs. In the effort to escape the crisis, however, job creation is one of the most pressing problems. It is certainly our duty to promote employment and help people find work, as is strengthening the coordination of our economic policies, which are absolutely essential for the new sustainable growth programme.</p>

      <p sl="it">Unfortunately this is not the first time that the Commission has risked depriving European citizens of important tools to protect their health for the sake of simplifying current legislation. In this case, we would not have been able to accept that the revision of the legislation on special food did not include products created specifically for people with coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is not a ‘trend’; it is an illness that affects 1.1% of European consumers. The only recognised treatment to date is a gluten-free diet, which can only be guaranteed with a precise regulatory framework and strict control of products. Coeliacs must strictly exclude this substance from their diet for their whole lives and need true ‘substitutes’ for foods which contain gluten. The replacements must have an equivalent dietary profile and taste in order to compensate for nutritional deficiencies and guarantee a balanced nutritional intake. I hope therefore that the Council accepts Parliament’s request and starts a constructive discussion for the second reading of this important piece of legislation, so the expected legislative simplification does not merely have the effect of trivialising this illness.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Ries report has fulfilled its primary objective by providing consumers with the appropriate information on food for special medical purposes and food intended for infants and young children. We have managed to achieve greater clarity in the qualification and labelling of foodstuffs that are of key significance for certain groups of the population, such as infants and young children, as well as patients requiring special diets. Particularly valuable are provisions which incorporate into the regulation gluten-free food and food used in low and very low calorie diets, as well as the exclusion from the composition of categories of foods of any substances that are liable to be harmful to the health of the groups of population concerned. Provisions concerning foods intended for low birth weight or premature infants who cannot be fed breastmilk or standard infant formulas are particularly significant. Such foodstuffs will have to comply with the criteria applied to food for special medical purposes. The recommendation to limit pesticide residues in food for infants and young children is another significant change.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The implementation of these provisions will have implications for food business operators producing this type of food, since change to labelling will be necessary. The Commission has provided for transition periods during which it will be possible to use packaging labelled in accordance with the current regulations. This report will help make European society healthier, reduce administrative burdens and contribute to fair competition between businesses throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I read with astonishment that the European Parliament agrees with the opinion incorporated by the Commission into the explanatory statement that people with diabetes should have the healthiest possible diet, and that there is no scientific basis for stipulating special food requirements for these people. As someone who knows at least a bit about the matter, I almost fell over after reading this. I think it is as absurd as the other statements concerning other diets which exclude specific types of substances from food that is suitable for people who have to follow these diets. In my view, the regulation therefore fails to meet the basic requirements which people with specific restrictions expect from such legislation. It is good that food for infants and young children is specified. It is also right that people who have a gluten-free diet are mentioned. I cannot accept, however, that other groups of people who have very strict limits on certain elements in food are left out of the regulation. I hope the Member States will make a suitable response.</p>

      <p sl="de">Formerly a niche market, the ‘special diet’ sector has grown significantly in recent years. It is often difficult to differentiate between normal and ‘vitamin-enriched’ foodstuffs for certain target groups. A number of important points need to be made in relation to baby foods. We need top quality foods that adhere to animal protection principles, a ban on pesticides, particularly in products of animal origin, such as milk, as well as stricter controls on advertising. Parents often feel coerced into buying a particular product because advertising suggests – sometimes falsely – that otherwise their baby will not develop correctly. For this reason, such information must be approved by paediatricians or midwives. Finally, we also need democratic control by the European Parliament, particularly in relation to definitions and ingredients.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is to be welcomed that the issue of food intended for infants and young children and food for special medical purposes has been considered in such detail by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Protecting children and sick people and ensuring their safety and welfare must remain the objective of our work. It is therefore unacceptable that the current EU legislation allows pesticide residues to be present in infant formulas and in foods for children under three years of age. Allowing children to consume toxic products, especially at such an early stage of development, can have irreversible harmful effects. Pesticides for which the highest acceptable residue levels were approved in the directives adopted in 2006 and which do not comply with safety criteria should be categorically withdrawn from the market and should not be used in the production of food covered by the regulation under discussion. As a matter of urgency, we should also apply the ban on the use of pesticides in foods of animal origin, such as milk, and introduce a requirement for stringent production checks, especially on food intended for young children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a further important issue concerning food for special medical purposes which has not been clarified in the proposed regulation, and which concerns the 32 million Europeans who suffer from diabetes. Unfortunately, the regulation does not provide an appropriate legal framework for foodstuffs intended for persons suffering from diabetes. This primarily involves introducing mandatory and EU-wide harmonised labelling of food products describing their composition in terms of the risk they pose to the health of persons suffering from diabetes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Danish Presidency informed me some weeks ago that there will be no fresh reading agreement on my report on a multiannual plan for west of Scotland herring.</p>
      <p sl="en">This follows a similar blockage in Council on the implementation of Pat the Cope Gallagher’s report on a multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel, which has been log-jammed for the past three years. A report by Ms Bilbao Barandica on a multiannual plan for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay has been similarly blocked.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a pattern which has emerged not only in respect of fisheries reports, but across all the work of our parliamentary committees where delegated acts and implementing acts have been disputed.</p>
      <p sl="en">My understanding is that the Council refuses to accept that, under the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon, it no longer has the sole right to determine such matters. I have suggested in my report on west of Scotland herring that, via delegated acts, the Commission will evaluate the implementation of multiannual plans in full consultation with the Pelagic RAC, the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas and the Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. Parliament and the Council can veto the Commission recommendations under delegated acts. The alternative is to use implementing acts which give the Council more say in the evaluation of multiannual plans, but in this case Parliament can only give advice to the Commission and – of course – our advice can always be ignored.</p>
      <p sl="en">It appears that this blockage in the Council is emanating from the official working groups, rather than from the Ministers themselves. The working groups are determined to retain ownership of all multiannual plans through the use of implementing acts under the terms of Article 43(3) TFEU, which gives them sole competence. Parliament and the Commission are demanding the right to deal with these multiannual plans under Article 43(2) TFEU, under the ordinary legislative procedure. Even the Council’s own legal services agree with Parliament and the Commission on this issue, but the Council remains steadfast in its opposition to delegated acts and the blockage seems set to continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">In respect of the current reform of the common fisheries policy, this legislative blockage is very dangerous indeed. To bring stability to the market and to provide fishermen and processors with the necessary long-term security that high levels of investment in the industry require, multiannual management plans must be introduced for the main commercial stocks. How can we argue that there is not enough money in the EMFF to reintroduce subsidised new-build or modernisation for EU fishing vessels when we are unable to offer our fishermen the reassurance that they can borrow large sums of money from the bank to build or modernise their own vessels based on multiannual plans for fisheries management. No EU bank, particularly during the current economic crisis, will lend a fisherman up to EUR 2 million to build a new white fish vessel, unless he can show that there is a multiannual stock management plan in place that will give a concrete assurance of sustainable fishing over a long period.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current situation is untenable and puts at risk the entire CFP reform process. If we end up going to the European courts to resolve this crisis, which looks increasingly likely, it could derail the entire timetable for CFP reform, and it is worth noting that we have no legal basis for a new reformed CFP after 1 January 2014. It is essential, therefore, that we resolve this issue. I look to the Cypriot Presidency to knock heads together in the Council to end this legislative log jam.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, and the Committee on Fisheries for their work on this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this proposal, we are aligning the management plan for west of Scotland herring to the Treaty of Lisbon. As with previous management plans, we again face the risk of an institutional disagreement between Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that Parliament is fully exercising its new rights under the Treaty. As my colleague, Commissioner Damanaki, has said before, the Commission fully shares Parliament’s position that multiannual management plans should be adopted under the ordinary legislative proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank Parliament for supporting the Commission’s empowerment to adjust parameters in the management plan in case science evolves. This will help ensure that the management plan is adaptive and reflects at all times the best scientific information available.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to refer to some specific amendments. First, regarding the definition of the stock and the area covered by the plan, the rapporteur’s proposed amendment is acceptable. Second, regarding the duration of the empowerment for the Commission, the proposal of a three-year renewable empowerment period is acceptable. However, the management plan foresees a four-year cycle for its review and evaluation. Therefore, it might be useful if the two cycles coincided.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to react to the proposed amendment whereby the Commission, before adopting delegated acts, would have the obligation to consult the Scientific, Technical, and Economic Committee on Fisheries and the North-Western Waters Regional Advisory Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the Common Understanding on delegated acts, agreed by Parliament, Council and Commission in May last year, the Commission must ‘carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level’ before adopting delegated acts. The proposed amendment would go beyond this obligation and would limit the Commission’s discretion to seek the best advice in each case. Therefore, we are unfortunately not in a position to support this amendment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, because his report also dealt with the central situation of fisheries policy in Europe, illustrating this with the example of herring stocks west of Scotland.</p>
      <p sl="de">At present, we are discussing how we want to work more effectively within the common fisheries policy from 2014 to 2020. It has certainly become clear yet again that these Atlantic stocks can be effectively managed with appropriate catch quotas, enabling the highest possible sustainability yields to be achieved. We are doing all that we can to ensure that our fisheries stocks continue to provide the basis for the social and economic survival of our fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">At present, we are discussing discards. Should we not make more efficient use of the resources the sea provides? We are considering the issue of transferrable fisheries rights. What happens with small enterprises when the question finally arises of whether to give up the business and retire, or whether to pass it to a successor? Of course, we also have a situation where we want to develop regional fisheries, bringing them on with appropriate management plans, so that not everything is centrally regulated, but that we also take up a clear position here and say: we in the Regional Advisory Council should not only take advice from the scientists, but should also listen to the experience of local, professional fishing communities. Mr Stevenson has also done some excellent work in teasing this out. Once we have a precise definition of the herring stocks, of course also taking into account migration patterns, then we will have achieved a good result. I offer my very sincere thanks to everyone involved.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Stevenson for his excellent work and the structure he gave to his report, which addresses the two main issues. This is not a simple management plan for herring, but is about guaranteeing fishermen a future to some extent, and a plan of action that ensures the sea is protected for years to come.</p>
      <p sl="it">But the key point in this report is – and remains – the question of delegated acts. I believe that the Council should accept the line taken by the Treaty of Lisbon and I think that the time has come for Parliament to have the courage to take a very clear and strong position on the matter of delegated acts, with perhaps a more authoritative voice than would come from the debate in the Committee on Fisheries or a discussion on a report concerning herring. We assert the right to deal with these matters under the ordinary legislative procedure. I know perfectly well that this issue concerns not only many other kinds of fishing, which will be in a worse situation following the current reform, but also agriculture and other subjects. The right course is to respect the will of Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate Mr Stevenson on the preparation and presentation of his report. I fully support the recommendations contained in the report and, in particular, the need to consult with the Pelagic RAC and the STECF on a regular basis. The advice and input of stakeholders is invaluable and results in greater compliance and support for sustainable fisheries management.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur explicitly refers to the ordinary legislative procedure because of the Council’s refusal to respect the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. As Commissioner Dalli has said, there is an interinstitutional disagreement. Is it a question of the Council not being prepared to cede power? The loser is the fishing sector and sustainable fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the rapporteur for a similar report dealing with the long-term management plan for Atlantic and horse mackerel, I too have experienced exactly the same problem. This is, of course, a crisis and must be resolved sooner rather than later. It does not appear that it is going to be resolved in the mandate of this Presidency but, having met with the Cypriot Minister yesterday, I hope he will take ownership of this and try to resolve it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In relation to horse mackerel, the Council favours the removal of all references to the harvest control rule which is, of course, so important because mackerel is known as a determinate spawner and the harvest control rule is the one which we should follow. Ironically, while I agree on a TAC and quotas for horse mackerel over the last few years, the Council have adopted this principle but will not accept it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In relation to the meeting in Luxembourg of 12 June 2012, I have observed how certain Ministers have spurned the outcome of the Council meeting. The manner in which some Ministers completely ignored the role of Parliament as a co-legislator does not bode well for the negotiations which lie ahead on the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we all support the minimisation of discards as this is in everyone’s interest. The position adopted by the Council in this case is flawed. Avoidance, minimisation and escapement in the first instance are key. Landing dead fish does not contribute to sustainable fisheries management. We must endeavour to avoid the fish in order to allow them to survive, grow and provide fish for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am disappointed that the Council is not here today, because our problem and our difference is with the Council, not with the Commission. I hope that it gets a very clear message from this morning’s session that it must engage with us and resolve this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Fisheries, and that is not a frequent occurrence on fisheries issues, which can be highly controversial at times.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our rapporteur says in the report that his report is about safeguarding Parliament’s rights under the Treaty of Lisbon. The fact is that the Treaty of Lisbon has created a confused and unsatisfactory situation in relation to fisheries management decision-making.</p>
      <p sl="en">The CFP reform process provides an opportunity for us to re-examine and radically change the whole structure of fisheries management by sweeping away the over-centralised methods which have so badly failed us in the past. Instead of obsessively safeguarding the rights of EU institutions, we ought to be designing a framework of decision-making which will actually work, and which will succeed in its objectives. In my view, that means maximum decentralisation so that Europe’s fishing nations can be empowered, working together in logical sea basins to conserve stocks for their own long-term benefit; and yet the Commission claims that the Treaty of Lisbon prevents them from proposing as much decentralisation as they would like. Parliament’s legal services take a different view. The result is confusion and endless wrangling about EU institutions’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that this Parliament, as part of the CFP reform process, will put the preservation of fish stocks, and therefore fishing-dependent communities, first, before this obsessively protectionist view on our own input and our own centralised management systems which have miserably failed in the past.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) warned a number of years ago that the Treaty of Lisbon would cause major problems for the Member States. We were ridiculed, but we are seeing again today that we were right. When it comes to the European fisheries policy, the Council had control over quite a few issues, but, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, that authority has now also been given away to the Commission. This is a cardinal error, as we will see.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are herring swimming around in Scotland’s coastal waters, and lots of them. The Commission now needs the authority to determine the maximum fish birth and death rates. If the herring decide to move to another area, the application of the plan must not be jeopardised.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this is truly too crazy for words. If this Parliament believes it can regulate the biological characteristics of herring it has completely lost the plot – whether on the basis of the loathsome Treaty of Lisbon or not! This fact will just be observed one more time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">While we are on the subject, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) believes that all EU fisheries policy should simply be brought back into the competence of the Member States. We believe this because the Member States would do a much better job, as we can see again today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Stevenson for his report. This report on the multiannual plan for the stock of herring distributed to the west of Scotland is testament to the important role Parliament has to play with regard to multiannual plans in the codecision procedure. I am pleased with the importance granted to the multiannual plan in this reform which is in progress. It is a common sense approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Within the framework of this reform, our number one objective is to preserve resources – some of my fellow Members have already said this. This objective can only be achieved hand in hand with professionals from the fisheries sector. On Tuesday, the Member States voted in favour of banning discards of fish. This sends a very bad signal from the Council. However, as I recall, Parliament codecides this reform with the Council. The zero discard policy, as proposed by the Commission, is unrealistic and dangerous for fishing activity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I would suggest to Parliament, personally, is a significant but progressive reduction in the number of discards. Rather than adopting a dogmatic stance, the solution to this problem of discards can only be reached using a pragmatic approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the Commission’s plan suggests putting in place transferable fishing concessions. This proposal alone represents a very serious threat to our fisheries model. The Commission wants to put resource management back into the hands of the market alone. I think that it is up to Member States to decide on how fishing rights should be managed, as is already the case elsewhere. We will not achieve an effective and fair reform by weakening fishing activity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at 4.30 yesterday morning, Ministers in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council finished their deliberations on the common fisheries policy and put great emphasis, for hour after hour, on the need for a fishery-by-fishery approach based upon multiannual plans. Of course, all this was a chimera, a nonsense, a fraud, so long as they continue to block the creation of these multiannual plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council wants to be able to continue to allow Ministers to set TACs and quotas each year because they have been a brilliant success over the years. We know they have – every year they have met in December and set TACs and quotas above the scientific recommendations, which is the reason we have such a depletion of our fish stocks today. Not surprisingly, some Members of this Parliament would like to tie the hands of Ministers a little and commit them to long-term management plans that make some sense, but we recognise what the Treaty says, and there was a genuine dispute between the powers of Parliament and the powers of the Council which must be resolved, and will only be resolved by us getting round the table and negotiating. Struan Stevenson said that he was looking to the Cypriot Presidency to put this on the agenda, but I look to the Danish Presidency. You have two weeks. I do not ask you to seek a solution, but what I do ask the Presidency to do is to come forward with a procedure for reaching a solution. The sooner the Council and Parliament sit round the table and start negotiating, the sooner we will be able to put multiannual plans at the heart of a sensible fishing policy.</p>

You just said that there is, in fact, depletion of fish stocks, but, as this article shows, that is absolutely not the case. How is that possible?

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, according to the Commission, there are now some 20 fish stocks in the whole of the European Union which are at maximum sustainable yield. This is a huge improvement on the situation of previous years where there have been virtually no stocks at maximum sustainable yield. Twenty out of 250 or so is progress: small, but progress nonetheless, and I believe – though others who know the Scottish situation better than myself can comment – that herring are one of the fish stocks which are currently in a better state than hitherto.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Stevenson, Scottish herring is very popular and is sold and consumed in the Netherlands as ‘Hollandse Nieuwe’, which means literally ‘New Dutch’. Our herring season began on Saturday with flag day. Well, Mr Stevenson, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. What can we say? This year, the quality was outstanding, the herring was juicy and had a fat percentage of 18%.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The total allowable catches have been set at a low level for years now, and we can now see that there is a lot more herring than ever expected before, and in that fact, at the same time, is also what I want to say. The scientific quality of these forecasts needs to, and indeed can, improve, for which reason it is good that Parliament is also demanding a right of control. There needs to be more control, and not only for the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is important that we, Parliament, also exercise these rights stemming from the Treaty of Lisbon, as stated in the Stevenson report. Things can be improved, and they must. Mr Stevenson has adopted the right approach and we should just persist with that position. Even if we talk until the cows come home, Parliament has these rights and so we just have to persist with that position.</p>

Commissioner Dalli, you said that you were accepting – and I am grateful to you – most of the amendments in my report, but you were a bit worried that we were going too far in asking the Commission to consult with STECF, ICES and the Pelagic RAC. I think it is absolutely essential – and you have heard this from many of the speakers in this debate – that the stakeholders themselves must be consulted. It is avoiding consultation with the stakeholders that has led to many of the problems in the fisheries sector.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission has listened carefully to the concerns that many of you have raised concerning a soft landing in a liberalised milk market. There are three main issues that should be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first relates to a faster liberalisation of the milk sector by means of more flexibility in the quota scheme. The second concerns the territorial balance of milk production after the removal of quotas. The third concerns the current market situation with growing production and falling prices in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the need for more flexibility in the quotas scheme, the purpose of increasing national quotas by 1% each year and adjusting the milk fat correction factor was precisely to enable farmers to gain experience in adjusting supply to demand. This has indeed been the case, and, for the EU as a whole, milk deliveries in 2011-12 have remained below quota.</p>
      <p sl="en">The conditions for the phasing-out of quotas were decided in 2008, with the objective of allowing sufficient time for operators to adapt. It would make little sense to change the rules now. The Commission will present a report to Parliament and the Council at the end of 2012 on the development of the market situation and the conditions for phasing out quotas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn to the issue of the territorial balance of milk production in the Union. As you know, the Commission is committed to maintaining milk production in all areas as far as possible. In view of the expiry of milk quotas, measures to support the restructuring of the dairy sector have been included in the list of new challenges and EUR 0.7 billion have been earmarked to support the restructuring of the dairy sector. The regional effects on milk production will be analysed in a report due by the end of June 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to refer to the current market situation. Dairy prices have been particularly high in 2010 and 2011. However, over the past few months, the trend has reversed and prices have dropped. This is not surprising as it coincided with the seasonal peak of EU milk production while other main world suppliers increased their production as well. Prices today are lower than they were some months ago, but are still substantially above intervention levels. Against this background, it would be inappropriate to describe the current situation as a crisis. Besides, the standard safety-net mechanisms, including private storage and public intervention, are open and available to operators who have proposed butter for private storage so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the latest market information available, prices seem to have bottomed out, and some are even trending higher already. We hope that this trend is confirmed in the weeks to come. Be assured that the Commission is following the market situation carefully, and will not hesitate to take the appropriate measures should these be required, even if this does not appear to be the case at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as I have said, I like Commissioner Dalli and I thank him for being here, but I am a little surprised that the Commissioner responsible for the common agricultural policy (CAP) has not made the effort to come and present his views on this debate. His views have been expressed, and I must tell you that I do not agree with the Commission at all and that it would make no sense to change the rules at this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to territorial balance, it is true that you have made an effort. However, as far as the situation in the market is concerned, to say that we are not in the middle of a crisis, to talk about the private storage that is available, is all well and good, but I believe that many dairy producers are experiencing difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have stressed in particular that this political agreement on the CAP health check reached in 2008, which provides for the elimination of the quota regime in 2015, nevertheless left a very bitter taste for many Member States, including my own. We accepted the compromise on the condition that measures be taken in good time allowing for a smooth transition from the quota mechanism towards a liberalised production market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet the measures that have been taken are not enough because, at the moment, quotas are being used in some countries but not in others. This means that the competitive environment in the single market is unacceptable because some producers who exceed their individual quotas are sanctioned and others are not, simply because they live a few kilometres apart, separated by a border.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Cioloș must take measures, particularly to reduce taxes in order to progressively and smoothly reduce the existing unfair competition between European producers. The Commission has a monopoly on such measures. It must take action and we demand that it take action.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, you talked about three concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is the accelerated liberalisation of the sector. You can say that again! In all markets, accelerated and unbridled liberalisation leads to deregulation, which causes extreme price volatility, which is the greatest source of insecurity for the agricultural world. The increase in flexibility of 1% per year did not help as, in an unfavourable market context – I remember what happened in the autumn of 2009 – this led to the most serious crisis to hit the sector in the last 25 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second concern is territorial balance. This must be ensured and that is not the case at the moment. You spoke of restructuring measures. Restructuring means that production will disappear in less productive areas. Yet we must do the exact opposite. We must back up our words with actions, maintaining production in less favourable regions too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third concern is the current situation in the market. It is falling in on itself, and this is not necessarily due to seasonal peaks; there is clearly growing instability in the milk market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wanted to ask you a question, Commissioner. We talk about a ‘soft landing’ for the current system. Should we also be talking about a ‘soft take-off’ and asking the Commission to ensure that the new system, which we have tried to put in place and which will soon take over from the previous system, is safe for all European milk producers?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since it was decided to abandon the milk quota, people have been watching you closely, Commissioner, to see how you behave and what action you are taking to exit the scheme in a rational way. Is there really any pattern discernible here?</p>
      <p sl="de">We have had a year of regional over-production and a rise in global production, which is hardly surprising since there was previously a shortage on the market, leading to higher prices. In addition, over the last two years there has been a rise in operating costs of about 20 %, principally due to direct and indirect rises in energy costs. The market reacted in the normal way to the increased supply and came under pressure. This caused prices to drop. The market is now stabilising again because the farmers are displaying an ability to manage the market and are slowing their production more than is usual for the season.</p>
      <p sl="de">The criticised price decreases have led to a rise in demand in the market. The decline in the euro exchange rate promotes marketability in the global market, making European dairy produce competitive. In the case of cheese, stocks have been reduced to such an extent that more milk is now needed for cheese production. In other words, this is a normal market cycle.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now we come to the Commission: if the market is working, why do we need a super levy? Is its sole purpose to acquire funds for the EU? Has the time perhaps come to put the super levy on a European footing, finally transferring it from a national administrative level?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that both the Commission and Ms Riemers have lost touch with reality a little. Anyone suggesting that this is not a crisis, just a seasonal surplus, has obviously not been watching the markets in recent months. We have witnessed a worldwide increase in production, with a rise of 3.5 % in the USA, 10 % in New Zealand and 3 % in Europe, even though sales are stagnating. I fail to understand how this phenomenon can be explained away as a seasonal surplus.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are on the verge of a crisis. We cannot wait for prices to reach a level of EUR 0.20, in other words until intervention becomes necessary. We need to respond now, because the recent crisis, as everyone must be aware, has cost us EUR 500 million in export subsidies and direct assistance to farmers. Do we intend providing funding again if we find ourselves in the same situation? I believe that this is quite impossible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Hence my question: where do the Commission’s responsibilities lie? I am confused to hear the Commission continue to claim that the quota is not filled, so that there is no scope for changing the rules, nor is this necessary. The quota increase was part of the problem because it brought more volume onto the market. The fact that we still have no answer for what is to happen after 2015 is proof of the poverty of ideas among the Commission and the Council, because milk producers will be abandoned to their fate. The dairy package that we have agreed is in danger of complete failure, because by the time we get around to helping the producers there will only be a few of them left. On the other hand, the dairies and retailers are becoming increasingly concentrated, so that dairy farmers have fewer and fewer ways to influence the market price. For this reason, I should like to ask why the Commission does not respond by bringing its report on the dairy sector forward by one year. Why not discuss market regulations for the period beyond 2015 now? The Commission has still failed to provide an answer in this regard. What we are saying quite clearly is that markets require regulation and this is particularly the case in the dairy market. As long as we ignore this fact in discussions, we are steering a course directly towards a new milk crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">While it seems that prices have steadied to some degree in recent weeks, no-one can claim that the problem is over. It is obvious that events in the global dairy market have an immediate effect on the livelihoods of producers and processors in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council took, many years ago now, the decision to abolish milk quotas in 2015 – and I was the rapporteur for the dairy package which will be implemented when quotas come to an end in the Member States. But I have this to say that I am not convinced that the legislation will prove to be an adequate replacement for the quota system, for many small dairy farmers will be left very vulnerable in the face of quota abolition. Voluntarily it will not disappear, and we need to be prepared to respond faster and faster response mechanisms, which we have not seen to date.</p>
      <p sl="en">There must also be enhanced cooperation between the producers and the processors in the industry if the industry is to stabilise and realise its full potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">Within the overall framework of the CAP reform, we should ensure that adequate market measures are put in place to protect producers against this extreme volatility.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all speak about, or have heard of, the ‘soft landing’ and I have to say, quoting the former Commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, that this has proved to be a nightmare for the Commission in the long-term.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, may I finish with a point. Let us not talk ourselves into feeling that things cannot be made better. They can be made better if we all work together.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the UK diary sector is unique: cooperatives are less important than elsewhere and we have traditionally consumed much more fresh milk. A few years ago I would have added that we alone have doorstep delivery, but that has declined in a decade from nearly half the market to just 5 %. It has been killed by the supermarkets and that is because the British supermarket chains form a complex oligopoly so powerful that it is impossible for suppliers to negotiate as equals. They use their market power to relentlessly dominate and take a greater share of the value.</p>
      <p sl="en">The milk package was a chance to address this. I am not getting at Jim Nicholson, but it cannot work, because the most important element is missing from it. The whole supply chain from farm to jug is what counts and if the retailers are excluded from this you may as well not bother. What can British farmers do now? They must use the Ombudsman to best effect: to challenge supermarket power; and they must not assume that relentless expansion in cow numbers is the way ahead.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot help but be very surprised that the Commission can say that things are improving for milk producers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, milk prices have increased a little at times, but production costs have increased significantly more than producer prices, and putting an end to quotas will plunge our farmers into competition where small and medium-sized farms will not survive and production will become even more concentrated. At the same time, collection and processing will also become more and more concentrated; that is already happening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not too late to stop jobs and regions from being destroyed by these changes. In order to do so, we must return to mechanisms for regulating production and setting base prices which cover the real costs of production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From this point of view, a European milk agency would be useful for providing a continuous evaluation of milk needs and ensuring respect for producer prices, which are valid for all producers. We must put a stop the double price we are currently paying for putting producers in a global economic war.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, I am very pleased that you are here because I know that you are always sympathetic to our concerns. It is very good that you should be made aware of the problems of milk producers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Opinions differ on the milk quota, even within my own group. I often find myself in agreement with my colleague from Luxembourg, Ms Lulling, however we differ on this point. We, the nine representatives of the German conservative group (CSU) from the last electoral term, already voted en bloc against increasing the quota in 2008. The esteemed Commissioner at the time, Ms Fischer Boel, understood the term ‘soft landing’ to mean an increasing of the quota. Increasing the quota means more volume and more volume means lower prices. This is a fairly simple formula. This is precisely the problem we are faced with at present because there are farmers in the European Union who are delivering too much quota, causing a distortion in the milk market.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am against reducing the super levy or increasing the quota even further, because dairy farmers also need some contractual security. The quota will be phased out on 31 March 2015 and we need contractual security by then.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need other important systems, Mr Dalli: fixed payment deadlines, net-net prices and binding supply volumes. These are the key points we need to work on in order to prepare for a market without quotas.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I am fully aware that one of the reasons why we have approved the ‘milk package’ is precisely to adapt the sector with a view to a market without milk quotas in 2015.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also the case, however, that as this date for liberalisation approaches, uncertainty is increasing within the sector, as there is no clear exit strategy, and the reasons behind the sector requesting caution and thought about our decision also increase. Reasons, for example, like the belief in maintaining vineyard planting rights or maintaining sugar quotas until at least 2020; reasons such as uncertainty in the sector surrounding the real effects of the ‘milk package’ and whether we have had time to assess them properly; and also reasons such as uncertainty about where the common agricultural policy is heading, and in particular, its budget, that is, about the part of the income that does not come from the markets and which affects our farmers.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Commissioner what we are asking you to pass on to Mr Cioloş is that we should not undertake a patchy policy, dismantling our protection system, without a serious and rigorous analysis, as the effects on our farmers are irreversible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Postpone the end of the quota until 2015, to a date the sector feels more assured about, and initiate an open and transparent debate on the regulation mechanisms, given that the markets are increasingly unfair and the farmers are increasingly less protected.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, after relatively buoyant prices through 2010, is it any wonder that production rose dramatically and we are now seeing the market oversupplied and prices starting to slide?</p>
      <p sl="en">The ability of milk producers to turn on the tap has never been easier. The ability to put extra feed into big Holstein cows and knock out a thousand litres per head is just so easy. This is a reflection of the market signals indicating better returns. The question Scottish milk producers are asking is whether this is the start of a long-term slide or just a blip in the market as it evens out. We will have to wait and see.</p>
      <p sl="en">The biggest concern of Scottish and UK producers has been that of the constant UK price being lower than the rest of the EU. Again, in 2011, we are 11.8 % below the EU price. Part of the problem is the power of the retailers – which one of my colleagues has already alluded to – but another part of the problem has been poor returns from the manufacturing sector due to lack of brands and lack of value-added products.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the last few weeks we have seen huge changes in the UK market as Arla, the Danish Farmers Co-op, has taken over Milk Link and now controls 25 % of the UK market and Müller has bought Wiseman and now controls 16 % of the UK market. It is hoped that these companies, with their strong brands and their large export markets, will help address some of the fundamental problems that we have had in the manufacturing sector and act as a balance against the power of the retailer when it comes to purchasing milk.</p>

At the present time, dairy farmers live in great uncertainty as to what will happen after quotas are abolished. We do not have convincing economic analyses in this area, and this is yet another agricultural reform in Europe that is being carried out in a manner akin to jumping into a swimming pool without having checked if there is any water in it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The introduction of milk quotas in Poland put an end to milk production in small farms, and their abolition will most likely result in the collapse of medium-sized farms with only very large farms remaining. On the one hand we seek to support small farms in the future agricultural policy, but on the other we destroy them through our irresponsible market measures. We expect the European Commission to perform more in-depth analyses and to show greater responsibility for the future of milk production in Europe.</p>

We still know too little about what will happen when this reform is launched. We want to support small farms in line with the direction of future agricultural policy. We want to create better conditions for these farms, but the market reforms in question run counter to this objective, as abolishing quotas will undoubtedly do most harm to small and medium-sized farms, which will not survive.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, dairy farmers are currently facing a very difficult situation. Tens of thousands of farmers have been forced to cease production, but things may get yet worse, with the sector even largely disappearing in certain countries, even in some that are currently self-sufficient, such as Portugal. The reason is simple: it is due to the liberalisation of the sector and the increase in production quotas, which are being scrapped in 2015.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we warned at the time and experience has borne out, the announced landing has been anything but soft. Despite attempts to pull the wool over our eyes, there is only one reality: the free and deregulated market that they advocate will mean a split in production within the EU, which will tend to concentrate production even further in certain countries and certain large producers. The others will be gradually crushed by production prices that do not even cover production costs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The situation is all the more serious because they want, at the same time as scrapping instruments for regulating production and markets, to prolong the scandalous imbalances in the distribution of common agricultural policy payments between countries. It is therefore vital to reverse the decision to scrap milk production quotas. These should instead be adapted to the needs of each Member State and to their relative level of productive capacity. We need to put a stop to dumping between Member States, and to establish market production regulatory measures to guarantee farmers fair prices for their produce; prices that, at least, cover the costs of production. That is the simple issue to which so much legislation has been unable to respond.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the dairy market is one of the central markets of the European Union and I believe that we witnessed this during the most recent crisis in 2009/2010. I might point out, however, that there are parts of the EU, like the mountainous area I come from, where the dairy market plays a central role. If the farmers in these areas are unable to produce milk, they have no alternative livelihood. What are they supposed to produce on their meadows and pastures if they cannot produce milk? How are they supposed to generate an income, if not with milk?</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Dalli, I think that the restructuring you refer to may work well in some parts of the European Union, because alternatives exist there. What scope for restructuring exists for farmers in mountainous areas, however? For them, restructuring generally means locking the cowshed doors and closing down their businesses. I believe that this is why people in these areas feel under pressure and worry about what is going to happen after the quotas are phased out.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are fooling ourselves if we believe that the solution here is to strengthen the first or second pillar. Farmers cannot live on this in the final analysis. That is why we need intervention in the market with regulatory measures. I could certainly envisage special assistance programmes for producers in these difficult mountain areas, for example, after the quotas have been phased out. If we fail to do this, then we cannot agree to allow the milk quota to be phased out without further ado.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, favourable conditions and more possibilities for production have led to substantial increases in the amount of milk produced, creating critical situations of surpluses and low prices in the milk and dairy market. Many regions with strong production potential have placed those surpluses on the markets of other countries at a reduced price, putting even more pressure on producers from those countries to lower prices. One example of this has been French milk, sold in France at double the prices that it was sold in Galicia. Today, with the sharp rise in the cost of raw materials and production factors, farmers are seeing their capacity to resist low prices severely reduced. This is a bad omen for many of Europe’s farms and productive areas, and seems to be a clear harbinger of what a future without quotas and suitable instruments for regulating supply might look like.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore call for a detailed audit of the regional impact on the thousands of farms across the EU of scrapping these instruments, which currently regulate supply.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, much has been said today about territorial equilibrium or territorial balance. At this point, we must also mention the unequal situation between producers and farmers from Western Europe and those from the countries which did not become EU Member States until after 2004. Farmers in the latter countries are less organised and may suffer most from the future changes. The Commissioner said that we have billions of euros to support milk producers. This is a good thing. However the worry is whether this money will be sufficient and, more importantly, whether it will be distributed fairly. I sincerely hope that this time farmers from certain countries, let us say the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as other countries, will not be treated unfairly, as is currently the case with direct payments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for a very clear message here this morning that the Commission is not for turning. It is not what I wanted to hear, but at least it is clear. I think we should say to dairy farmers in several Member States, including my own of Ireland, that this is the position as of now.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I am not going to be defeated and just accept the Commission’s word. There are a number of Member States which are farming States, and those people who want the situation to remain as it is should remember that they are paying 56 million to the coffers of the European Union, despite the fact that the European Union is producing milk under its quota at the moment. This is neither fair nor just, and we need to look at reducing the super-levy charge on these farmers.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also could and should look at the butterfat correction mechanism to make some adjustments and perhaps frontload the quota increase. So, while you are not for turning this morning, Commissioner, please take back some of my ideas to your colleagues and see what might be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I say generally, on the issue of quotas – which is the broader issue here today – please remember that when we had quotas, the milk price collapsed in 2009. So quotas did not save us from a milk price collapse. Also, it is dangerous for Europe to say that we will restrict production while the rest of the world expands production. We are losing opportunities. We need a more sophisticated debate. We need to protect those vulnerable regions where we want to have production – and we can do that through various mechanisms – but let us not retreat within the European Union at a time when the medium- to long-term prospects for dairying are positive.</p>

Was it not always a major political error that this instrument was insufficiently used, in other words that volume was not reduced when there was too much milk on the market? Was it not also an error that politicians were never brave enough to use the quota to halt overproduction, so that milk prices dropped as a result?

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I hope I am getting the sense of your question. I mean, I do not mind who is at fault. I think we have an issue here. Dairy farmers want certainty. They have been told that milk quotas will be abolished by 2015 and they were told there would be a ‘soft landing’. We know one of those two things will be delivered on. We have not delivered on the ‘soft landing’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am saying that there is an opportunity for the European Union to produce milk in a sustainable way and to feed into global demand for dairy products. It seems to me that our debate this morning is stifling that possibility. I want dairy farmers to understand what the Commission has said, because Irish farmers are paying a super-levy bill of EUR 11 million. They are young, they are enthusiastic and they are those who are our future. They are being penalised for all of those things and I regret that that is the case.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Blue-card question . – Mr President, Ms McGuinness, the fact that the quota system has coincided with a sharp drop in prices – and I see that the Commissioner is nodding in agreement, because the Commission often makes this argument – does not mean that the quota system has failed, but simply that the quotas were not properly adjusted to the precise needs of each country, its level of production and its relative productive capacity, so as to prevent certain countries from flooding other countries’ markets. All it has demonstrated is that the quotas were not set at the levels that they should have been; it does not demonstrate that the failure of the quota system. Indeed, perhaps you can clarify for us Ireland’s plans for increasing milk production over the coming years, Ms McGuinness, as it will be one of the countries with most to gain from the abolition of the quota system. There are already plans for a very considerable increase in milk production, so perhaps you can elaborate on some of those plans here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I could answer with a question, but I will be much more direct on this issue. The milk quota system failed to protect farmers from income price collapse in the past, which means that system failed. We have made a decision to scrap it. I wish we would not start talking about possibly changing that decision unless we are clear that can be the case. The decision has been made.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of milk production, my point is this: if the European Union, and Ireland as a Member State of the European Union, can produce milk competitively – and we supply Europe and beyond – we should be allowed to do that in a sustainable way. I am arguing here not against your point, but against this negative view that we restrict our production all the time, which has worked against us.</p>
      <p sl="en">The quota system has introduced rigidity and high costs into our system. We can – using politics as Peter Jahr said – have a milk production system in Europe that feeds the global demand.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, if nothing is going to be done until the quota scheme expires in 2015, the high quota values will prevent the more productive farmers from enjoying new opportunities, whereas the least productive in disadvantaged areas, especially mountainous areas, would be faced with major problems due to a significant drop in prices as a result of the abrupt removal of the quota scheme.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This situation naturally raises the following question. Should measures be taken, and if so, what kind, to ensure a slow transition to a market policy in the dairy sector before the milk quota scheme expires on 31 March 2015?

We need to ask serious questions about whether it is fair to continue to impose heavy penalties on individual dairy producers. When we hear talk of a ‘soft landing’, then this needs to apply to all measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to pay particular attention to the areas that have no alternatives to milk production. I demand clear support for our disadvantaged areas. These regions cannot survive without milk production and livestock farming. The dairy market requires clear ground rules.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not fool ourselves. The quota system of recent years has not delivered a sound price guarantee. I think that the Commission needs to take good decisions for the whole European Union, and I therefore see three actions that are necessary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Those production areas that are currently armour-plated in the quota system and that will be moving overnight from the quota system to a quota-free system need to be guaranteed a soft landing. We were promised that much. We need to do something to ensure that that happens. Commission, look beyond your previous limits and do something via fat correction, or make it possible to use the capacity still available in Europe as part of the total quota.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As a second point, I call on the Commission to make it possible for vulnerable regions, such as mountainous regions, to provide additional support via the first or second pillar. I say this because I also do not want to see Alpine cows disappear, but that is a structural problem, rather than just a market mechanism problem.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, Commission, I call on you to now, finally, ensure a fair distribution of margins in the chain. Look at the powerful position of the supermarkets and ensure, for example, that it is forbidden right across Europe to sell things below cost price. In some countries that is already the case, and it should be the case right across the Union, certainly in respect of primary food products.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first like to address the Commission. Of course I do not agree that all is well for our dairy farmers. Quite the opposite is the case. You should visit Austria to see how our alpine producers are struggling to survive. If we are to avoid destroying the livelihoods of many dairy farmers, then we need to retain milk quotas in order to regulate market volume. Otherwise our alpine farmers will be forced to close down because they simply cannot withstand the competition. It is not possible to produce milk in massive volumes in Europe’s alpine regions as farmers in the flatlands of Ireland or the Netherlands can. We need comprehensive EU-wide supply; milk should not be transported from one end of Europe to the other, but should be produced locally in the various regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, from a pan-European perspective, the abolition of the milk quota would also place enormous import pressure on the European dairy market. For this reason, the milk quota needs to be recalculated, as the fact is that, at present, exceeding national quotas by even small amounts can incur penalties measured in millions, despite the fact that there is underdelivery on the overall milk quota at present. That cannot serve any purpose. Finally, we also need an EU-wide price corridor derived from the full cost of production. This would enable a fair price to be determined, both for the producer and for the consumer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I just have a quick question for Mr Obermayr. You stated that the quota is pretty much the solution to the problems. How then would you explain the fact that the pricing situation in 2008 and 2009 was so dramatic, despite the existence of a quota for our dairy farmers?

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, firstly I would like to thank my colleague for crediting me with expertise that I naturally do not have, as I am not an agricultural producer. However, I have numerous friends in the region who cooperate with me as consumers and who keep me well informed. I can only recommend to my colleague that she should also pay attention to this group and not just to the producers and professional groups; after all consumers and interest groups also count.</p>
      <p sl="de">You may not have listened to exactly what I had to say: I referred to a price corridor, which means that we need to make prices dependent on production costs. This is a fair approach because, as you will admit yourself, production costs vary greatly depending on whether a producer is located in an alpine region or a flatland location. If we take this into account in our calculations, we are sure to come up with a rational solution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I believe this debate has exhaustively shown that we are not satisfied with what is happening in the European milk sector. There is major volatility, as there has been in the past, and given the measures that have been taken so far, it can only be surmised that the sector will remain volatile in the future. My position on quotas is known all too well: I believe that they are absolutely crucial, but that they have not been used in the proper way to regulate the market effectively. If we are to move towards actually scrapping the quotas, it is necessary and indeed imperative that some sort of market regulation take their place. Otherwise, we run the risk of being without milk producers, particularly in certain countries, not least those of southern Europe. The milk package was designed in such a way that it does not properly serve the southern countries, and regions heavily dependent on the milk sector, such as the Azores, run the risk of complete devastation to their agricultural economies, in addition to social and demographic issues. I call for all decisions to be made based on a holistic vision of the sector and forward-looking regulation.</p>

      <p sl="es">I am going to list the problems faced by the sector, however: firstly, the price of milk. It is at rock bottom, especially in my country, Spain, compared with that in France, for example. Secondly, an industry that abuses its position of power and the farming crisis. Thirdly, an industry that tells its farmers that there will be a contract, but that they will set the prices and that, also, those prices will remain the same. Fourthly, a depressed sector with no outlook that does not know where to turn for a solution. And lastly, milk in the supermarkets of unknown quality.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the dairy sector is suffering a major crisis, in which public intervention is the only way of guaranteeing minimum prices that cover production costs and maintaining a network of sustainable dairy farms.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, I come from a dairy-producing region, Galicia, which is the main milk-producing region in Spain. In my region there are 10 000 small farms dependent on milk production. These create 60 000 jobs, whereas 10 years ago there were 30 000 jobs. The low prices paid to producers, which do not cover production costs, are scandalous, as are the agreements between companies and distributors within the industry on paying at below the cost of production.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I have added my criticisms of the milk sector in Galicia to the proposal to scrap the milk quotas system in 2015. We call on the Member States and the Commission to take responsibility for continued regulation of production that addresses the challenges of maintaining employment and wealth levels, as well as the land, demographic and environmental balance, in order to ensure a milk sector that can guarantee consumers a quality product.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the current dive in milk prices has not materialised out of thin air. In fact there have been clear warning signs for some time, offering plenty of time for political action to prevent this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The dramatic decline in milk prices in recent weeks and the simultaneous rise in production costs – as we know feed, fertiliser and diesel prices have all increased – have pushed milk producers to the verge of ruin. Thus, many dairy farmers really are fighting for survival.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, demand for dairy products is declining because consumers in many southern European countries can no longer afford milk and dairy produce in the quantities purchased prior to the euro crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thus, common agricultural policy reform is hugely important, particularly in the context of the current crisis in the dairy industry, because a massive decline in farming could indeed undermine the self-sufficiency of the EU Member States. Clearly, those worst hit by this are those in disadvantaged areas, such as the outermost regions, but also farmers in mountainous regions like we have in Austria, on whose behalf the EU must finally take action.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, after the quotas are phased out in 2015, a major change will take place in the dairy product sector. New legislation is aiming to increase the negotiating power of dairy producers so that they can obtain the best price. In this regard, their involvement in producer organisations still ought to be encouraged. The dairy product sector is the only one in agriculture where producers can negotiate their price collectively. This ensures a fair standard of living for farmers and rational production development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although Romania does not have many large farms involved in processing milk, my country appears halfway in the ranking of the biggest dairy producers in the European Union. They need to be supported and protected during the period after the quotas are phased out to ensure a stable future for the sector.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we are debating this issue here because there is a real problem in European society. The milk sector is once again being affected by a very difficult cycle of falling prices, and we politicians must find solutions, so that anxiety does not become a permanent state of mind for milk producers. This sector is of great social importance, so we cannot look at it solely from the competitiveness point of view. If we go down that route, total liberalisation and the lionisation of the market would clearly resolve the problem, but we also have to think about it from a social perspective.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The 2003 decision to scrap the quota system was made at a time when the craze for liberalism was at its peak. Over the last few years, we have seen that this is not the right remedy for the problems facing the European economy, and the debate here has also shown that we are now curbing common agricultural policy reform, with an growing tendency to extend the quota system to other areas, such as sugar and the right to plant vines. In other words, we cannot be liberal in one area, yet advocate intervention in another.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission must therefore reflect on why the solutions adopted have not been able to resolve this major problem.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we are currently experiencing a situation where production is increasing by more than 2.5%. At the same time, industrialists are lowering their prices. In Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and throughout European countries, prices are falling. This clearly means that prices are linked to production volumes and that we must organise production volumes as well as prices.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, today, producers are falling victim to an increase of more than 44% in the price of vegetable proteins and 30% in the price of cereals. Parliament has already voted on the need to ensure that added value is distributed among producers and that farmers do not become the victims of companies and large-scale distribution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore ask the Commission today, but also the Council, to once again call into question controls on production, but at the same time, and I say this very clearly, Member States must get their own house in order because there are countries which have respected the quota rules and others which have not. This is another reason why these quotas have been called into question. There is therefore a double responsibility on the part of the Commission and the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have three comments to make. Firstly, we should be honest enough to admit that the milk quota has failed as an instrument for stabilising prices. This was not the fault of the farmers, but rather of the politicians, who have always allowed more milk quotas to be issued than the market could actually bear. This was also the reason why Germany, for instance, once again opposed the recent move to increase the milk quota, despite the fact that demand had not risen. A price drop was the logical consequence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I worry about how we can support entrepreneurship among our dairy farmers. This requires market monitoring, forward-looking market decisions and active interest groups. Although these are standard practice for pig farmers and cereal producers, there is a need for the dairy sector to catch up.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I would simply ask that milk production should be supported not just in disadvantaged areas and mountainous regions, but also in grassland areas: the second pillar does not fulfil the requirements here, as producers cannot possibly fulfil the extensivisation criterion, that is to say we cannot support milk producers from the second pillar because they have too many animals per hectare. Here too we need to make the necessary changes to the agricultural reform.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I had not intended speaking in this debate, but just want to make three points:</p>
      <p sl="en">First, looked at objectively, the fact that farmers in Europe have to pay a EUR 56 million super-levy, when Europe as a whole is under quota, makes absolutely no sense. What does it say about solidarity? What does it say about the single market? Certainly it does not say much for political decision-making.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the decision has been made to abolish quotas post-2015. That should not be changed. We have the same carry-on with the sugar beet quota, trying to change that abolition as well. It takes a long time, particularly for dairy farmers, to plan for expansion into the future, and those already planning need the certainty that there will be no change in those decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the world population is seven billion as of now, and expected to rise to nine billion over the next 20 or 30 years. With the same amount of land and more food needed, this is an opportunity for farmers to expand. As my colleague Mrs McGuinness said, are we going to leave it all to New Zealand and the US and disadvantage our own farmers? It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are two points I did not get a chance to make: one referred to a comment from Ms de Lange and my colleague Mr Agnew on supermarkets and prices. This is an issue which we need to look at, not just as regards dairy products, but also as regards fairness in the food supply chain. We are looking forward to the Commission’s report on this matter because it will feed into how farmers survive, not just in mountain regions, but right across the European Union. I support your efforts in that regard, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the point of regional and territorial balance, I think this House generally supports the idea of family farming in the European Union and farming on a territorial basis. The dairy farms which I refer to in Ireland are family farms and we too, in our country, want regional dairy production; we do not want concentration with any particular region. I repeat the point that quotas may have given certainty and volume, but they did not give dairy farmers certainty on price or income in the bad times.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you; I asked to speak because we still have some time left. I will be brief.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like everyone who talks about the absolute freedom of the milk market, whether from my own group or from other groups, to take the following to heart: from 2015 onwards we shall also have to discontinue the historical payments per hectare. We cannot have a situation where milk producers in Latvia receive EUR 100 per hectare, while producers in other countries receive over EUR 1 000 on the basis of historical premiums. This does not constitute fair competition. A milk producer who receives compensation payments of EUR 1 000 per hectare can sell his milk to the market at a lower price, thus distorting the market. That cannot be allowed to happen. Starting from 2015, we must pay the same hectare premiums for all milk producers in the first pillar. We can expect some interesting discussions.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second comment relates to the market: we need to strengthen the position of producers and processors in relation to the retail sector. I fully support this. We cannot have a situation where milk producers and processors have to pay premiums and listing discounts and payments are delayed by periods of up to 100 days. Commissioner Dalli, we need to step in here to strengthen the position of producers and dairy farmers as a whole.</p>

At the same time, all the other ‘hard discounters’ have just done the same thing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Thank you for your question, Mr Bové. I myself am the president of a large dairy cooperative that markets milk for 7 000 dairy farmers and only the dairy farmers themselves have a say in the business, in other words the directors and the members of the supervisory board are all farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, we do not have enough leverage in the market to impose our prices on these wholesale chains. What we find particularly disturbing, and what causes prices to drop, are the unfair methods employed by others. There are no net-net prices. Discounts have to be given at the end of the year. Listing fees are demanded in the interim. In other words, it is impossible to compare the prices paid by the retailers because they are undermined by these systems. The Commission should look for clear-cut systems that would make the whole system more transparent and easier to understand. This would also allow us to protect our own interests more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I believe that the present problem is not that we do not have enough milk, but rather that we have too much. The problem is that some farmers are supplying much more than their quota permits. The aim of Ms Lulling and a number of other colleagues is to abolish or reduce the super levy. I disagree with them on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">This provision lasts up to 2015 and a number of dairy producers have spent money in recent months in order to purchase quotas. These people would be penalised if we were now to do away with the entire system. We must provide contractual security.

I have listened carefully and I assure you that I will pass your varied comments to my colleague, Dacian Cioloş, who by the way is not here because he is on official business in China.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that the milk sector is a very important part of our agricultural policy. That is why the Commission pays close attention to developments in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the quota, some of you want a ‘softer landing’. Let me add a few words to what I have already said. I am aware that in 2008 Parliament asked for a more flexible approach by ‘setting of quota’ at EU level. This was not adopted because it would have had an uncontrollable and unforeseeable impact on dairy production. Instead, a 1 % annual quota increase over the period 2009-2013 was retained.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some others want to keep the quota system beyond 2015. I want to make three remarks concerning this point. Firstly, we have recently put in place the Milk Package, which is our first response to the concerns about the quota system being phased out. Secondly, the phasing out of quota will end a rigid milk production system which has hampered farmers from gaining experience in adjusting supply to demand. Thirdly, the Commission will come up with a report by the end of 2012 with an assessment of the market situation and the conditions for phasing out the quota.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to the market situation, I would like to remind you that dairy product prices have been particularly high over the past two years. Over the past months, the trend has changed. This coincides with the seasonal pattern of milk production and prices and is reinforced by milk production in the Union and in the other main milk-producing regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prices seem to have reached bottom and some are even trending higher already. In any case, safety-net mechanisms are available for operators who so far have only proposed butter for private storage. This is a good sign of confidence in a positive evolution of the market.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Belonging to a single market does not mean equal opportunities for EU farm producers. Milk quotas are due to be phased out after 2015. However, we have no idea as to what kind of instruments will be adopted to ensure the proper functioning of this market. I have seen that dairy producers are extremely vulnerable and, even though there have been intervention tools available, we have experienced crises in the sector. I am not sure that small farmers in Romania will have any chance of survival in a deregulated dairy market. This is why I call on the Commission to reconsider phasing out milk quotas in 2015 in order to guarantee stability and predictability in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I have two important announcements to make. I would ask for your attention for one moment, please.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On Tuesday, I informed you of the impending trial of Sakharov laureate Ms Mahfouz, who has been charged in Cairo. You will remember that I said that the European Parliament had sent a message of solidarity to Cairo in relation to the proceedings against this young woman. I would like to tell you now that the case was heard yesterday, that Ms Mahfouz has been acquitted and that she has expressly asked me to tell you that she believes the pressure from the European Union was of extraordinarily great importance in this case.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, I must inform you of a decision by the Conference of Presidents, which was adopted a few minutes ago. This morning, the Conference of Presidents, that is the chairs of the groups in this House led by the President, held a very detailed and intensive debate in consultation with the Legal Service of the European Parliament in relation to the action taken by the European Council last week and the unilateral decision of the European Council regarding the Coelho report on the evaluation and monitoring of the Schengen mechanism, changing the legal basis from Article 77 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which provides for the codecision procedure of Parliament, to Article 70, which provides for a solely intergovernmental procedure, in other words a resolution by the governments in the form of the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In response to this extraordinary move to change the legal basis in a unilateral way, the Conference of Presidents decided to suspend cooperation with the Council on home affairs and justice until the Council reaches an agreement with the European Parliament on a joint procedure in relation to the Schengen issue. The reports in question include the report on the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code and the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement – known as the Papanikolaou report – the report on procedures to prevent attacks on information systems – known as the Hohlmeier report – the report on the European Investigation Order – produced in the trialogue procedure – the report on aspects of the 2013 budget that relate to internal security and the report on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement. The Conference of Presidents decided not to continue with these five reports or to carry on with their adoption or negotiate them further with the Council until an agreement has been reached on the Schengen issue. I would like you to be aware of that.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">In the interests of fairness I must also add that Mr Callanan voted against this on behalf of his group, while all other groups voted in favour.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I believe it is only fair that we should mention this. On a personal note, I would like to add that in my 18 years as a Member of Parliament I have never witnessed such unanimity on an issue facing this House. I should also add that Mr Speroni abstained from the vote on behalf of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I must also tell you that some of the reports already adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that were scheduled for the July part-session will not now appear on the agenda. The first of these is the report by Mr Coelho, which is the report for which the legal basis has been changed. The second is the report by Ms Weber, which deals specifically with the increased reintroduction of border controls and the increasing of control times for the reintroduction of border controls. Neither of these reports will appear on the agenda in July and have been dropped by the Conference of Presidents.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council regulation on the multiannual plan for the herring stock was adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty and therefore an alignment is needed. This regulation, the first in the fisheries sector to be aligned to the Treaty, is therefore of great importance as the solution adopted in this case could affect the decision-making procedure that will be applicable to other multiannual plans.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament has two dimensions. The first is substantive. There can be no objection to the substantive dimension. Of course it is important to monitor herring stocks too and to take appropriate measures if these become overfished.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other dimension is just as important, however, which is why I have given my full support to this committee report. The question once again is when to work with delegated acts and when to initiate regular legislative procedures. I expressly support the rapporteur’s view when he says that the delegation of powers to the Commission must be temporary because, in the final analysis, the issue at stake is where the real political power lies, with Parliament or with the Commission. I still consider that Parliament should not blithely devolve rights to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain our views on this particular issue. I would like to congratulate Mr Stevenson, my ECR colleague, on getting this vote through and for the support he obtained. But actually, when you look at the common fisheries policy overall, it is quite clear it has been a failure. It has been an exercise in central planning: it might as well be called a Communist fisheries policy because it has led to unsustainable seas with not enough fish stocks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Surely the lesson we should be learning as we go forward with any fisheries policy is that in the best ones – the ones that have worked, the ones from Iceland, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands and other areas – you have a fisheries policy based on property rights which can be traded on, which families can inherit, trade on or sell on. That way there is an incentive to maintain the stocks in a sustainable way, rather than this sort of Communist, centrally-controlled fisheries policy, which has actually led to the depletion of our fish stocks and to disaster. It is time we moved towards a market-based approach.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report on the stock of herring distributed to the west of Scotland. I fully support the proposal in the report that scientific organisations should be playing a more fundamental role in the modification of the multiannual plan. In my view, the Commission should be required to seek advice and to consult bodies such as the Pelagic Regional Advisory Council and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries before it makes any changes to the multiannual plan as suggested.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is vital that we preserve these fish stocks, and any advice that can be gained on mortality rates and associated spawning stock biomass levels from the experts will surely help the Commission in reaching an evidence-based decision and more suitable regulations ensuring that these vital marine stocks are managed effectively.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from Seveso to Bhopal to Toulouse, numerous environmental disasters have struck Europe in recent years and put the health of European citizens at risk. Mr Áder’s text deals with the revision of the Seveso II Directive, which seeks to contain the effects of these incidents involving substantial amounts of dangerous and highly polluting substances released into the environment.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we look back at some of the serious environmental disasters we are all familiar with, we can see that there have been numerous cases where disastrous environmental consequences have followed industrial accidents. These cases also show that at times the impact of accidents can extend beyond national borders.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have voted in favour of my fellow Member’s proposal since I believe Directive 96/82/EC must be replaced so that the existing protection levels are not only maintained, but strengthened. I also think that the new provisions should be clearer, consistent and easily understandable, in order to contribute to the streamlining of administrative procedures. Finally, I would argue it is necessary to keep a certain amount of flexibility to be able to amend Annex I to deal with any unwanted effects of the alignment to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and any subsequent adjustments to that regulation that could have an impact on the classification of dangerous substances.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report, because it is very important to inform the public about major disasters when accidents happen. Nor should the public be left in the dark about the causes and consequences of major accidents. If we allow the risk of accidents to be underestimated, we endanger people’s safety and health.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is therefore only right to tighten legislation. Operators will now have more responsibility for providing information. Public awareness will also increase as a result of the assessment and monitoring process to take place every four years.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the accident that occurred in Seveso, costing the lives of many people, showed how important it is to take preventive action against industrial accidents too: the primary aim is to prevent such things from happening, while the secondary aim is to ensure appropriate safety measures are in place if accidents do occur. This is also the reason why these directives were named for Seveso. We have had Seveso I and Seveso II, and now we have Seveso III. This places an obligation on operators and the authorities in Member States to avoid accidents. According to the regulations, operators are required to put a multi-level strategy in place that is more stringent the more hazardous the materials. Precise plans are required for production facilities and must cover toxic substances, evacuation plans and employee training. The current directive covers about 10 000 businesses. This number alone is an indication of the importance of the issue. It is for that reason that I have always supported this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it does seem odd given what is happening outside this chamber – the bank runs, the economic crisis – that we are spending time talking about major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, but then it occurred to me that there is a certainly grisly aptness in this report. The most dangerous substance of all turned out to be the euro!</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not mean that in a literal sense – while I understand that some people did have an allergic reaction to the particular kind of alloy used in the coins, even I am not going to try and turn that into an argument against the single currency. What happened was that our leaders, so taken with their dream of political union, disregarded all of the economic danger signs with the calamitous consequences that we can see around us today: poverty, preventable deflation, emigration, despair and the prospect of endless tax rises, all because we were so in love with this dream of ever-closer union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report as the likelihood of serious accidents needs to be reduced. Such accidents, like the pink sludge spill in Hungary in 2010, must be prevented in order to contain the adverse consequences for man and the environment. Although the directive seems to work well, it needs to be revised to improve its enforcement and reduce the administrative burden involved.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The most important amendments are aimed at access to information and public involvement in the decision-making process. A high level of protection is required, and reviewing the directive should be aimed at achieving this. In this context, I should stress how important access to justice is. Informing the general public is also vital because it will lead to establishing a climate of trust. As long as the public receives clear, accurate information, it will be able to take the appropriate measures in the event of major accidents.</p>

I am very pleased that we have actually looked at this issue, but in the context of the wider economic situation it is also important that we look at some toxic and hazardous substances there.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should look at the issue of toxic debt and why governments have been spending more money than they had coming in and therefore got themselves into a difficult situation. We should be looking at the issue of moral hazard, where we are now trying to encourage banks or governments to build up lots of money in case a bank fails. That just creates a moral hazard, because why would you act responsibly if you know there is a pot of money there waiting for you?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Something else that is important is the target group in the report, those growing children who are very vulnerable consumers, on account of their age. Obesity in children is endemic and a serious cause for concern throughout Europe. Studies have incontestably shown that advertising and the content of advertising targeted at children shape their consumer behaviour.</p>

I am in favour of these views, because we all know that the role of company advertising is primarily to promote sales, and not to provide consumers with information. Amid fierce competition, many companies will stop at nothing to boost profits. Most foods marketed to children also contain a good deal of fat, sugar and salt.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in June 2011, the EU Commission presented a proposal for the revision of food law according to which specific regulations will only exist in future for foods intended for infants and small children and foods for special medical purposes. Something that might sound very good at first – and I am all in favour of simplification – turns out to be more problematic in practice. Various people need to adhere to specific diets and require specific information. I am genuinely very grateful to our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for having resolved this conflict. On the one hand we do not want misleading advertising, while on the other we require sufficient information. Thirdly, of course, we do not need excessive information. Once again, thank you to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which has asserted itself and come up with a solution that can work in practice. Otherwise, the principle still applies: it will, of course, be possible to review whether the report is going in the right direction. Thank you once again, I found myself able to vote in favour of the report as a result.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report, which I think is one of the most important votes held on a report today. It was not only the case that directives dating from before 1974 needed to be amended and adapted, but the fact that this report is aimed at one category of vulnerable consumers is totally relevant. These consumers are frequently victims of inaccurate advertising and labelling. This is why a number of conditions are developing which are much more difficult to fight.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the provisions targeting gluten intolerance because this intolerance has led to the development of a condition which, unfortunately, is prevalent in a very large number of European states at an alarming rate. I am talking about coeliac disease. This report also deals with this condition, attempting to suggest measures to combat the relevant condition.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I think that this report must be followed up by other measures for implementing it and monitoring how it is put into practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our supermarket shelves are stacked high with food claiming to cater for specific needs. There is specialised food and drink for infants and old people; there are products for those trying to lose weight as well as those trying to gain weight. Customers deserve a choice, but they also need to understand what they are buying and consuming.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report calls for clearer and simpler rules for the labelling of so-called diet products. I hope that when Member States implement this legislation it will lead to a reduction rather than an increase in red tape. The new legislation should also facilitate – rather than prevent – small and medium-sized companies from accessing the market. Consumers need clear information and companies need simple rules to allow them to compete effectively. For these reasons, I support the report.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Ms Ries. We must thank her for an excellent report, and it is very important, when we talk about infant formulae and food for children, that all the relevant information is truthful, accurate and scientifically proven. Furthermore, it is very important to ensure that we do not engage in any kind of image advertising.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Otherwise, I would say with regard to this report that, as far as coeliac foods are concerned, coeliac products could have been dealt with separately in their own report, although in this context they obviously fit in, as the legislation obviously now needs to be updated in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On the whole, this represents an excellent improvement. Altogether, 35 years have passed since the previous legislation was enacted, and, for that reason, it was high time we brought in new, up-to-date legislation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I support the rapporteur on what I believe is quite a proportionate document that improves the current situation. It is also important to say that current EU legislation recognises that breastfeeding is best for infants and that from six months infants need a diversified and safe diet.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I voted against Amendment 86, which seeks to severely restrict advertising of infant formula and follow-on infant formula to specialist baby care magazines and/or scientific publications. This is going much too far. It restricts consumer choice – not many consumers purchase specialist magazines or scientific publications. It would also ban television advertising, and this is neither proportionate nor reasonable. I agree there should be a clear distinction between infant formula and follow-on formula, but not a virtual ban on advertising. While Member States may decide to further restrict advertising, an EU-wide ban on advertising infant formula and follow-on formula, with the exception of the magazines I mentioned, is not proportionate.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the rules on the labelling of the contents of baby milk and foodstuffs for people with special health problems should be tighter and better defined in order to protect consumers. It should be noted that, with this type of food, misleading labelling can harm the health of consumers. Stricter regulation is therefore appropriate. Its task is not to deprive a person of choice, but to ensure that his choice is based on clear, comprehensible and accurate information. I therefore think that advertising for these foods should meet the higher ethical standards. Stringent controls of compliance with them should be in the natural interest of the producers themselves.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, linguistic diversity within the European Union may pose problems with regard to both information and public administration activities. Guaranteeing citizens’ rights to public consultation and official measures in a national language is invaluable and necessary for proper co-existence within the European family. Put simply, it will lead to the elements of direct democracy being strengthened in the Member States of the European Union. Wider participation and the involvement of citizens in the public consultation process may serve as an outside sign of constructive social dialogue and political involvement as well as the building of trust towards European politics. In view of the fact that next year has been designated the European Year of Citizens, it is important to raise people’s awareness of the benefits and rights resulting from European citizenship. I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution in the hope of consultations being carried out more widely on the basis of measures taken by non-governmental organisations, and of citizens being guaranteed the right to receive communications from the EU in their native languages.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the right of every citizen to deal with Brussels institutions in his own language is one of the few remaining signs that this is an association of nations rather than a single polity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have very little patience with the argument which one hears very often, even in my constituency, that the EU as a whole – or at least the European Parliament – should adopt just English, or just English and French, or just English, French and German. If you remove the requirement for the EU to produce everything in every national language, you simultaneously remove the biggest obstacle to a superstate.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, we are adopting, if not in the literal sense, something of a common language in the way in which we debate these matters in this Chamber. We use phrases which one never hears anywhere except here: ‘respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality’, ‘bringing Europe closer to the people’, ‘the answer is more Europe, not less Europe’, ‘the people are demanding that we do more’. These are phrases that you only ever hear from Eurocrats and MEPs.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I think that this is a very important motion for a resolution, and I voted in favour of it, because this concerns public consultations and their availability in all the languages of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If the European Union wants to be credible in the eyes of its citizens, it also has to provide all essential information in the language that those citizens speak. Only in this way can we win people’s trust, and I think that this is one area where we must make far more effort to ensure that people receive information in language that is easily comprehensible on the European Union’s role and that of its various institutions. People should be able to have access to all documents and all hearings in their own language.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This lies at the heart of what we need from the EU, and, for that reason, Parliament, as a democratic body, must stand up for the right of the people to have access to all public documents in their own language, and that goes for all hearings and consultations as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, to add another cliché to the long list, sometimes in this Parliament we talk about the ‘democratic deficit’. Well, this is one of the ways of dealing with the democratic deficit. I often say to citizens, you do not just vote for your MEPs: there are other ways and mechanisms whereby you can influence what happens in this Parliament, and one is by being involved in consultation processes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I regularly update citizens and interested groups on the ongoing consultation processes because I believe they are a very useful tool. But it is really important that citizens can communicate in their own language. For example, it is very important that Irish speakers can communicate with the Commission in their own native language. Language is not necessarily the only barrier, however, and it is equally important for persons with a disability to be able to communicate in an accessible format.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I believe the timeline needs to be looked at. If you are big lobby group or a big NGO, a short space of time is enough to get involved in a consultation, but for ordinary people who do not have the same resources at their disposal, consultation periods need to be longer.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, at a time when citizens and politicians are focusing on finding solutions to the financial and budgetary crisis, it may seem that calls for the consistent application of multilingualism are a secondary matter. These two issues are closely related, however. A European identity, which is a prerequisite for mutual solidarity between the Member States, cannot exist without a sense of belonging. If the citizens of some Member States start to feel that Europe does not speak their language, it will not be their Europe. They will cease caring about its fate, the fate of the single currency, and the common future. Therefore, it is today more important than ever that the EU communicates with citizens in all the official languages.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this motion for a resolution because a large proportion of the public consultations touch on vitally important subjects, but the level of participation is generally low. They should be organised involving NGOs, trade unions and the mass media, and should be accessible to everyone. Public participation is a fundamental aspect of democratic governance and should be encouraged. This is why it is vital to provide translation in all the official languages.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Sustained efforts are required to get all European citizens actively involved. At present, consultations are not organised well enough.

It is also important that all consultations are given the same treatment so that they are all accessible to the same degree, but I do not support the multilingual system in our institutions, both for MEPs and officials, as this is too expensive and inefficient. I have no love for the EU Tower of Babel and I believe that three working languages would suffice – namely English, French and German. The UN, with 186 member countries, only has six working languages, and the Council of Europe, with 47 member countries – including all the EU Member States – has only two, and yet the EU, at a time of austerity and cuts, still insists on all 23.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, well if I may continue briefly with my 1984 analogy, we are all familiar in politics with the concept of doublethink: the ability to hold two contradictory views simultaneously in your mind. It comes out in all sorts of ways. For example, a lot of people will be aggressively in favour of the rights of indigenous communities in poor parts of the world to be left undisturbed and yet will be aggressively in favour of immigration and multiculturalism in other parts of the world. That is human nature and I suppose we all do that. But Tibet is a particularly egregious example of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this Chamber we like to pat ourselves on the back for being on the side of democracy, freedom and self-determination, but when we try to apply that same logic to the European Union, the doublethink kicks in. If Tibetans are better off living under their own laws and their own people, then why are not Portuguese or Germans or British people or any other democratic community in Europe? How extraordinary that having developed this idea of national self-determination and exported it around the world, we have turned out backs on it here in the continent it came from.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is vital that the Chinese authorities continue and intensify their discussions with representatives of the Dalai Lama on the situation in Tibet, as a lasting solution can only be found if it is a solution which respects the cultural autonomy and maximum political devolution of Tibet within China.

That is not the right way to go. Our businesses are being stifled by bureaucracy that at best replaces national bureaucracy, but mostly simply adds to it. This will not create jobs.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, all measures aimed at increasing transparency and harmonising legislation in the area of economic and trade affairs have benefited enterprises, enabling them to compete more effectively in the market. The same applies to company law, since there are often barriers in terms of different interpretations of regulations or simply the sheer number of regulations which stand in the way of establishing and running companies, especially in certain Member States. I voted in favour of adopting the resolution, as it highlights the need to undertake initiatives aimed at simplifying procedures in respect of the business environment, and reducing unnecessary administrative burdens. Moreover, I propose that a set of common rules needs to be developed, for example in terms of the protection of subsidiaries and stakeholders, and greater transparency created as regards legal and ownership structures. I also believe that it is necessary to step up efforts to prepare the Private Company Statute (SPE), which is in the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution, because I think company law contributes to the smooth functioning of the single market. It is a key factor that helps protect the rights of shareholders and guarantee legal certainty. The EU needs a regulatory framework adapted to the current needs of companies and which reflects the trends of the European economic environment. I believe we need to harmonise basic regulations and adapt company law for the benefit of both shareholders and customers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Moreover, I wish to draw attention to the extremely important role of businesses in terms of growth and innovation.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I believe the analysis of the Commission Communication on the recovery of jobs presented in this report is important in the current context. I would like to emphasise the realistic approach adopted by the rapporteur in assessing the status of the labour market in the European Union, and highlight two issues.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report mentions that there is no correlation between the products of universities and vocational training factors, and the labour market reality. We are short of engineers, we are short of trade workers, and we are short of technicians. I think it will be necessary to try and focus the professional system, or at least the continuous vocational training system, on skills that better match the demands of the labour market, both at Member State and European level. For this reason, I also welcome the decision to reduce the tax wedge on labour, which is currently excessive in a large number of Member States and makes employment unattractive to public and private employers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe this report is an important one; it is an analytical report that will certainly have to be taken into account and considered by Member States in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ‘towards a job-rich recovery’ is a report title that could really have come straight out of the Ministry of Truth – and I promise that is going to be my last Orwellian reference of the day. We have had all these promises of job-rich recoveries before. We had one when I was a new MEP – it was the Lisbon Agenda, do you remember that? It was going to give Europe the most successful, competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world by the year 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well 2010 has come and gone and, as Sarah Palin might ask, how’s that working out for you all? Then it was the euro. We have forgotten that this was one of the great arguments we were given in favour of monetary union – that it would boost employment throughout the eurozone. Again, how’s that working out?</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we are on to our latest conceit, our latest bit of hubris. The truth is we politicians cannot create jobs; we cannot legislate them into effect. Even if I employ somebody in my office I am doing so with taxpayers’ money which is being taken out of the private sector where it would have been used more efficiently. One thing we could do is stop destroying jobs with pointless, intrusive, pettifogging regulation, to allow the entrepreneurs, who are the real drivers of the economy, to create jobs and employment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I agree with Mr Hannan. It certainly is an inspiring title for the report. The truth is that if we use an inspiring title like that then we have to make sure that we deliver, that it is real. In that context it is very important that this morning we voted to back an investment package which is to create sustainable jobs, because I believe this sends a clear message to citizens that we are now seriously attempting to rebalance the current austerity approach with a Europe-wide pact for investment and jobs. I hope the Council is listening and takes action. I also know that when Irish citizens voted for the fiscal compact that they were expecting such an investment pact as part of the overall package.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the tools at the disposal of the European institutions to boost employment are limited. I believe that the call in this resolution to upskill workers and retrain them is one where there is European added value, and in this context I would strongly call on the Council to remove the blocking minority as far as the continuation of the European Globalisation Fund is concerned and to leave that instrument there to upskill redundant workers.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Under our 2020 strategy we have a target of creating 75 % employment for those of employable age by 2020. At the moment there is about 68 to 69 %, and while 6 or 7 % might not seem a whole pile, when you actually transfer it into numbers it is about 17.6 million jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Certainly a job-rich recovery is required and while, as Mr Hannan and others mentioned, politicians cannot create jobs per se, we can create the conditions. It was encouraging yesterday to hear the points mentioned by Commissioner Barnier in that regard – standardisation, completing the single market, growth of e-commerce etc., and particularly the European Patent. All these taken together can help. Hopefully, by 2020, we will be in the situation of having reached our target of 75 % of people of working age being employed.</p>

There have been numerous discussions regarding the measures needed; the Commission has made proposals, and the Council has taken decisions. It is time to implement them through concrete and effective actions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission should submit a clear report on the EUR 82 billion that were to be directed towards SMEs and youth job creation.

      <p sl="en">Those of us on the right believe that what you need to do is create the right conditions for growth: get governments out of the way of markets; get governments out of the way of entrepreneurs and allow them to create real sustainable jobs – not jobs dependent on governments spending more taxpayers’ money than they have actually got and getting themselves into debt, but the creation of real sustainable jobs in the private sector so that they can then pay their taxes.</p>

Unfortunately, another barbaric phenomenon, justified in some cases by religious options, persists in the 21st century. However, these barbaric practices of extreme violence against women affect 140 million women worldwide and more than 500 000 women in Europe.

This mutilation is not a religious practice, but a cruel, barbaric ritual explained as a tradition. Mutilation causes girls, who are mostly under 15 years of age, unimaginable pain, and leaves permanent consequences for their health for the rest of their lives. Parliament has adopted a second resolution calling on the Commission and Member States to do their utmost to eradicate this inhuman practice. The European Union can do a lot in the fight against violence of this type. It both supports organisations that help victims, and it takes active steps in the planning of development assistance in countries where the practice is still tolerated.

Its consequences are devastating for the physical and mental health of women and can lead to very serious health problems and even death. Although there are laws that prohibit female genital mutilation, it continues to be practised in many parts of the world, threatening to affect 3 million women annually. And some cases occur within the European Union. Even as we speak, a couple is standing trial in France for having mutilated their four daughters.</p>

With an estimated 140 million women and girls worldwide living with the terrible consequences of female genital mutilation, and at least half a million of them in Europe –including, sadly, many in my own region of London – this is a huge issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Though FGM is a traditional practice in the Horn of Africa, it is not a requirement of any religion. It is a barbaric practice performed for the most part on girls younger than fifteen years old, leaving them with very serious long-term consequences and irreparable injuries.

Concrete measures should include strengthening the inspection of products on the market, as well as unannounced inspections throughout the supply chain, increasing accreditation requirements and improving the monitoring of Member States’ authorities. As a doctor, I welcome the fact that it will be mandatory to announce every prohibition, restriction or legal action adopted in respect of implants in another EU Member State.

      <p sl="sk">The objective of the submitted proposal is to amend the Council regulation of December 2008 establishing a multiannual plan for the stock of herring to the west of Scotland and the fisheries exploiting that stock. The core objective of the plan is to ensure the exploitation of the herring stock in the area west of Scotland on the basis of maximum sustainable yield. To attain it, the plan lays down rules for the establishment of the annual fishing opportunities for this stock in terms of total allowable catch. Such rules use certain technical parameters, by reference to which the stock can be considered to be in better or worse conservation status, therefore closer to or further away from the plan’s objectives. These parameters are science-based, not a policy choice. Science may evolve and improve, and the plan needs to contain the necessary provisions to ensure it is kept up to date with the best science available.

Taking advantage of this alignment, the Commission also suggests some other changes, in particular moving the designation of the geographical area that is inhabited by the herring stock in question from Article 1 (‘Subject matter’) to Article 2 (‘Definitions’). Moreover, the currently complex evaluation procedure (evaluation of the achievement of the targets of the Plan every year on the one hand and evaluation of some specific aspects and of the performance and operation of the Plan every four years on the other hand) is reduced to a simpler evaluation of the operation and performance of the Plan taking place every four years.

In this respect, I fully support Mr Stevenson’s position. Let us remember that it is not always straightforward to choose which type of act to use. Delegated and executive acts have an advantage over legislative acts insofar as they provide us with an opportunity to respond swiftly to new situations. The ordinary legislative procedure and delegated acts guarantee Parliament’s participation in the decision-making process. Our voters expect the European Parliament to be involved.</p>

The Commission is in the throes now of ‘Lisbonising’ a number of regulations in the CFP to bring them into conformity with the Treaties and this is one of them. The regulation consists of a management plan for the fishery for herring to the west of Scotland, one of many fisheries for which such plans exist. The plans are, in principle, a good thing since they serve to de-politicise the setting of quotas. Without such plans, the Council is totally free to set quotas as they wish and frequently go far higher than the scientific advice. The plans include a detailed procedure for how to establish a quota, using mathematical rules and based on the status of the stock, and the Council more or less respects those. So that is good.</p>

This must be achieved through the revision of the 1996 Seveso II Directive. I welcome the agreement reached with the Council to adopt this regulation, which recommends, rightly, the introduction of clearer and more coherent provisions, some of the most important of which are the implementation of stricter inspection rules for some 10 000 high-risk establishments in Europe, greater frequency and transparency of these controls, and improvements in public access to information on safety and public participation in decision-making. I should like to welcome these measures, which were adopted by a landslide in plenary and which, in my opinion, are a step in the right direction and send out a strong message.

      <p sl="it">Over the years, the most serious industrial accidents deriving from the loss of control of certain dangerous substances – such as those that occurred in Seveso, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom – have cost many lives and have caused damage worth billions of euros. In order to reduce the probability of similar incidents and limit their consequences, the European Union has adopted the Seveso III Directive applicable to European establishments using dangerous substances (or mixtures) in sufficient quantities to create a major-accident hazard. With the introduction of this directive, the provisions regarding information on safety are reinforced and, more specifically, the managers of all establishments which come within its scope will be required to notify the competent authority and to devise a major accident prevention policy. While welcoming the introduction of new, stricter rules than those in the recent past regarding inspection of facilities, I would argue it is important for us to emphasise how the new environmental regulation as a whole will imply a significant increase in the administrative burdens of European companies.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I support the Commission with regard to improving the level and quality of information and public participation in decision making. The public needs to be well informed and to have direct access to information that is important for taking decisions and acting in emergencies. I agree with the adopted proposal to specify a requirement to explain dangerous substances in simple terms on the Internet, and to indicate when an establishment has been inspected. More detailed and specialised information on dangerous substances and on inspections should at least be made available on request. Member States can then decide themselves whether they consider it appropriate to put more detailed technical information on the Internet as well. I agree with the demands to strengthen inspections and harmonise them with the number of inspections under the Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions, where the period between two site visits must not exceed one year for installations posing the highest risks, and three years for installations posing the lowest risks. Coordination or integration between these types of inspections would reduce the administrative burden related to the preparation, presence of inspectors and follow up. I would like to call on the Member States to support this coordination. The proposed provisions on inspections will help towards better implementation, and thus improve the level of protection, while also - on a broader level - securing a level playing field.</p>

This report, by Mr Áder, concerns major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances. There are 2 000 companies that work with such substances in Europe. The report aims to protect human beings and the environment, and to avoid wasting resources. In fact, major industrial accidents have caused damage amounting to billions of euro. In order to reduce the likelihood of such accidents occurring and minimise their consequences, the EU first adopted Directive 82/501/EEC (Seveso I Directive), and later Directive 96/86/EC (Seveso II Directive). Although the latter Directive has been successful, it needs to be revised because of the need to adapt it to the Regulation on the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of dangerous substances and mixtures. The new rules increase safety and will apply equally to all companies, in every EU Member State.

      <p sl="sk">The directive of December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances lays down rules for the prevention of major accidents that might result from certain industrial activities and the limitation of their consequences for human health and the environment. Major accidents often have very serious consequences, as evidenced by accidents like Seveso, Bhopal, Schweizerhalle, Enschede, Toulouse and Buncefield. Their impact can even extend beyond national borders. This underlines the need to adopt appropriate precautionary measures to ensure a high level of protection throughout the EU for citizens, communities and the environment. This directive has helped reduce the likelihood and consequences of such accidents, thereby leading to a better level of protection throughout the EU. A review of the directive has confirmed that the existing provisions are fit for purpose and no major changes are needed. However, the system established by the directive should be adapted to changes to the EU system of classification of hazardous substances to which the directive refers.

Among the new things to be introduced in the new rules, I would particularly like to focus on easier access to information for the public. Prevention and information are two inseparable concepts. Citizens need to be provided with the tools to become more knowledgeable not only about the risks connected with industrial sites in their area, but also about the possibility of mitigating the consequences of a major accident by adopting rules for self-protection and putting in practice the safety measures given in the emergency plans. The information must be understandable, up to date and timely. In addition, in case of an industrial disaster, constant communication with the people affected through use of the Internet can certainly aid the progress of the operations underway.

To reduce the likelihood and the consequences of such accidents the EU first adopted Directive 82/501/EEC (Seveso I Directive) and later the current Directive 96/82/EC (Seveso II Directive), amended by Directive 2003/105/EC, covering around 10 000 establishments where dangerous substances (or mixtures thereof) are present in sufficiently large quantities to create a major accident hazard.

      <p sl="en">The Commission’s proposal is actually a slightly modified version of the original Directive 96/82/EC. It is good that, particularly for use in land planning and possible use with an integrated emergency system, we have a directive that unifies the method for securing and mapping the information necessary for addressing industrial accidents involving dangerous substances in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of dangerous substances and mixtures (the CLP Regulation). The ordering of Part One and Two of Annex I has changed compared to the original directive. The first part includes a list of categories of dangerous substances and the second part lists the dangerous substances or groups thereof. The nomenclature has changed and toxic substances are now divided into four groups. The scope of the directive is limited, on the one hand, by the exceptions, while, on the other hand, some new substances are classified. One exception includes the activities of extraction industry plants, including gas storage. In relation to oil rig accidents, rigs for oil and natural gas extraction are excluded from the scope of the directive, and the Commission is tasked with assessing the situation regarding the rules that apply here. All of the plants included must have a serious disaster prevention policy drawn up in writing and updated every five years, and obligations to notify the competent authority. In my opinion, the directive marks progress in this area and will help to further increase safety in the handling of dangerous substances. We have therefore supported it.</p>

The proposed revision rightly keeps the level of protection and avoids major changes to its scope. It introduces a new, more sophisticated classification system, particularly with regard to the relationship between human contact with hazardous substances and the attendant health risks.

Therefore, the revision of these preventive measures is more than encouraged and comes at the right time, when one of the main concerns, both at European Union and international level, involves environmental policies. However, in addition to regulating a rigorous classification of hazardous substances and the corresponding precautionary measures, it is extremely important to also take into consideration severe sanctions against those entities that have caused damages.

Unless stricter rules are introduced and strict regulations applied in the area of offshore extraction, I believe there will be more accidents like the one in the Gulf of Mexico or the Jebel al-Zayt drilling platform in Egypt. Since 2010, when media attention was focused on the Deepwater Horizon oil platform disaster, there have been significant oil spills in a further 20 places around the world. The scope of the Seveso III Directive should be extended to oil platforms and oil or gas pipelines on the sea bed or beneath it, and to all phases of oil and gas exploration until after the decommissioning of a well. The inclusion of offshore extraction within the scope of the Seveso III Directive would not only help to prevent serious disasters which threaten biodiversity in rivers, seas and oceans, but would also clearly stipulate that in such a situation the principle applies under which responsibility for a disaster rests with the polluter, who also has an obligation to bear the costs of the necessary preventive and corrective measures.</p>

As a member of the French National Conference on Sport (CNS), I think that we still need to regulate products specifically intended for sportspersons.</p>

      <p sl="it">The proposal for a regulation in question, updating Directive 2009/39/EC in line with legal and market developments, has raised questions over the classification of many products as ‘dietetic’, establishing general provisions for only a limited number of food categories considered essential for certain vulnerable population groups – foods aimed at infants, children and patients under medical supervision. At the same time it has shifted protection for other groups (coeliacs and people who are lactose-intolerant) to other EU legislation and mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In June 2011, the Commission tabled this proposal for a regulation on food intended for infants and young children and on food for special medical purposes. The revision of the legislation is aimed at simplifying the establishment of a single list of substances that can be added to the foods covered by the proposal. The idea is to bring very low-calorie diet products within this Regulation’s scope by including them in the definition of food for special medical purposes. It is essential that the notification procedure, which is faster and less costly, remain the standard procedure, with marketing authorisations granted at national level and an obligation to supplement this procedure with additional rules on labelling and composition. This simplified but more protective legal framework must apply to imported and exported foods alike, and facilitates the application of the precautionary principle. The proper functioning of the internal market depends on this. I voted for this report for those reasons.</p>

For reasons relating to public health and consumer information, we must urgently put an end to this confusing situation. That is the objective of the thorough overhaul of the existing directive, the provisions of which are now obsolete. We should also adopt, as quickly as possible, stricter and clearer rules on the labelling and composition of foods for particular nutritional uses intended for the most vulnerable groups, such as infants, young children and people with specific medical needs, who are clearly not ordinary consumers and who therefore require special attention and common rules within the EU. It is also essential to ensure that labelling reflects reality and does not include pictures which may idealise the use of a product. In this respect, I fully support this report, and I hope that the negotiations with the Council will reach a rapid conclusion.</p>

I am happy with the amendment of the regulation under review, which now also covers food products suitable for people who are gluten-intolerant in order to give them a proper legal framework. I would argue that it is essential for the notification procedure (which is faster and less costly) to continue to be the standard procedure, with marketing authorisations being granted at national level and there being an option to supplement this procedure with additional rules on labelling.

This amounts to pointless bureaucratic interference, which makes life difficult for producers and is completely unnecessary. It is based on the assumption that the consumer is stupid, susceptible to manipulation and incapable independent and responsible decision-making. In my opinion, this assumption is wrong. The average consumer does not make purchases only on the basis of the image on the product, but seeks further information. In my view, rather than prohibiting this or that image on food packaging, we should focus instead on the ingredients and ensure that they do not contain any undesirable chemical substances. This is an area in which legislative intervention at EU level really is necessary.</p>

Another important advancement we have achieved is the creation of a single list at EU level specifying the vitamins and minerals that may be added to foods.

I believe it is vital that the rules on the definition, composition and labelling of foodstuffs for infants, children under the age of three years and people with certain medical conditions, both imported and exported, be checked regularly and applied strictly to ensure adequate protection and food safety to vulnerable groups, such as children under the age of three and patients with special nutritional needs.</p>

I am referring to the protection which, in my opinion, coeliacs deserve as consumers who have less choice regarding what they can eat and who therefore should not be lumped together with other groups of more fortunate consumers. However, I accept the result of the democratic dialogue and appreciate all the more the work carried out by the rapporteur, as long as it translates into a coherent body of law protecting those who need it and encouraging transparency and fairness.

      <p sl="sv">I voted in favour of this report, as it represents a simplification and a clear improvement compared with the existing legislation. There was concern that people who are gluten intolerant or suffer from allergies would not have the same protection, since the original proposal was for this aspect to be removed from this legislation. I feel secure in the knowledge that it is absolutely certain that the protection for these groups will not diminish. It is important that we have harmonised legislation throughout the EU in this area and a common list of what the products that are covered by the legislation are permitted to contain. One issue that aroused debate was the use of pesticides in the production of these foods. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wanted to prohibit the use of these pesticides and even the presence of traces of these substances. I believe this is impossible to monitor, and it would also create other risks. Pesticides are used to ensure that our food is safe, and it goes without saying that we should use as little of them as possible. There is a reason for their use, however. I am pleased that we won this battle and that we will retain and clarify the rules that we currently have in place.</p>

Eventually, the packaging for such products will no longer be allowed to include any pictures of infants or any pictures which may ‘idealise the use’ of these milk-based formulae. Furthermore, the Commission will have to look into ‘growing milks’ intended for children between 12 and 36 months, and more specifically into the complex legal situation of these products. Gluten labelling will also be affected. Food products for people intolerant to gluten should contain less than 100 mg/kg of gluten, and the labelling and packaging should therefore state: ‘very low gluten content’. Products containing less than 20 mg/kg will be labelled ‘gluten free’.

The Commission is therefore proposing to review the framework directive by abolishing the general rules on dietetic foods, but to maintain some of the rules for specific foods adopted under the directive. I agree that it would be best to confine the scope of this Regulation to a limited number of foods for particular nutritional uses. It is obvious that infants, children under three years of age and people for whom a special diet is vital clearly require special attention and uniform treatment within the EU.

In terms of the reference to allergens, the report amends the Commission proposal, as the latter does not provide a suitable legal framework for gluten- or lactose-intolerant people, or those with other forms of food intolerance, as it does not include the nutritional profiles of foodstuffs, which are key to determining whether or not a given foodstuff may be used.

The European Union must commit to achieving uniform treatment in the area of food so as to provide greater legal, economic and social certainty, covering not just the goods consumed and produced within the European Union but also those which are exported and imported. In this sense the regulatory provisions on gluten and lactose are of paramount importance as they are aimed at protecting an ever-growing section of the population.

      <p sl="sk">The free movement of safe and wholesome foodstuffs is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, and to their social and economic interests. The Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 2009 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses lays down general rules on the composition and preparation of such foodstuffs that are specially designed to meet the particular nutritional requirements of the persons for whom they are intended. However, experience shows that certain rules contained in the directive in question or adopted on the basis of the directive are no longer effective in ensuring the functioning of the internal market. I believe that the concept of ‘foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses’ should be abandoned, and the directive replaced by a legal act in the form of a regulation in order to simplify its application and guarantee that is consistent in all Member States. At the same time, I consider it essential to establish procedures for the adoption of emergency measures in cases where foodstuffs covered by this regulation pose a serious risk to human health. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of these emergency measures, the implementing powers should be transferred to the Commission. The Commission should then adopt applicable implementing acts relating to the emergency measures in duly justified cases relating to public health that require serious and compelling reasons.</p>

      <p sl="it">We agree with the Commission that the legislation on foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses needs to be thoroughly overhauled and that the concept of ‘dietetic food’, which in most cases means very little from a nutritional point of view, should be done away with. We believe that industry and the vulnerable population groups involved should be afforded greater legal certainty. This must necessarily involve regular democratic scrutiny by Parliament of the definitions of foods for infants, children under the age of three and people with certain medical conditions, for whom a special diet is of vital importance, and of the rules governing the composition of such foods. This simplified but more protective legal framework must apply to imported and exported foods alike, and makes it easier for the precautionary principle to be applied. If we are to expect the internal market to work properly, we cannot afford to disregard the health of the more vulnerable members of society in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">The proposed Regulation is intended to update, harmonise, and simplify EU rules on specialised food products, namely dietetic foods and foods for particular nutritional uses. The proposal abolishes the concept of dietetic foods and provides for a new framework establishing general provisions only for a limited number of well-established and defined categories of food that are considered as essential for certain vulnerable groups of the population, i.e. food intended for infants and young children. The proposal also aims to create a single legal measure that regulates lists of substances such as vitamins, minerals and other substances that may be added to the categories of food covered by this proposal.

      <p sl="de">Because the digestive tract of new-borns is only capable of killing off germs ingested in food after two or three months, the requirements in relation to the hygiene and quality of baby food must be particularly stringent. It is important that the EU should ban all advertising that aims to discourage mothers from breastfeeding. In some EU Member States it is expressly forbidden to portray ready-made products as being equal in value, or even superior, to breast milk. In practice, the wording used on packaging, in television advertisements and on websites often makes this very suggestion and therefore contravenes EU law and national laws. We need to take a stronger stance here. It is also necessary to ensure that no poor quality baby foods can be imported from other countries. For this reason I have voted in favour of the report.</p>

In particular, I am pleased that we were able to retain specific rules to protect people with coeliac disease, despite a very incomplete and penalising initial proposal from the European Commission in this regard. Coeliac disease is one of the most serious and widespread food-related disorders. In Europe, it is estimated that one person in every hundred is affected by it, and therefore it is easy to see that retaining a specific regulation for people who are gluten-intolerant proves necessary. Therefore we must pay the utmost attention when dealing with these matters, seeking to better inform consumers, especially those most vulnerable, and thereby better protect them.</p>

What unites them is the fact that we want to protect consumers by giving them as much information as possible about products used. Nevertheless, the fact that provisions are scattered across various legal acts causes a certain amount of confusion.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that breast milk is the essential and most natural food for infants during weaning. However, not all mothers have this opportunity, whether for physical reasons or because they do not have the time required. In this case therefore they rely on formula, which certainly has considerable nutritive value, but not enough to be advertised in such a way as to give consumers the idea that formula can replace breast milk entirely. I think it is right, therefore, to ask for stricter and better-defined European rules on labelling of milk for children and of foods for people who need special diets, such as coeliacs, so as to protect consumers and provide clarity for the food industry. The non-medical quality of foods and the difference between foods for infants and follow-on foods must be made immediately obvious to consumers, who are often bombarded with ‘idealised’ images on packaging. I also agree that Member States should have the right to implement even stricter measures, if necessary.</p>

      <p sl="en">Foodstuffs for people with special dietary needs – the so-called Parnuts foods – occupy an area that European Union regulations have covered for a long time. This sector has experienced a significant growth in recent years, as evidenced in particular by a clear increase in demand for the supply of safe and wholesome food. Despite previous attempts at harmonisation, there are still big differences between the national laws relating to Parnuts foods. These differences are an obstacle to the free movement of goods, create unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies operating in the food sector, and ultimately impede the functioning of the internal market. Last but not least, I welcome the efforts of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to highlight in the text the need to include additional groups of products in the draft, specifically milk drinks intended for young children and food for people allergic to gluten.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. There are many key points in the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It supports the Commission approach of abolishing the concept of ‘dietetic foods’, but reintroduces the category of foods for use in low-calorie diets and invites the Commission to assess the need for a specific ‘sports food’ category. It asks the Commission to produce a report assessing the need for special provisions on so-called ‘children’s milks’ and strengthens rules on labelling and advertising. It calls for post-market monitoring and requires delegated acts for updating the list of permitted substances. It provides for special requirements for nanomaterials and more or less maintains current ‘gluten-free’ rules while inviting the Commission to present a report on ‘lactose-free’. It stipulates that the use of pesticides should be ‘restricted as far as possible’ and asks the Commission to update regularly the lists on limitations of certain pesticides, paying particular attention to the very dangerous substances. As the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we agree with the general approach to abolishing the concept of dietetic foods and are opposed to the (re-)introduction of more categories. We have fought for stricter rules on pesticide use, for a ban on advertising/labelling milks as ‘children’s’ (or ‘growing-up’) milks, for specific rules on the use of nanomaterials, and for stricter labelling/advertising rules. We would prefer to have ‘gluten-free’ regulated under the general regulation on food information to consumers.</p>

The Commission’s proposal has been improved by the Members’ amendments, especially those by Italian Members. There is profound ignorance about coeliac disease in various Member States: it is neither a fad, nor an allergy. Coeliac disease is an illness and the words ‘gluten free’ on food products cannot be trivialised as a simple claim or allergen. Coeliacs cannot eat any gluten whatsoever.

Whether it is mothers and fathers buying baby milk or people suffering from coeliac disease (gluten intolerance), we have a duty to protect them from any misleading advertising. It is with this in mind that I voted for this proposal for a regulation. This project is in line with our protection and prevention efforts: in the future, labelling for all milk-based formulae for infants up to the age of 12 months, including ‘follow-on’ formulae, should not include pictures of infants or pictures which may ‘idealise the use’ of the product. What is more, food products intended for people intolerant to gluten should contain less than 100 mg/kg of gluten and be labelled ‘very low gluten content’, while food containing less than 20 mg/kg of gluten may be labelled ‘gluten free’. We have created a Europe of free and unfettered competition between economic actors; we are working even harder towards a Europe that protects consumers from the failings of this competition.</p>

This situation’s lack of transparency clearly calls for an overhaul of the legislation on foodstuffs for specific population groups, starting with infants and children under the age of three for whom a specific diet is of vital importance and who merit particular attention and uniform treatment throughout the European Union. With this vote in favour I express the need for legislative order on this matter to safeguard the health of individuals in the Union based on proper nutrition from birth, therefore guaranteeing that there are no pesticides or any type of toxic substance in foods intended for children and infants or for special medical purposes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I welcomed the proposal for a resolution, however, I have some reservations about this report. Firstly, I would like to highlight the obligation to provide full and objective information on food products. One very sensitive case is the question of the advertising of formulae for infants of 0 to six months and formulae for infants of six months to two years. The facts show that advertising practices tend to concern parents by using marketing strategies rather than providing them with information of a scientific and factual nature, allowing consumers to make a clear distinction in order to avoid any risk of confusion. The health of our children is at risk. Lastly, I think that the Ries report should provide for more effective evaluation mechanisms. This evaluation should not be carried out a priori , only taking into consideration the consumers the products are aimed at, but on the basis of a careful and comprehensive evaluation of all the ingredients of the product in question. The regulation that Parliament will adopt should take greater account of consumer protection and health, and the marketing strategies put in place by the food industry.</p>

This proposal should enable us to establish a clear distinction for consumers and controlling authorities alike.

      <p sl="pt">This report expresses agreement with the Commission’s position on confining the scope of the Regulation to a limited number of foods for particular nutritional uses, with particular emphasis on foods for infants, children under three years of age and people for whom a special diet is vital. Despite excluding from its scope substitute meals replacing all or part of a person’s daily food intake and foodstuffs intended for sportspeople and for intense muscular effort, the Regulation does cover low-calorie diet products, including them in the definition of food for special medical purposes, intended for obese patients, with proper medical authorisation and supervision. In terms of the reference to allergens, the report amends the Commission proposal, as the latter does not provide a suitable legal framework for gluten- or lactose-intolerant people, or those with other forms of food intolerance, as it does not include the nutritional profiles of foodstuffs, which are key to determining whether or not a given foodstuff may be used.

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament following a Commission statement on public consultations and their availability in all EU languages, for a number of reasons. First, Members represent the people of the 27 Member States, who express themselves differently but all have the same rights of access to the documents handled in the EU institutions. Second, public consultations represent an excellent opportunity to share ideas in Europe, and should be moments when the public can participate and truly exercise their EU citizenship. Third, although multilingualism is very expensive, an effort should be made to provide upcoming budgets with the resources to enable public consultations in all official EU languages. Fourth, particular attention is given to citizens with disabilities, and it is advocated that they be consulted through the use of accessible formats. Finally, I welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed designating 2013 the European Year of Citizens in order to raise public awareness of the benefits and rights afforded by EU citizenship.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We voted for this motion for a resolution because all EU documents should be easily accessible and available in all official EU languages. For a long time we have been repeatedly denouncing, in detail, the abuses of multilingualism by the EU institutions. In order for there to be democracy in an EU with 23 official languages, they must all be respected and treated equally. That is not the case at present. The work carried out by Parliament is one example. It is regrettable that the same political groups now acknowledging the importance of ensuring respect for multilingualism in public consultation processes have approved cuts to Parliament’s translation and interpretation services, thereby compromising this very respect for the various languages of the EU. We included this criticism in our resolution. Troubling statements are being made by the Commission and some representatives from the most populous countries, particularly the United Kingdom, saying openly that multilingualism should be respected insofar as ‘budgetary constraints’ allow. We will remain vigilant in this regard in the future, fighting any and every limitation or attack on democracy, in particular by the EU institutions.</p>

It is important that all consultations are understandable to ordinary citizens and are carried out over a sufficiently long period of time to allow for increased participation.

      <p sl="ro">The proposal to designate 2013 as the European Year of Citizens bodes well, just like all efforts to encourage free communication with all EU citizens and their active involvement in drawing up EU policies aimed at and affecting us all. Unfortunately, however, making available the content of public consultations in all official EU languages comes at a bad time, when huge efforts are being made to reduce costs by eliminating items that are not necessarily vital to the smooth functioning of the EU. The translation of all documents intended for the public, carried out by the EU institutions into all official languages, represents in this case an example of expenses that can be reduced without dramatically affecting the smooth running of things. I believe that information should rather be disseminated by making full use of existing means, so that it reaches the citizens who wish to participate in the European decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="de">I fully support this resolution. I am also convinced that our citizens must be allowed to participate in the framing of EU legislation. The Commission holds consultations to obtain the views of interest groups and EU citizens about planned legislation. However, such consultations are often only accessible in English. For example, small businesses or voluntary institutions have neither the time nor the financial resources to engage translators. I believe nonetheless that it is important for them to understand the Commission’s surveys and to be able to give their response in their own language. Until now it has been possible to make all submissions in any of the 23 official languages. The fact is, however, that if I find it difficult or impossible to understand what is being asked or proposed, then this is of little help to me. Of course the professional groups with representation in Brussels try to assist their clients. Nonetheless, this cannot replace the direct contact with the public that is urgently needed if laws are not to be framed in an ivory tower. Of course, publicising and explaining legislation and the processes behind it all come at a price. This is worth paying in the interest of better public participation.</p>

While political and economic decisions are increasingly being made at super-state level, this is clearly not the best way of bringing the people closer to decision-making hubs. However, it is also clear that there are basic measures aimed at addressing citizens’ essential right to information; in this case, information about EU documents. We have always been uncompromising in our defence of the principle of multilingualism in the EU institutions, and argued that everyone involved and those who wish to access information should be treated equally. It is clear that the principle of no language-based discrimination can only be guaranteed by safeguarding the technical and human resources for it and, therefore, by ensuring sufficient funding for interpretation and translation. Many of those now supporting this resolution did not advocate this safeguard during discussions on Parliament’s budget. This issue can never be seen in terms of the technical and administrative functioning of the EU institutions, but should rather be considered a fundamental political decision to ensure a modicum of formal equality between EU stakeholders and citizens.</p>

The fact is that the EU institutions cannot silence the abuses of the fundamental rights of Tibetans, who are seeing their freedoms and fundamental guarantees hampered. China cannot curtail Tibetan freedom, language and culture, and neither can it resort to building dams to annihilate a people and their ancient culture. A whole people is suffering, and they are willing to lay down their lives for the sake of their identity and freedom, as has happened with the self-immolation of monks. China must open Tibet’s borders so that it can be freely visited, in particular by UN observers. It must also take a seat at the negotiating table with the Dalai Lama.

The majority in Parliament implicitly continue to refer to Tibet as a territory occupied by China, when the powers instigating and supporting separatist movements in this autonomous region are undermining the territorial integrity of the People’s Republic of China. It is worth remembering that Tibet has been united, to varying degrees, with China since the 13th century, and that at the time of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, Tibet was ruled by a feudal regime in which the majority of the population consisted of serfs and slaves, based heavily on the land and subsistence farming.

      <p sl="it">In the Treaty on European Union, the Member States pledged to safeguard the principles of democracy and respect for human rights. Clearly all candidate countries must have satisfied these conditions before negotiations begin, but this does not imply indifference to conditions outside the EU. The last few years have been extremely dramatic for Tibet and the people of this nation have given a strong and succinct message: after 50 years of Chinese occupation, Tibetans are calling on the world for real change – a change that includes dialogue with the Chinese leadership, not an intensification of violence. The strategic partnership between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China should be based on common principles and values: the latter’s great economic dependence on exports ‘Made in China’ and the importance China attaches to its international reputation can influence such a change, if we make the effort. To guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, freedom of speech and association and the release of political prisoners, we need to take concrete action.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Respect for human rights, and freedom of identity, culture, religion and association are founding principles of the EU and of its foreign policy. Unfortunately, the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue has not resulted in any significant improvements in the human rights situation of the Tibetans. The managing authorities of the People’s Republic of China used disproportionate force while dealing with the protests of 2008 in Tibet and have, ever since, imposed restrictive security measures that curtail freedom of expression, association and belief. Torture, including beating, use of electroshock weapons, long-term solitary confinement, starvation and other similar measures are reportedly used to extract confessions in the prisons of Tibet by the authorities of the People’s Republic of China. I deplore the continuing crackdown by the Chinese authorities in Tibet’s monasteries and, in this context, it is essential for the Chinese Government to guarantee freedom of religion for the Tibetan people and all its citizens. The Strategic Partnership between the EU and the People’s Republic of China should be based on shared principles and values. In my opinion, it is reasonable to appoint a special representative of the EU for Tibet in order to advance respect for the human rights of the Tibetan people, including their right to preserve and develop their distinct identity and its religious, cultural and linguistic manifestations.</p>

However, since January 2010, the Government of the People’s Republic of China has been unwilling to continue the dialogue with the envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The Chinese authorities must engage in a meaningful discussion with the representatives of the Central Tibetan Administration on the future of Tibet and must also allow an independent international investigation to be conducted into the 2008 protests and their aftermath, and release political prisoners. The document condemns the Chinese authorities’ continued crackdown on Tibetan monasteries, and calls on the Chinese Government to guarantee freedom of religion both for the people of Tibet and for all of its citizens.

We must not lose hope or faith that their peaceful struggle will ultimately lead to an improvement of the situation. I am reminded of the African proverb, ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.’ Undoubtedly, it would be preferable if the tragic situation of the Tibetans could be changed quickly. Yet at the same time, the changes should be far-reaching. I am convinced that if the EU Member States showed more commitment to the Tibetan issue than they have done to date, the results would be more satisfactory. We have to believe that this is possible.

However, this is not the only problem in the region. China has instigated many measures that threaten the Tibetan language, culture, religion, heritage and environment. Last December, Tibet’s leaders asked the EU High Representative to send EU diplomats to Tibet to investigate the situation for themselves. China blocked these moves. In my opinion, the European External Action Service should adopt a bolder stance with regard to the matter, as this concerns the dire human rights situation of countless numbers of people. Tibetan leaders have even said that if nothing is done soon, not even China can prevent an Arab Spring-type situation from happening. The EU should also raise the matter with the UN Human Rights Council. I therefore voted in favour of the motion for a resolution.</p>

Such things should not be allowed to happen in this day and age. It is important that the strategic partnership between the EU and China should be based, among other things, on common principles and values. One possible measure would be that the EU should let it be known during discussions with China that it rejects the continued harsh treatment of Tibetan monasteries by the Chinese state authorities and should press the Chinese Government to guarantee the religious freedom of the people of Tibet and all of its citizens. Another step would be to ask the Chinese state authorities to lift all restrictions and to allow independent media, journalists and human rights observers unimpeded access and freedom of movement throughout Tibet. It would also be important to give the Tibet region autonomy. I have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, because it clearly supports the rights of Tibetans.</p>

However, a formal exchange of opinions on its own is not enough; therefore I agree entirely that one of the main tasks of the future EU Special Representative for Human Rights must be to ensure that the EU pays constant attention to the situation in Tibet and to inform the institutions of the situation. I also welcome the appointment of an EU coordinator on Tibet. China is not only one of the EU’s strategic partners, but is also a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and is accordingly obliged to develop the values contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, both globally and in internal policies. In order to become a modern power the authorities of Communist China must learn to deal with their internal fears and recognise Tibetans as equal Chinese citizens, whom the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China guarantees rights of autonomy. The culture and religion of Tibet that have been developing for thousands of years must be protected as a unique cultural heritage of humanity and its unhindered continuity must be guaranteed.</p>

The majority in Parliament implicitly continue to refer to Tibet as a territory occupied by China, when the powers instigating and supporting separatist movements in this autonomous region are undermining the territorial integrity of the People’s Republic of China. It is worth remembering that Tibet has been united, to varying degrees, with China since the 13th century, and that at the time of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, Tibet was ruled by a feudal regime in which the majority of the population consisted of serfs and slaves, based heavily on the land and subsistence farming. Moreover, in 1959 a separatist group led by the Dalai Lama launched an armed rebellion to defend this backward feudal serfdom. In the absence of objective or more current data, this resolution goes back to arguments that have been made in the past and makes new ones in order to continue with its confrontational and interfering approach to China’s domestic affairs, which is an affront to international law.

It calls on the Commission to look upon developing the digital single market as a priority, so that consumers have full access to more competitive offers of goods and services.

In spite of this, Europeans have not yet fully benefited from the potential of the single market in many areas and new incentives are therefore needed, in particular to ensure effective labour mobility across Europe, together with adequate social cohesion, and to facilitate selling and buying across borders. The single market is needed more than ever as a means to revitalise the European economy, by providing a concrete response to the current long-standing crisis, and to ensure the viability of the European project in the long term. Strengthening the single market and underpinning it with the right economic governance should be at the core of the European Union’s growth agenda.

I welcome the creation – as suggested by Mr Busuttil – of a body guided by an internal market prosecutor who can operate free from political pressure, tackling and resolving possible infringements. I also agree with the reference to the Internal Market Problem Solving Network (SOLVIT), a very useful tool which allows Member States to work together to resolve issues regarding misuse of internal market rules and I would argue that, for this, we must ensure a good level of financing by Member States in order for it to function as well as possible.

      <p sl="fr">Parliament has expressed its view on the implementation of the proposals contained in the Single Market Act. By way of a reminder, in April 2011, the Commission presented 50 actions to be carried out by 2014 to build a single market focused on the citizens. In line with the socialists’ amendments to the resolution, I condemn the tenor of the Commission’s recent legislative proposals and communications: a very liberal vision is revealed in the Commission’s proposals, which focus on facilitating business to the detriment of measures aimed at jobs and the citizens. I welcome the fact that Parliament has supported the priorities held by the socialists, such as the rejection of social dumping, the promotion of quality jobs, defence of the social protection model, the fight against tax evasion, but also an ambitious growth initiative based on the social market economy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, as it focuses on the real economy and the single market as driving forces for growth and jobs. In times of crisis, in particular, we need strong leadership, better implementation of legislation, increased transparency and fewer administrative obstacles. It is important that the Single Market Act’s 12 priority actions are implemented before the end of the year, and I welcome the fact that the Commission is to follow this Act with a Single Market Act II in the autumn. Most importantly, the Services Directive needs to be implemented correctly and we need to make use of the untapped potential for growth within e -commerce and the digital single market. I would also advocate greater flexibility with regard to the recognition of professional qualifications, and I am committed to simplified, flexible and clear rules for public procurement. I also welcome the fact that the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the retail trade and is following my report on a more efficient and fairer retail market with an action plan as early as this autumn (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2011-0307&amp;language=EN). I voted against a 28th regime of social security systems at European level, however.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Slightly over a year after the adoption of the Single Market Act, the European Union must implement an action programme aimed at improving the functioning of the internal market, along with measures to complete the liberalisation of services. The idea is to rebuild the foundations for growth on the basis of the smoother functioning of the single market. The European Union has much to gain if all of the opportunities of the single market are used effectively in the fields of energy, transport, retail, research and development, labour mobility and financial services. Correct, timely implementation of the existing legislation and measures, alongside the reduction of administrative burdens and useless laws, would boost economic growth. It is therefore a question of making what we already have work properly.</p>

It is also undeniable today that the single market is a driving force behind economic growth and employment in the European Union. Especially in this time of serious economic and financial crisis, the internal market is the best tool we have to restore growth to the EU’s economies; it should be put to use properly, effectively and decisively. It is essential to put the internal market at the service of Europe’s people and businesses, so as to boost the European economy, create jobs and improve competitiveness.</p>

To this end, we need a strategy that will lead to a stronger Europe with more solidarity, constructing not only a monetary and economic union, but also a banking union, as advocated by the President of the Commission. The existence of a single internal market underpins the creation of the European Union, and we must take the necessary steps to make it work better. It is not enough to say that the internal market is part of the EU; we must be able to harness its potential for growth. It is therefore imperative that the Member States be able to make use of the adopted Directives and transpose them into national law. Legislation that is not enforced is not only useless but harmful, as it deprives the citizens of their rights. I welcome the 12 measures for growth and employment presented here, along with all the efforts made to put the internal market at the service of Europe’s businesses and people. I also welcome the agreement reached on this matter, as it has enabled the tabling of a joint resolution by all of the political groups, for which I voted.</p>

As usual, it adds that the Member States should promote, develop and improve the application of single market legislation. It advocates that the Commission should swiftly and severely penalise Member States in breach of single market legislation. It then goes on to advocate an end to ‘protectionist economic attitudes in Member States’, the complete implementation of the Services Directive, the application of new legislation on public procurement, the implementation of the Single European Sky II and the privatisation of rail transport. That is, it calls for the doors to be opened to the colonisation of new and promising markets by big business in Europe, including and in particular, at present, the services sector. We agree on one point: that free competition in the single market is a cornerstone of this integration process. In the treaties and in practice, this sacrosanct principle outweighs any other, including social rights. We are therefore opposed to this process, and have, naturally, voted against this report.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The single market is one of the key drivers of economic growth and employment in the European Union. However, in many areas, Europeans have not yet fully benefited from its potential. For this reason among others, new incentives are needed, in particular to ensure effective labour mobility across Europe, together with adequate social cohesion, and to facilitate selling and buying across borders. The current economic downturn and the re-emergence of protectionist economic attitudes in Member States have threatened some of the most visible successes of the European integration process. At present, the Single Market is needed more than ever as a means to revitalise the European economy. The Single Market Act itself is the result of a broad inter-institutional and stakeholder consultation process. I think that the immediate priority should be the adoption of the 12 key actions of the Single Market Act, especially those which will facilitate completion of the digital single market, wherever possible, by the end of 2012. I believe that it is important to maintain the momentum achieved with the Single Market Act. It should be a rolling programme to be updated and reviewed annually, and it should also address the EU’s socio-economic problems and work towards a market that is at the service of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In order for us to be able to effectively boost EU economic growth by creating the necessary political and economic conditions, we must support the single market. This is necessary to ensure that the single market can develop appropriately and can meet the changing conditions and challenges of the global economy. The internal market currently comprises 27 Member States, and therefore paints a far more diverse picture than when it was created. It should therefore be transformed from a system of EU internal projects into an effective tool, allowing the EU to become more competitive compared to the rest of the world. This is the way to strengthen territorial, economic and social cohesion and implement the goals set out in the Lisbon strategy. In my opinion the European Commission and the Member States should draw up targets related to qualifications and increased employment for the future single market. Besides achieving a higher degree of independence and accountability for regions, programmes aimed at increasing professional qualification will thus be better able to adapt to the demands of both regional and local labour markets, enabling the regions themselves to deal with specific challenges more easily. The motion for a resolution incorporates these goals, and I therefore voted for it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">European citizens are at the heart of our institutions’ concerns. The completion of the single market should make their daily lives easier. It was with this objective in mind that Commissioner Barnier proposed the Single Market Act in 2010, which was complemented in 2011 with 12 levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence in Europe. On Wednesday 13 June, Commissioner Barnier presented the Commission’s intentions with regard to the Single Market Act to MEPs during a plenary sitting of the European Parliament. A second Single Market Act will be presented in September this year. Within the framework of the preparation of this new document, Parliament has made the following observations, which I fully support: cut administrative burdens and modernise our administrations, put the sectors which have a direct impact on the daily lives of citizens and consumers back at the centre of our actions, give priority to tackling youth unemployment and promote SMEs and their essential contribution to economic growth.</p>

The single market must not be seen in isolation from policy areas like health, social and consumer protection, labour law, the environment, sustainable development and external policies, as well as the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy. The current economic downturn in Member States has threatened some of the most visible achievements of the European integration process, which means that it is necessary to achieve the objectives originally set by the Services Directive, in the meantime avoiding damage to traditional economical sectors. The single market is needed more than ever as a means to revitalise the European economy, by providing a concrete response to the current long-standing crisis, and to ensure the viability of the European project. The Member States and the EU institutions should agree on a binding calendar, and on the concrete measures needed to enforce the single market legislation and to abolish all remaining unjustified obstacles to the free circulation of goods, services and workers. The Member States and the EU institutions should focus on adopting and swiftly implementing the key pieces of legislation on growth, giving priority to tackling youth unemployment and cutting red tape.</p>

The single market has given huge benefits to all Europeans and has opened up new growth possibilities for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises and enterprises from the small Member States. Therefore the consolidation of the single market facilitates not only economic growth, but also balanced development in Europe, and allows for a faster increase in the standard of living in those European countries that were still unfree even relatively recently. The current crisis and the instincts of protectionism that it spurs threaten the European project.

I am convinced that regulations supporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly significant in this regard. This sector plays a key role in the economic development of Europe, it accounts for 67% of total employment, and it has a significant impact on the growth of competitiveness and innovation. The incomplete implementation of the Small Business Act means, however, that these enterprises still face significant bureaucratic burdens, problems in accessing sources of finance and barriers to market entry. Yet it is worth underlining the progress made in the Member States’ implementation of relevant legislation, and the resulting gradual improvement in the situation.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to begin by congratulating you, Commissioner, on your strategy for improving the administration of the single market. In my opinion, this strategy, together with the Single Market Act and Mario Monti's strategy on the internal market, is the best thing to happen to the EU since the approval of the Single Europe Act in the 1980s. I am well known for my opposition to deeper political integration being prescribed from on high by European politicians. It is no secret that I prefer gradual and natural integration based on a voluntary deepening of economic ties, the removal of discriminatory legislation and bureaucratic obstacles, a broader spectrum in respect of the free movement of services, a digital market without borders, freedom to relocate company head offices and consistent enforcement of the application of European law underpinning the free market. All of this is based on the measures that you have presented to us, Commissioner. They may be an effective cure for some of the Union’s current ills. I would like, however, to ask one question: Why is it only now that the Commission has agreed to rigorous enforcement of the legislation? For example, Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market has been in force since 2009. We could have avoided many problems.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The single market is, undoubtedly, a main asset of our international competitiveness. The progress of the single market and further development of the regions are complementary and jointly create a powerful Europe characterised by cohesion and competitiveness. In this respect, I wish to highlight the particularly important role played by regional policy in the integration of the single market. I think that increased accessibility for every single region in the European Union is an absolute prerequisite for a dynamic and powerful single market. I would like to highlight above all the situation of the new Member States, where the level of accessibility is still low.

After all, there are 20 million enterprises throughout the EU, accounting for 175 million jobs and supplying 500 million consumers in the EU alone. I am voting against the motion for a resolution because, although economic growth is undoubtedly important in rescuing Europe from the economic doldrums, a confederation of allied European states as already largely set down in the Treaty of Maastricht would be quite sufficient for this.

I refer in particular to the hundreds of very small businesses – often run by families – working in the sector of seaside establishments who are still under threat due to implementation of the infamous ‘Services Directive’, which we alone have opposed ever since it was adopted.

      <p sl="pt">The single European market is immensely beneficial for EU citizens and allows the creation of new business opportunities, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essential for economic growth and the promotion of employment within Europe, and should not, therefore, be considered in isolation from other European policies. Now more than ever, the completion of the single market is necessary to stimulate the European economy and thus provide a concrete and adequate response to the current crisis. The Single Market Act is strategically important in this respect, since it is imperative, as Parliament states in this document, that the Commission make detailed and relevant proposals by spring 2013 on the 12 levers contained in the Act.</p>

The reason behind this is that we must avoid a situation where legislation adopted in the future impedes the functioning of the internal market.

We should remember that this is currently incomplete and that it complements the company law of the Member States. Its unfinished nature may dissuade companies from setting up shop in another Member State of the European Union or from carrying out their activities there, thus preventing them from taking full advantage of the internal market. We are therefore urging the Commission to continue its work on the 14th Company Law Directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats in order to facilitate mobility for companies in Europe. However, in this regard, I would stress that the national connecting factors should not be called into question. As regards the regulatory framework for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the European Private Company proposal must be concluded. This proposal, which forms part of the Small Business Act, could encourage the economic development of SMEs and, more broadly, of unlisted companies, by offering them a single statute and uniform organisation that is relatively independent of national legislation. The key will be to strike a balance between the flexibility of the model selected and its degree of harmonisation in order to guarantee its attractiveness whilst avoiding ‘law shopping’ between Member States.</p>

A plan of action is needed where there are clear and accessible rules, where the issues of simplification of bureaucracy are very evident, where company law is at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises, which today make up more than 90% of Europe’s companies. In this respect it is crucial to restore confidence in the Commission’s work to modernise the structure of company law while not losing sight of the continuing changes in global markets.</p>

In this resolution, we recall our commitment to social progress and decent work and we repeat our support for the European Youth Guarantee initiative.

Encouraging the recruitment of young people, supporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), promoting labour mobility and resolving the issue of the skills mismatch are practical policies that should be implemented quickly.

A European investment strategy should be launched, centred on infrastructure modernisation, human capital and laying the foundations for a sustainable economy. To finance this initiative, the Union must add additional resources to its budget: these exist and mechanisms must be found to make them available. It is therefore necessary to introduce a tax on financial transactions, to set up an EU-wide strategy to reduce fraud and tax evasion and to allow Eurobonds to be issued. Without these tools, the risk of an irreversible decline and marginalisation of Europe’s economy and policy on the world stage will become more and more real.</p>

The Commission presents the ‘social economy’ and ‘social companies’ replacing the public services that have been shut down as business opportunities. It also advocates setting wages according to ‘productivity’ as a way of putting even greater pressure on salaries and reducing their real value, which has been eroded by inflation.

It is now very clear that, in the European Union – and even more in the monetary union – our economies and our successes and failures are interconnected. Although the EU has a number of instruments for the coordination of economic policy, the crisis has shown that they were not fully exploited and that there are gaps in the current system of governance. The European Union has made efforts to adopt measures that would make it possible to overcome the crisis and to draw lessons from it for the future. The European economic recovery plan implemented in 2008 helped to mitigate the shocks caused by the economic downturn in our economies. Coordinated support was provided to the EU Member States that needed it, and measures were also put in place to protect the stability of the economic and monetary union. Now that the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy has been introduced, a number of initiatives have been proposed that aim to make accessible the EU’s potential in the area of enhancing growth and job creation.

Research, sustainable development and the service sector are just some of the niches where jobs can be created. However, it is clear that this will only work if the necessary resources are available.

The issues related to employment, social inclusion and combating poverty are increasing while divergences between Member States and regions are widening. Unemployment is particularly high among young people, partly due to mismatches between skills supply and demand but often also due to disregard for their level of education. Reaching a high level of employment is also necessary to implement fiscal consolidation and the recovery of the economy, both by maintaining the level of internal consumption and by making more people contribute to the financing of the welfare state. On their own, the commitments set out in Member States’ national reform programmes are often insufficient to meet most of the EU-level targets stipulated in the EU 2020 Strategy. The EU’s 2012 Annual Growth Survey calls for resolute action to step up job creation and economic recovery. The Member States must adopt or maintain growth-friendly policies, including the prioritisation of spending in the areas of education, life-long learning, research and innovation, despite the austerity measures necessitated by the economic crisis and the need to minimise the burden of public debt, especially in the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="en">This motion for a resolution relates to one of the biggest problems of our time, namely jobs, decent jobs which are decently paid. Like my political group, I voted in favour of the European pro-employment policy, which is to involve an investment pact to create growth and jobs. Tax solidarity is to serve as a social protection system, by reducing tax on labour income, and replacing tax on labour income with tax on capital and consumption. I also voted in favour of a labour market monitoring system on a European scale. The resolution is an expression of Parliament’s sensitivity to important matters concerning citizens’ livelihoods, and is intended to mobilise states, governments and the European Commission. I could not support the resolution as a whole, because fundamentally important amendments were not endorsed.</p>

      <p sl="en">My Conservative colleagues and I welcome the Commission’s communication on a job-rich recovery which seeks to complement the employment priorities of Member States. There are many points within this resolution that we agree with. We certainly welcome calls to support and promote entrepreneurship, business start-ups and the self employed. SMEs and micro-enterprises are the backbone of our economy and are a huge source of employment. We do not welcome attempts to use the Commission’s communication as an opportunity to call for greater harmonisation of EU employment legislation. We believe that a one-size-fits-all approach will prevent social inclusion, prevent poverty reduction and will impact hugely on our ability to deliver more jobs and does not adequately address the diversities that exist between Member States. We believe it is unrealistic to call for a stronger role for the EU by introducing new measures such as controls and sanctions. We do not support attempts to use the Commission’s communication as an opportunity to establish minimum wages. For these reasons we have voted against this resolution.</p>

We must stimulate the labour market through structural reforms. Economic and employment policies must focus on putting in place favourable conditions for the creation of jobs and boosting demand for labour. The Employment Package covers essential areas – such as youth employment and unemployment, education, training, skills development, retraining of workers, etc. – which require specific measures aimed at creating the conditions for a competitive European economy based on real performance and not on endless public borrowing. The priorities are therefore to facilitate entrepreneurship and to identify and overcome the obstacles facing potential entrepreneurs.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because we must not forget our first objective: the Europe 2020 strategy. We must support entrepreneurship, the creation of new companies and self-employment as tools that can create new jobs, particularly in view of the fact that in the Union small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and micro-enterprises provide over two thirds of private sector jobs. This is the path to take, even if it is an uphill one. I therefore welcome the labour market monitoring system and individual tracking scheme for countries that do not comply with country-specific recommendations. We very much hope for a ‘European Investment Pact’ from the Heads of State or Government, which could be an important element in shifting the one-sided fiscal austerity approach towards a more balanced one, and could represent a new impetus to push Europe out of the crisis. One example is the Energy Efficiency Directive, which could create 2 million jobs. Finally we cannot congratulate ourselves on the proposal to reduce the tax wedge on labour in a budgetary-neutral way because the tax wedge between what it costs for an employer to hire an employee and the worker’s real pay is often above 40% in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="et">I supported the motion for a resolution ‘Towards a job-rich recovery’, as I think it is important to devote attention to fulfilling the substance of the employment objectives set in the EU 2020 strategy for achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. In order to safeguard the sustainability of the European economy, the question of reducing the extremely high unemployment among young people is of key importance. To achieve this, our educational system must be brought into alignment with demand. I am glad that our group has contributed several motions to amend, such as motions to amend 2 and 4, which devote attention to combating youth unemployment and offer good recommendations on how to achieve this. The resolution effectively reflects the present direction of European Union policy – focusing on developing high-quality employment and implementing necessary austerity measures – while noting that the latter does not mean senseless cuts, but the trimming of senseless spending. Taking the above into consideration, I did not support the populist motions to amend made by the left-wingers, in particular motion to amend 12 about section 1, which does not support the implementation of austerity measures at all, and merely criticises existing efforts. The key to reviving the European economy is not black and white, as extremist political forces present it; rather, the issue must be tackled comprehensively, taking different parties into account.</p>

It is a tough challenge in the context of the current crisis but it is in line with the goals of the ‘Europe 2020’ strategy.

A European Investment Plan is needed, with a coherent industrial strategy that invests in public services, on the basis of new income sources and giving priority to investments that promote a sustainable economy, high-quality work and social justice. Job creation should be supplemented, from this point of view, by the regularisation of existing but undeclared jobs.</p>

At a time of great difficulties in terms of jobs, it is vital that the Member States provide guidance for the application of the Structural Funds to ensure swifter and more effective job creation, as Portugal has done with its Impulso Jovem programme, a strategic plan comprising initiatives for youth employability and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In view of this, I believe that it is vital to support SMEs in creating jobs, and also to assist social enterprises in their activities, to promote entrepreneurship and the various microfinance instruments, and to adjust skills to the real needs of the labour market. I also consider it important to encourage increased mobility within Europe, which will require mutual recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications, to facilitate the entry into the labour market of many highly qualified young people.

Austerity measures aimed at fiscal consolidation being pursued in a number of Member States have contributed to significant increases in unemployment, while the Commission forecasts predict a stagnation of the EU GDP in 2012 and recessions in several Member States. I believe that developing entrepreneurship and setting up businesses should be promoted as a means of creating more jobs. Therefore, we call on the Commission and the Member States to increase investment in these areas, in particular through public procurement and access to finance. We also call on the Commission to support the Member States in their fight against unemployment and especially youth unemployment, with unused allocations from the Structural Funds.

This is an exceptionally ambitious project considering the current situation in the field of public finances, since unemployment in the Union as a whole, instead of shrinking, has increased from 9.5% in 2010 to 10.2% in 2012. Currently we have 13% unemployment in Poland, and added to this constantly increasing inflation at a level of 4%. The targets that we have adopted are entirely appropriate. However, an analysis shows that our measures are not conducive to and sometimes actually block development.

We need only look at the countries viewed by the European Commission as leaders in economic growth, such as Poland. Despite positive economic indicators, unemployment in my country is over 14% and increasing annually. Imports of cheap products from the East, in particular China and India, increasing energy prices and the collapse of the European markets are key factors causing increased unemployment levels not only in Central and Eastern Europe, but throughout the Union. Unfortunately, flying in the face of expert analysis, European policy makers continue to go the way of economic perdition, pushing through ill-thought-out and unilateral reductions in CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases. Experts say that in Poland alone, the energy and climate package will mean that around 500 000 jobs are lost by 2050.

Estimates indicate that there are at least half a million women and girls with mutilated genitalia living in Europe. On the other hand, female genital mutilation constitutes abuse that violates the fundamental rights of the mutilated women, such as their right to the integrity of the person or the right to physical and mental health. Furthermore, since it is generally performed on girls under the age of 15, it also constitutes child abuse. The detrimental short- and long-term effects of the physical and psychological injury caused by the procedure are evident, not to mention that it can have a fatal outcome due to the lack of disinfection.

Any form of female genital mutilation is a harmful traditional practice that cannot be considered part of a religion, but is an act of violence against women and girls which constitutes a violation of their fundamental rights, particularly the right to personal security and integrity and physical and mental health, and of their sexual and reproductive health, while also constituting child abuse in the case of girls who are minors.

      <p sl="ro">It is important that the European Commission give female genital mutilation specific attention as part of its programme aimed at combating violence against women. At the same time, Member States must take firm action to fight this illegal practice. In this context, I think it is necessary to finance information and education programmes through which women themselves become aware that genital mutilation is not a traditional practice adding to the ethnical and historical specificity of their respective populations, but a form of violence against women. Many women in these regions believe it is an honour and a duty on their part to undergo without questioning such practices that are performed most of the time by women healers or midwives who are valued and looked upon with consideration within that group. At the same time, it is important to finance and organise educational programmes on equality between girls and boys, from the earliest age, in order to avoid gender-based society segregation and gender discrimination manifested in the form of these genital mutilations which are acts of violence against women.</p>

It is important that the EP stood united and strongly called for a end to FGM. Each year some three millions girls around the world are at risk from FGM, some 180.000 of them in Europe! These figures are scaring for such a barbaric tradition that causes irreparable physical and psychological damages to the girls, without any medical justification. Even if we must respect tradition and cultures, they should never be an excuse for committing violence against women and violating the universally recognised human rights. We need to give a strong message to the United Nations, Member States and the European Commission to do whatever they can to penalise people carrying out FGM and to stop this horrible violence against women.</p>

Parliament wants the perpetrators to be sanctioned. Each year, three million girls throughout the world are at risk of undergoing female genital mutilation, including 180 000 in Europe. These are unacceptable figures for a traditional practice which, I assure you, has nothing to do with religion. We are therefore calling on the United Nations General Assembly, which will meet shortly, to adopt a resolution with a view to ending female genital mutilation worldwide by harmonising the action taken throughout the world and issuing recommendations and guidelines.

In Europe, 500 000 women have been the victims of this horrendous practice, and 180 000 are at risk of being affected. This is one of the worst forms of abuse, violating women’s rights, which no culture or religion can possibly defend. This joint motion for a resolution on the need to eliminate female genital mutilation was tabled following a statement by the Vice-President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton, replacing motions for resolutions tabled by various political groups. For decades, this practice was tacitly accepted by some societies, but it is now vital to denounce and eliminate it. I therefore welcome the courage of many women, in particular those from Africa, who have played a role in this cause. These are harmful practices that violate the rights of women and children and jeopardise victims’ health. I voted for this motion for a resolution as it is imperative to put an end to this scourge, which degrades women and is a disgrace to society, and affects 3 million women worldwide, and I would urge the Commission to integrate the rights of women and children across the EU’s external policy.</p>

Protection of women’s rights has received a significant boost thanks to international instruments and commitments from the United Nations and the European Union. I think we are all in agreement that female genital mutilation is a serious form of abuse and torture of children and, I must specify, children from the age of just four. Today too many women are still subjected to these practices, which cause psychological trauma, indescribable physical suffering and repercussions on their health and which cannot be justified by tradition or as a symbol of identity.

As well as being in itself a violation of human rights, female genital mutilation causes very serious and irreparable injuries in the short and long term to the physical and mental health and rights of the women and girls who undergo it, constituting a grave assault on their person and integrity, and in some cases can even be fatal. I am of the opinion that it is essential to support members of civil society, in particular women’s organisations, working within their communities to end violence against women, including female genital mutilation.

      <p sl="en">I am horrorized about how many women are affected for genital mutilation every year all around the world and it is very worrying the amount of young europeans that have the risk of undergoing this procedure every year. Even though we say women, we refer to children when they suffer this injury, and therefore, they have no option to defense themselves. And is not only about a medical reason, is about the integrity, respect, security and physical and mental health of that women. Is the respect for human rights for that women. I will support all the initiatives that this Parliament is taking to stop this irreparabe and violent abuse.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, as I always support texts which promote steps towards greater equality between men and women. Combating violence against women is unfortunately a key part of this, and female genital mutilation is one of the daily horrors faced by thousands of women, mostly, but not exclusively, in Africa. Although, in theory, female genital mutilation is today legally banned in most countries of the world, the political will and specific actions to combat these practices are still often superficial. This violence against women, just like violence against children, and particularly girls, can only really be reduced through global policies, particularly cooperation policies aimed primarily at combating poverty and all of the inequalities with regard to access to education, health and social rights. In spite of its shortcomings, I cannot but endorse the principles of this report and that is why I voted for this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Female genital mutilation has been documented in certain parts of Africa, Asia and Middle East, and it is now being encountered in Europe as well. Most often, girls and women are taken to their countries of origin during school holidays to be mutilated. The European Parliament estimates 500,000 girls and women living in Europe are suffering with the lifelong consequences of female genital mutilation. FGM constitutes a persecution qualifying for being granted refugee status according to the international human rights standards as well as European law. However, because of lack of uniform implementation among all member states of the European Union, women and girls are put at risk of being returned to countries where they could be subjected to FGM.</p>

      <p sl="it">Thousands of women have received prosthetic implants the contents of which are not suitable for medical use and could be damaging. These women have entrusted their health (and their money) to the company, unaware that industrial silicon had fraudulently been put into the implants. On 3 June 2012 the French agency responsible for medical equipment published data on the statements of problems in women with PIP breast implants (around 30 000 in France). The figures are as follows: - rupture of implants: 2 252, - inflammatory reaction: 1 380 women, - removals: 7 868, of which 5 257 were for preventative reasons. In Italy, from the data supplied by the Ministry for Health, 121 recovery and care units and 48 outpatient units said they had used PIP implants out of a total of 3 911 implant procedures. That an incident like this could occur is a very serious matter. We are talking about the health of our citizens. It must be an absolute priority. We need to subject materials used in medicine to stricter controls, improve quality and safety and restore patient confidence.

      <p sl="fr">The defective PIP breast implants scandal which broke in December 2011 revealed the lack of cooperation between Member States and the malfunction in the tracking system for medical devices. More than 400 000 breast implants from the French company PIP have been sold worldwide despite the fact that they did not comply with quality criteria. The EU must react and learn from this. A review of the legislation on medical devices is needed. Measures aimed at preventing another health scandal must be taken as quickly as possible. I should therefore like to welcome the adoption of this resolution, which calls explicitly for greater controls and market surveillance for medical devices, as well as greater information sharing between the competent national authorities in order to ensure a better level of protection for patients’ safety. We are also calling for the implementation of a number of concrete provisions such as pre-market authorisation for the most high-risk medical devices, a breast implant register and an implant recipient’s passport – measures which the Commission should now put into action.</p>

There is still a lack of both clinical and epidemiological data on the potential risks of PIP breast implants. For third-generation implants there is a rate of rupture within ten years of implantation of 10-15%. The desire to provide swift access to new medical devices for patients must never take precedence over the need to ensure patient safety.

      <p sl="pt">The PIP-breast implants scandal has brought to light the failure of the EU’s current system of certification of medical devices. Breast implants are classified as active implantable medical devices. In order for these to be placed on the market, in accordance with Directive 2007/47/EC, they have to fulfil three cumulative requirements: they must meet the requirements set by the legislation in force, they must bear the CE marking, and they must be subject to a compliance assessment by a health authority. The CE marking is therefore a prerequisite for placing medical devices on the market, and is also a guarantee of compliance with the applicable legislation, demonstrating that the medical device is safe and fit for purpose. It turns out that this whole process failed in the case of PIP breast implants and may have failed in many others, jeopardising the health of European citizens. It is therefore essential that the next review of the Medical Devices Directive establish a common procedure which first and foremost ensures the safety of medical devices and the absence of risks to the lives and health of patients.</p>

I firmly believe that patients need to know that implants are not permanent and may need to be replaced or removed. Patients also need to be informed about the quality of implants and the potential risks associated with them. Despite this, however, the transposition of EU legislation on medical devices into national legislation has not prevented this health fraud, which has had, and will continue to have, a serious negative impact on health worldwide.

Raising awareness is also a key element: patients and potential patients need to be informed about the potential risks of cosmetic surgery and that implants are not permanent and eventually they need to be replaced or removed. Furthermore, a better regulation of advertising cosmetic surgery needs to be considered in order to ensure that patients are fully aware of the risks and there is a need for an EU-wide registration for breast implants, so that the endeavour to provide quick access to medical devices and the consequent will to increase profits would not overwrite patient safety.</p>

It is therefore essential that the next review of the Medical Devices Directive establish a common procedure which first and foremost ensures the safety of medical devices and the absence of risk to the lives and health of patients.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is regrettable that there is no clinical or epidemiological data available about the potential risks of PIP breast implants. In addition, random checks on PIP silicone implants have shown that the outer membrane manufactured by PIP has weaknesses that do not occur in other commercially available implants. This is dangerous for women because many PIP implants are made from non-medical grade silicone that contains constituents that attack the outer membrane of the implant and then enter the body’s tissue cells. Some Member States have advised women who have had such implants inserted to consult with their surgeons or to have the PIP implants removed as a precautionary measure. For this reason, it is necessary to set down the immediate introduction and implementation of fundamental, targeted direct measures according to the current legal provisions for medical products. It would make sense to carry out thorough spot checks on medical products that represent the highest risk, so that such situations can be prevented. The Commission should require suitable toxicological assessment for all medical products, and should propose that all carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substances should be gradually removed from the market. It would be a good idea for the Member States to impose sanctions for noncompliance with the new laws. These are some of the reasons why I voted in favour of this motion.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on defective breast implants made by the French company PIP. Although the company ceased trading in 2010, there are thousands of patients with defective breast implants filled with industrial silicone in Europe and beyond. I would single out the following problem areas: the absence of an implant register, control mechanism malfunctions, insufficient information and market monitoring. I welcome the idea of introducing an implant recipient’s passport and a common independent register of implants in the EU Member States. Not only would this help to trace the recipient of an implant made by a certain manufacturer but it would speed up the exchange of information between Member States, particularly when faced with defective implants. This case of fraud, which has affected the health of many patients, has revealed problems with the functioning of legislation at national and EU level. There needs to be an emphasis on stronger application of sanctions and control at European level instead of just leaving the Member States to address the issue. A patient not only needs to be given guarantees of the implant’s safety, but sufficient information on quality, risk factors and information about possible implant replacement. For this reason there needs to be effective and good-willed cooperation between all links in the chain: manufacturers, medical bodies and patients. Due to market control and the monitoring of manufacturers I spoke in favour of coordinated action by inspectors in the Member States, the random checking of selected implants and the auditing of manufacturers. Checks must be carried out before implants enter the market or companies are given licences to trade – thus establishing a preventative system, which prevents a repeat of the case of the French company where the industrial silicone used in breast implants leaked into patents’ tissue.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The PIP breast implants scandal is a disgrace. Almost 90 000 women in the European Union fell victim to this scandal. Parliament had a duty to react and that is why I voted for this resolution on PIP breast implants, which expressly calls for strengthening the quality of controls by certification bodies and improving the traceability of breast implants in order to guarantee safe, regulated operations for women. We have, in Parliament, a duty to protect the interests of European citizens, and the health of those citizens must therefore undeniably be our priority. The health of our fellow citizens should no longer be endangered by a lack of medical controls, or put at the mercy of one man’s greed, a man who is now being accused of ‘aggravated fraud’ and ‘manslaughter’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although the PIP scandal was a clear case of fraudulent and criminal activity, it has highlighted a number of other practices with regards to the promotion and sale of implants which need to be addressed. There are serious concerns about advertising of breast implants for cosmetic surgery. Advertising typically does not inform the consumer properly, and many women are not even aware that implants need replacing every ten years or so which means many operations over the course of a woman's lifetime. The S&amp;D group was right to table an amendment calling for a ban on the advertising of breast implants for cosmetic purposes, and I regret that it was not adopted. In cases where the implants are needed following surgery, for example because of breast cancer, these adverts are not necessary. In all other cases, we should not be encouraging women to commit to a series of unnecessary operations over their lifetime for cosmetic purposes, with all the associated risk and cost.</p>

In light of what has been learnt, the need to inform patients that in some cases breast implants are not permanent and may need to be replaced or removed is highlighted. Therefore I support the call for pre-market assessment of certain categories of medical devices and the introduction of a passport for implant recipients specifying the special characteristics of the implant, its potential health risks and the post-operative follow-up care measures associated with the implant; the passport would have to be signed by the surgeon and the patient, and would be valid as a consent form for the operation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on defective silicone gel breast implants made by the French company PIP (Poly Implant Prothèse). The tests conducted by the French authorities on the physical integrity of a PIP silicone breast implant sample indicated weaknesses in PIP breast implant shell, not found in other implants available on the market. Due to the lack of EU-wide registration of breast implants, the total number of women who have received implants is unknown. However, on the basis of the data provided by the European Commission, it is estimated that around 400 000 PIP silicone breast implants have been sold worldwide. Most PIP silicone breast implants were sold in the United Kingdom (40 000), France (30 000), Spain (10 000), Germany (7 500) and Portugal (2 000). The case of PIP implants demonstrated the failure of the current certification system to comply with essential health and safety requirements, deficiencies in the inspections carried out by notified bodies, as well as the lack of surveillance of PIP implants by national competent authorities pursuant to the Medical Devices Directive (2007/47/EC). I recommend that the Medical Devices Directive be revised with a view to introducing the ability to detect and minimise the risk of fraud, focusing in particular on provisions regarding market surveillance, so as to avoid a repetition of the PIP case.</p>

The manufacturing by French company PIP of implants made from industrial silicone, a material which is strictly prohibited for use in medical products, has raised a number of concerns, particularly because several patients who have received these implants will have to undergo another operation. Fortunately, these aberrations are rare thanks to stricter health standards at both national and European level. However, they are primarily the result of fierce competition between certain medical operators looking to use the cheapest possible raw materials to the detriment of patients’ health and public health. The text adopted calls for the reinforcement of these standards and notably greater cooperation between Member States with regard to controls on medical devices, and the implementation of a system of pre-market authorisation for certain categories of products by the Commission.

The risk of a merger between certain Islamist groups and the Tuareg rebellion are concerning but should force us to understand the reasons behind them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The financial austerity policies that have been imposed in Africa for 30 years by international institutions, external interference and the exploitation of natural resources have led to impoverishment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Mali, the population has barely seen the positive social and economic effects that should have come about through gold production. Mali is the third largest producer of gold in Africa. The Malian mining code does not provide for any restriction on mining companies in terms of environmental and social responsibility. This weakness in the legislation makes Mali extremely attractive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now uranium is being coveted by a French company, which is drilling and working with absolutely no regard for the population and the environment, causing many inhabitants of the Faléa commune to protest. In Niger, France has been exploiting uranium for 40 years and the situation of the local population has not improved at all. On 25 April, the staff of the Imouraren site initiated a strike to protest against disastrous working conditions, claiming that they were working 12 hours a day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Niger, 60% of exports rely on uranium, and the country provides close to 40% of the stock for Areva, which plans to develop what will be the second largest uranium mine in the world. Niger is classed as one of the poorest countries in the world in terms of the human development index.</p>

The Libyan conflict and the Malian coup d'état – the latter undoubtedly being in part connected with the former – have only made things worse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All the same, this area is full of potential in terms of natural resources, but that only whets outside appetites, whether of certain states or of some big multinational companies, especially French ones. Even when that does not actually make things worse, these companies’ interests are, to say the least, far from those of the local populations, a number of them having means sometimes greater than those of the states themselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In March 2011, the EU set up a strategy for the Sahel that is supposed to focus around security and development issues. With regard to what has happened in Mali, we might question the relevance of the actions carried out. Some observers have even wondered whether this security policy aimed at supporting the official military forces has not, on the contrary, made things worse and, indirectly and in part, stoked rebellion in the north of the country. It would be worth exploring that issue further, but time does not allow me to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to recognise that the EU, and France in particular, are losing influence in the regions. Libya and Algeria, for very different but related reasons, no longer play the roles they have done for a long time. New players are on the scene, starting with China, but also the United States, the South American countries, not to mention the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, which are building more and more Salafist mosques, upsetting the type of Islam – albeit moderate – practised by the local populations. This area is a powder keg and the local populations, more especially women, are its first victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU strategy for this region really must be reviewed because, for the time being, it is solving neither the development nor the security problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Genuine decentralisation is gradually being established under European influence. Decentralised cooperation, local development, support for a cooperative economy as recommended by the International Labour Office (ILO) should be the major themes in this reform of the EU strategy if we want to prevent this region from totally falling into chaos and if we really want to help the Sahelian population.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the situation in the Sahel continues to be extremely grave. Humanitarian aid for 18 million people suffering from hunger is made difficult by the activities of terrorist groups, traffickers in women and the political situation with the Tuareg in Mali. This year’s three-fold increase in financial support from the EU was necessary, but I fear it is not enough. We must also help with educating people, so that they can focus on legal activities that strengthen economic stability and the necessary independence of the population of this region, and so that they have a chance to resist illegal activities. There is good news from the activities of regional organisations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Joint Staff Operations Committee (CEMOC), and it is therefore important for the European institutions and UN to help them and provide financial and organisational assistance both in their fight against terrorism, crime and drug trafficking, and in coping with drought, famine and poverty. I applaud the fact that UNICEF has this year saved 4 million children who would have died from hunger and infections, but infections are unfortunately continuing to spread despite the vaccinations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Sahel has indeed become Africa’s new powder keg. Armed rebellions, coups d’état, hostage taking, the influence of terrorist groups, drug and arms trafficking, waves of refugees, separatist movements – all these are destabilising factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Conflicts have amplified the food crisis caused by poor harvests in 2011, so that 17 to 18 million people are threatened by famine, while in Mali there is the risk of a permanent no man’s land on a territory twice as large as France’s.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The complexity and gravity of the situation require coordinated action, from creating a regional framework of cooperation against terrorism and discussing in the UN Security Council the issue of Sahel’s pacification to increased European involvement aimed at stimulating and supporting coherent policies against desertification, underdevelopment and border permeability. Above all, however, I believe a massive and urgent international effort is required in order to provide the population with food and end atrocities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have already heard from many quarters that the Sahel region is a particular source of problems in Africa. The people there are living in inhuman conditions, which is something that we cannot simply accept. We need to do something to prevent this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that the people there are caught in a spiralling trap: they are facing drought, preventing them from keeping animals, they are coping with waves of refugees, terrorist attacks and unstable governments – in other words they are encountering a security problem of unimaginable magnitude. A number of EU citizens have been affected, falling victim to attack. This is not our sole concern, however, as we are particularly concerned with the plight of the people living in such enormous difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to take action, particularly to protect women and girls, who are the victims of violence, and who are also denied education. This is truly a Herculean task for all policy areas in the EU, affecting development policy and security policy equally, as organised crime seems to be the most lucrative business in this area, as well as many other external policies. We need progress, which is why we have gathered today for this debate.</p>

This is something we should really consider, because I believe that when we talk about human rights violations here we sometimes feel quite helpless; because many policies are moving in this direction and are proving inadequate, the question is: what additional steps can be taken? I think we should now take up this idea and discuss it between the groups.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the problem of acute malnutrition in the Sahel countries has reached alarming levels, affecting at least one million children. The population affected by the political and food crisis lives in extreme poverty. In addition, the weakness of the administrative structures of the countries in this region of Africa is conducive to the development and flourishing of organised crime and terrorism, intensifying the security threat not only in this region of the world. In view of the relative proximity of the region, the European Union must be fully committed to stabilising its internal situation and to improving the level of security, which also affects our own security. I therefore fully support the Member States’ call for the mobilisation of all available resources to support the security and development of the Sahel countries and for cooperation in implementing these actions at an international level. As well as the acts of violence against the population by both by the authorities and terrorist groups which deserve condemnation, the cases of abductions of European citizens are particularly shocking. The proliferation of huge quantities of heavy arms in the Sahel region in connection with the Libyan conflict also requires a firm response from the international community.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, as a result of a long-term alternation of drought and floods, the inhabitants of the Sahara region find themselves living in extreme poverty from which there is no escape. The backwardness, poverty and hunger of the population in combination with a bad, corrupt public administration have created a breeding ground for crime, terrorism, and violence.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The return of Gaddafi’s mercenaries from Libya, who are returning to Niger, Mali, Chad and Mauritania with quantities of weapons, ammunition and military equipment, is destabilising the region and turning the civilian population into defenceless slaves of the criminal gangs controlling various areas. In spite of this complex and opaque situation in the region, we must seek a way of providing effective help to the region’s civilian population, in particular women and children, who are most affected by the consequences of this situation. Where possible, we should reinforce the distribution of basic food aid to the most vulnerable sections of the population using the legitimate structures of the public administration, even if it is often weak and corrupt. Together with food aid, however, we must also maintain and develop contacts with local communities and lead them to social and work habits and the type of community administration that will allow them to survive in their difficult conditions. Nevertheless, it must be the responsibility of the official governments to eliminate the terrorist gangs and seize illegal arms, and we should therefore support the activities of the Joint Staff Operations Committee, which comprises Algeria, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As our colleagues in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D Group) have said, there are 17 million people in a very precarious situation.

Then there is state fragility, which is not simply connected with the existence of armed conflicts but also, for example, with corruption. Then there are the terrorist networks that are very powerful in this region – and the case of Mali speaks volumes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is our response? We gave it in our Strategy for Security and Development in the Sahel. Then there is the notion of cooperating with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union to deal with the conflicts.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the deterioration of the security situation in the Sahel-Sahara region is exacerbating the disastrous living conditions and respect for the human rights of the populations of various countries that are already very poor, with women and children particularly affected. It cannot be denied that the Economic Community of West African States has performed extremely objectionably in this context, endorsing situations that have arisen as a result of coups d’état in Mali and Guinea Bissau.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The mission of the EU’s foreign, security and defence policy for the Sahel, which is being developed, is fully justified not only by the EU’s security interests, which are threatened by the interaction of organised crime networks and drugs, arms, natural resources and human trafficking, as well as, of course, terrorist networks, but above all because the EU must be responsible for exercising its duty to protect populations with which it has such strong links. Naturally, this must be done in conjunction with the United Nations and the African Union.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, even though the Sahel is a geographically remote region, it now represents a serious security threat for Europe, with the potential for further escalation. The deteriorating security situation in the region is assuming more long-term characteristics. In all of the three countries (Mauritania, Mali and Niger), there are weak central authorities that are incapable of controlling the vast desert area in the north. Tensions between governments and the nomadic Tuareg, widespread poverty and a lack of employment opportunities create a favourable environment for the free operation of the terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. I therefore support EU activities aimed at ensuring security in this region. In my view, the EU must play an active role in resolving the situation, and must immediately begin implementing the comprehensive strategy for this region</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, around 250 000 children under the age of five affected by severe acute malnutrition in the Sahel region have received food aid in the first four months of this year, as part of the response to the current food crisis. It is also predicted that at least a million children will need life-saving aid during 2012 and the number of centres specialising in this type of care has risen to 5 200 in the nine African States affected by the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">The peak in the number of people needing help will be reached in the next three months because the region is starting to face the driest and hardest season of the year. As well as the food crisis, other needs are mounting up in Mali, where the protracted armed conflict has forced 170 000 people to abandon their homes.</p>
      <p sl="it">This resolution reaffirms the urgent need for further funds together with more international action for those who are living in this insecure situation and in particular for children and women who are in conditions of extreme suffering in Sahel, threatened by dangerous illnesses such as cholera, or victims of violence as in Mali.

Unfortunately it is a desperate situation. Side by side with poverty you have the existence of organised crime and that dreadful outfit al-Qaeda also operating there.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a paradox, because without improving the situation regarding poverty it is difficult to improve the security situation; without improving the security situation it is difficult to deal adequately with poverty. Madam de Keyser asked the very pertinent question of what we can do about it, and she very sensibly said we should consult with reputable groups within the region and probably also the African Union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the EU’s current strategy with regard to the Sahel does not sufficiently highlight the connection between development and security. In my view, we should, for example, consider a civilian mission to Mali.</p>

Obviously, the Commission needs to continue with its excellent work and focus in particular on the food crisis, natural disasters, chronic poverty and the situation regarding refugees. It is good that the Commission has increased humanitarian assistance appropriations. The EU must particularly consider the situation of young people, who are some of the most likely victims of recruitment by terrorist and criminal networks.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Sahel region is facing a multilayered crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The takeover by rebel Tuareg and Islamist groups of the entire north of Mali has resulted in about 150 000 internally displaced persons and a further 160 000 refugees in neighbouring countries. A humanitarian emergency has been added to an already complex situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Sahel region already suffers from drought and chronic malnutrition. Over 17 million people are now affected, with 8 million people in need of emergency assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The region’s refugees and displaced persons are among the most vulnerable. Severe food and medical shortages could lead to many deaths, especially of women and children. The current lack of humanitarian access to the victims of the violence in northern Mali, because of insecurity and attacks on humanitarian workers, is of great concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">The risk of violence spilling over into neighbouring countries, some of which are fragile, is alarmingly high. Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu have recently experienced days of looting and chaos. There are reports of abductions and sexual violence by various armed groups. One of the groups, Ansar Dine, is allegedly arresting people suspected of robbery and looting, and imposing Sharia-based punishments.</p>
      <p sl="en">These human rights violations must end. Finding a political solution to the conflict in Mali and preventing the contagion of the entire Sahel region are high on our agenda. We are working closely with the United Nations and our other partners in the international community. At last week’s meeting in Abidjan of the support and follow-up group led by the African Union, the EU pressed hard for a speedy institutional transition in the south. We also discussed how best to restore the authority of the Malian state over the north.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights, security and development cannot be separated. Improving the security situation is integral to economic growth and the reduction of poverty in the Sahel region.</p>
      <p sl="en">In recognition of the security challenges faced by the state in the region, the EU is preparing to launch a civilian mission in the framework of the CSDP, to be deployed in Niger by the end of summer 2012, to strengthen the planning and coordination of local security forces’ capacities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Extension of the CSDP activities to other countries in the region, in particular Mauritania and Mali, is under consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is also why the High Representative and the Commission proposed already last year a new strategy for security and development in the Sahel, which was welcomed by the Council. The Sahel Strategy combines political and diplomatic action, development aid, security actions and projects aimed at preventing violent extremism.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now more than one year into the implementation of the strategy in the region. Many concrete actions have been taken. We are helping promote home-grown solutions to social, political and ethnic tensions, notably through employment creation for the marginalised groups. We work to assist the local communities, in particular those living in remote and isolated areas, by improving infrastructure and creating educational, economic and employment opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel, we are seeking to improve the capacities of Sahel states to provide social services and development to the local populations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Enhancing transparent and locally accountable governance is also an important part of the Sahel Strategy, which seeks to address the underlying political, economic, social and development challenges in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU development cooperation with Mali is still suspended, following the coup d’état in March this year. It will be resumed in line with progress towards the full restoration of constitutional order.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we continue to provide humanitarian aid to those in need, wherever it is safe to do so. ECHO has recently mobilised EUR 9 million to help internally displaced people and refugees. A total of EUR 288 million has been allocated to tackle the consequences of the food crisis in the Sahel.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Georgieva has demanded rapid progress to open the humanitarian space and allow supplies of food and medicines to reach those in need.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU will continue to work in close cooperation with the countries of the Sahel region, with civil society, and with regional and international bodies to promote human rights, security and development in an integrated and comprehensive approach. As soon as security conditions allow, we will resume the projects which have been suspended in the north of Mali.</p>

      <p sl="en">Every citizen has an inalienable right to be treated with dignity, to a life in accordance with principles of law and moral standards. We cannot remain indifferent to widespread violations of human rights and the deepening humanitarian and political crisis in Sahel countries. We need only cite the example of Mauritania, where slavery has been abolished three times already, and yet it is still a commonly encountered phenomenon. It is also alarming that the Moroccan authorities have for 30 years denied non-governmental organisations monitoring human rights entry into the territory of the Western Sahara, and made it difficult for residents to access water, education and basic information. Despite the presence of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, this mission is not competent to decide on issues regarding respect for human rights, which, in my opinion, is unacceptable</p>
      <p sl="en">For many months, we have also witnessed atrocities and a deteriorating situation for the inhabitants of the Sahel band, which causes continuous waves of migration, for example. This is due to the lack of political response to the activities of armed rebel gangs, mercenaries, ex-Gaddafi forces and al Qaeda terrorists in northern Mali, Niger and Chad. As Europeans, we should respond loudly and resolutely to these events. In the name of freedom and respect for human rights, we must unanimously condemn the escalation of violence.

It really is an absolutely unacceptable situation – we are dealing with a violation of universal humanitarian standards. I am convinced that the European Parliament should rise above political divisions and emphatically voice its concerns.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a fact that extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances have significantly declined since President Aquino took office in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the government’s ability to effectively combat widespread impunity of the perpetrators of such acts has yet to make progress. We are dismayed at the recently-discovered murder of Esmail Amil Enog, as well as those of the other witnesses in the Maguindanao case. We call on the Aquino Government to improve the witness protection programme and to further enhance national law enforcement and prosecution capacities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We recognise the reduction in the number of killings, but still, as many other colleagues have also pointed out, much more needs to be done to protect the defenders. We have to express our concern that the use of torture and the ill treatment of suspects in police custody continues to be widespread. We urge the Philippine authorities to increase their efforts to rigorously combat the violations of the 2009 National Anti-Terror Act. The victims of torture and ill treatment and the families of the disappeared should have access to a medical evaluation and be adequately compensated. We therefore reiterate our call for government action to stop all private and local funding of police and military auxiliaries and to disband paramilitary forces and local militias. We also urge the government to revoke Executive Order 546.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important to remember that all these situations are not new. We have been talking about this for years. We expected a new course of action from the new government. I should also like to say that until we see results, this topic will be a regular feature on our agenda in this House in the years to come.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, although over the past years political violence has decreased in the Philippines, the murders of four journalists and a witness of the Maguindanao massacre have alarmed us, so we are calling for further action to combat impunity for extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Aquino has expressed his commitment to human rights, good governance and the fight against corruption, and his administration has made commendable improvements. To keep up the progress I encourage him and the government of the Philippines to take measures to protect the people involved in ongoing investigations and trials, as well as journalists and human rights defenders.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, seventy-two private armies and a culture of impunity cannot be accepted. The use of the death penalty is a disaster for any country, but particularly so when the country in question is a democratic state. A campaign of murder by private armies, however, is something that we must fight with all the strength we can muster.</p>
      <p sl="de">We recognise the clear and tangible efforts of the Aquino Government which are beginning to show initial successes. These efforts need to be significantly strengthened, however, and, in particular, the witness protection programmes need to be intensified. Because many of the private armies unfortunately have links to the army and secret service due to corruption and criminality, witness protection is a key instrument for finally ridding the Philippines of abuses and for gradually returning the country to the rule of law. This is a potentially prosperous, beautiful country and an important partner of the European Union. For this reason, it is urgently necessary for the rule of law to be restored.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the Philippines continue to report cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and political assassinations of activists, especially those on the left, and of journalists.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While it is true that the number of these assassinations seems to be falling, Reporters Without Borders considers the Philippines to be one of the countries with the highest number of predators of press freedom in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Corruption continues to reign supreme and facilitates impunity, especially in the military. Admittedly, reforms have been announced, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court has been ratified and the trial of the perpetrators of the Maguindanao massacre – the worst massacre of journalists the world has ever seen, in which more than 30 journalists were killed – is under way. This is to be welcomed, but concrete results are, to say the least, slow in coming and the announced witness protection programme seems to be a sweet-sounding euphemism, as shown by the dreadful murder of Esmail Amin Enog, who was chopped up with a chainsaw. He was one of the main prosecution witnesses at the trial of the Ampatuan family, which was behind the Maguindanao massacre. He was the third witness to be murdered in this affair.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even so, funding for the EU-Philippines Justice Support Programme (EPJUST) has been raised from EUR 4 million to EUR 10 million. The aim of this programme is to improve criminal justice in order to put an end to extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President Aquino declared that human rights, good governance and the fight against corruption will be a priority.

We also welcome the ratification of the Rome Statute by the Philippines, but now these words need to translate into actions and results.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is plenty of reason for concern about impunity in the Philippines. Witnesses, as well as journalists, are being killed, and sadly the Philippines ranks as one of the most dangerous countries for the media. Urgent measures are needed to protect witnesses, judges, lawyers and prosecutors involved in investigating the sensitive trials. A clear message should be sent by ending impunity for extra-judicial killings, forced disappearances and torture by bringing those responsible to justice, including people with high-ranking military or government jobs or who are in the chain of command of paramilitary factions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I firmly believe that the cause of the dismal situation of continuing impunity in the Philippines is either the weakness of official state structures, or the interconnection of parts of these circles with the private armies operating in the country with the consent of the State. In either case, our partner in finding remedies for the passivity of official law enforcement authorities in the Philippines must be the state institutions. In the civilised world, it would be indefensible for a country’s administration to hand over the performance of security and law enforcement activities to private units whose activities it cannot manage or be officially accountable for before its own citizens or the world public. This game of hide and seek played by President Aquino is merely an arrogant alibi, and we must not accept it. We must therefore demand that the Philippines Government fulfil its human rights commitments and remind it of its full responsibility for unpunished murders in that country.</p>

The fact that only five people were tried and there were no convictions is also very worrying, and does not say much for the judicial system in the Philippines.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of that, it is not surprising that a year and a half after President Aquino took office there was a protest march. One of the banners in that protest march said ‘500 days since the massacre is time for Aquino to act’. There was much expected of him when he took over as President and, while there has been some improvement, it is not enough.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary in the Philippines are not functioning properly, as confirmed by the UN Human Rights Council in the conclusions it adopted in May. In addition, the level of violence against journalists and political activists has increased dramatically since the last review in 2008. The report by the UN Human Rights Council pays particular regard to the events in November 2009, when armed men from the Ampatuan clan affiliated with the local police prepared an ambush on citizens supporting the opposition candidate in the regional elections for provincial governor. As a result of this brutal incident, 57 people were murdered, with foreign journalists among the victims. Subsequent actions taken by the judiciary were deliberately delayed and consequently proved to be completely ineffective. Lack of efficiency goes hand in hand with a lack of transparency in the law enforcement system, casting serious doubts on its independence. Frequent unlawful killings and kidnappings still go unpunished. The Philippines must take all possible measures to protect security and guarantee law enforcement in its territory.</p>

Members of the Ampatuan clan responsible for this crime still hold many important posts in the province’s administration, and retain a private army with hundreds of armed security guards, who torture victims, bury them alive and mutilate their bodies. The Maguindanao tragedy and the failed investigation into it are a serious signal to the Philippines Government that by losing the remains of democracy the country may be thrown into chaos.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We strongly urge the country’s leadership to prohibit and swiftly disarm the numerous private armies and to immediately arrest all those suspected of committing the Maguindanao massacre.

This tragic event illustrates the extent to which the Manila Government is increasingly presiding over a criminal culture of intimidation, extra-judicial killings and widespread corruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Philippines currently ranks just above the notoriously corrupt and failed state of Somalia in terms of press freedom. I therefore urge President Benigno Aquino to respect his country’s commitment to the rule of law and to upholding fundamental human rights by, for instance, instigating a witness protection programme to protect witnesses, and also by fighting very strongly to eliminate all the forced disappearances and all the harassment of the political opposition in what is otherwise a beautiful country.</p>

The situation reached the attention of the international community once again when the body of Esmail Amil Enog was found a few months after he disappeared.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the issue of impunity, extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances are unfortunately long-term challenges in the Philippines that have been widely acknowledged. This is why, for the European Union, support for the reform of the justice sector and the fight against impunity in the area of extrajudicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances are key issues on the human rights agenda with the Philippines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only two weeks ago, the EU, through its Member States in the UN Human Rights Council, actively participated in the Second Universal Periodic Review of the Philippines. Extrajudicial killings, torture and the need for a functioning witness protection programme were among the main concerns raised in this second round of the peer-review process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that on that occasion the government of the Philippines presented its human rights agenda and notable progress since the last review in 2008. As the House will know, we have been encouraging the administration of President Aquino to speed up the process of prosecution of the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, including those responsible for the Maguindanao massacre, and to put in place a comprehensive and reliable set of measures to prevent these acts from reoccurring.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were many previous attempts to address this issue and the course now set by President Aquino is in the right direction. We all welcome the commitment and the progress made by the Aquino administration in addressing human rights, the culture of impunity and respect for the rule of law in the Philippines. The ratification of the Rome Statute and of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is an excellent step forward. I warmly welcome it.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is a need to achieve more progress. The serious lack of trust in public offices is an endemic historical and structural political problem. Therefore, we encourage President Aquino not only to address corruption and fraud committed by the previous administration but also to fight impunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">We were encouraged by the requests of the government of the Philippines for EU assistance. We responded with the Justice Support Programme (EPJUST) 2009-2011, which provided technical assistance for strengthening capacity, particularly in the investigative and judicial areas. Achievements of that EPJUST programme included a decrease in the number of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances – from around 300 cases in 2006 down to three in 2011 – increased quality in the investigations of murder and abduction cases that have been filed, and an increased number of cases filed at the prosecutor’s office.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me assure you that the EU remains active in cooperating with the Philippines on human rights issues and in particular in the justice sector to address impunity. We have recently approved a EUR 10 million programme that will build on the work carried out through EPJUST and focus on strengthening the criminal justice system.</p>

The murder of the third witness to the Maguindanao massacre was reported on 31 May 2012 and four journalists have been assassinated.

The Universal Periodic Review on the Philippines held on 29 May 2012 recommends that the Philippines end impunity for extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances as well as torture, and bring those responsible to justice. I call on the Philippine government to provide adequate protection to journalists and human rights defenders and intensify the fight against extrajudicial killings.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the political leaders of Iran have long had a problem respecting internationally recognised human rights. Ethnic minorities also pay a price for the country’s policy of radical Islam, exercised by the State. Our appeal to the Iranian authorities to respect the right of ethnic minorities to use their own language when communicating in private and in public, to allow minorities freedom of religion, and to end the discrimination and persecution of minorities and the application of the death penalty for converts from Islam, is very important. It is therefore important that, although the arrogant Iranian administration is not making any changes today, it knows that Europe is watching it and that the whole world is watching it, and that it will know that it will be held accountable for its arrogant minority policy in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the subject of this debate, namely the situation of ethnic minorities in Iran, is indeed worrying and serious. Still worse, it is deteriorating, along with an already very complicated political situation within the country, which is affecting even the majority – let us call them Persian Iranians – who are seeing their rights violated and despoiled, as in the case of the elections, where was tampering with the results.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately the situation is much worse for ethnic minorities. Uprisings involving ethnic minorities have resulted in large-scale arrests, and prisoners from ethnic minorities are treated worse than those from the majority group within the Iranian population. The justice system is completely distorted to the disadvantage of ethnic minorities. Women from ethnic minorities are treated even worse than women in general in Iran, and schools in ethnic-minority areas are of much lower quality than Iranian schools in general.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This situation is therefore extremely worrying. In addition to this, there is of course the continued, and indeed increased, use of the death penalty in Iran. People may be persecuted and executed for crimes of sexual orientation, including young people.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore call on the Iranian Government to put a clear stop to these practices and change the treatment meted out to ethnic minorities. However, to be honest, I would say that we do so with little hope that the Iranian Government will listen to us. It is also important that the Iranian Government think about what it is doing, and consider the bitter seeds that it is sowing with these practices. It is rending apart the ethnic, social and cultural fabric of Iran and sowing the seeds of its own future disaster, as the people of Iran will rise up. We can only hope that, at that time, the various ethnic minorities and the Iranian majority population will be able to unite and succeed in one day bringing down this government.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Persians only form half the Iranian population. The other half is made up of different ethnic groups.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In August 2010, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination addressed the exclusion of these minorities, of which there are many. All the same, I will run through them for you: mainly, there are the Arabs, the Azeris, the Turks, the Balochs, the Kurds and the Turkmen. Our resolution essentially deals with a small group of Arab Ahwazis, and this group therefore represents a tiny part of the huge problem of ethnic minorities in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The group concerned is called the ‘April 15 Youth Movement’ and dates from 2005. It holds demonstrations in April each year. In 2011, it seems that these demonstrations resulted in 15 deaths and a number of people being wounded. This had been reported on Facebook and Twitter. This year, another person died and several were wounded, and those mentioned in the resolution – mainly six Ahwazis – were imprisoned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should say: ‘were imprisoned and ought to be tried’. Information is very difficult to gather on these cases because it is circulating on social networks but, despite everything, I think that the fact of naming them in point 3 and of saying that they must have a fair trial is a very important step.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is safe to say that all Iranians are repressed and live in a culture of state-inflicted violence every day. This sad reality of the Islamic Republic must not be overshadowed by the negotiations on the nuclear issue, a new round of which starts early next week. In fact, for those who believe that change in Iran must and will come from the Iranian people themselves, human rights are a strategic issue and can never be traded in a zero-sum game in relation to the nuclear programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">This House highlights the situation of ethnic minorities specifically today. Minorities in Iran continue to be discriminated against and harassed. Peaceful demonstrators are imprisoned after trials which do not meet any international standards, and the treatment of prisoners in Iran is well known across the world for its harshness. Torture, rape and executions are common practices, which we continue to condemn on the basis of our belief in the universality of human rights. More importantly, however, we urge the Iranian authorities to stick to their own commitments, as stated in their constitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Non-Persian women face double discrimination, as members of marginalised communities and as women in Iran facing laws which specifically limit their rights. We urge the Iranian authorities to free all activists who are currently imprisoned for their peaceful advocacy of minority rights and to respect the right of ethnic minorities to use their languages, in private or public, and in particular to guarantee education in these languages in accordance with the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, two years have now passed since the Iranian primary school teacher, Farzad Kamangar, was murdered because he was a Kurd. A few months ago, Riaz Sobhani, a member of the Baha’i minority, was sentenced to four years in prison, because he has peacefully supported the Baha’i University in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Maryam Rostampour and Marzieh Amirizadeh, who converted to Christianity, were arrested in 2009. They were charged with apostasy and proselytising a false religion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although apostasy is not a crime under Iranian law, judges can interpret Islamic law fairly freely. This has even resulted in death sentences. The Iranian authorities frequently say that minorities in the country have full rights. In fact, there are three recognised minorities in Iran: the Jews, the Christians and the Zarathustrians, but, for example, Arabs, Kurds, Muslim minorities, Azeris, Baluchis, Sufis, and so on, are not mentioned. The three recognised minorities have five seats in a Parliament of 190 Members, and they may practise their religious rituals. The government needs to understand that multiculturalism is a source of wealth and should be cultivated.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, a few days ago the Iranian Kurds commemorated the second anniversary of the death of Farzad Kamanga, a young teacher aged 31, who was hanged after four years’ imprisonment and torture. His crime: being an enemy of God.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A few days ago, the trial also took place of six Arab Ahwazis. Ms De Keyser spoke about them. They were accused of being hostile to God. Their crime: defending the rights of the minority to which they belong and commemorating the murders that had taken place against this minority during earlier demonstrations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same goes for all the minorities in this country: Baha’is, Azeris, Balochs and all the others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not a good idea to belong to a cultural or religious minority in Iran. It is not a good idea to be a woman in Iran. It is not a good idea to live in Iran, where the number of executions seems to be gathering pace while also affecting an increasing number of juveniles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore increasing the number of resolutions. To what end? Doubtless to salve our conscience until the next time. We all know here that the Iranian authorities do not give a damn, if you will pardon the expression.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are, however, so many other matters that we could more usefully have spoken about, such as, for example, the sentencing in Turkey to 10 years in prison of Leyla Zana, and yet she had been awarded the Sakharov Prize.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is regrettable that Iran – a country with such ancient traditions, such a long history, such a fine culture and such a great and important country – is today ruled by those who do not respect fundamental rights, whose nuclear ambitions are a source of tension in the international community and who most importantly oppress their own citizens. There have been many instances of persecution in the country, for example of Christians, but also of national minorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It goes without saying that we should respond to these events, although there is not a great deal that we can do. The Iranian authorities are very resistant to any criticism, but that does not mean that we should stop criticising them. The European Parliament should send out a clear message that we do not agree to such actions and that we condemn them. We should also support measures by the Iranian opposition, which is very active in Europe, and whose activities have also been visible at the European Parliament, and this is the right way to put pressure on the Iranian authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Iran is often regarded monolithically as a Shiite entity. Iran is in fact a multi-ethnic state with a multi-religious regime. It has Christian minorities that are in relatively good standing, for example part of the Christian Armenian community. Others, such as Assyrian or Aramaic Christians, are subject to significant persecution. Non-Shia Muslims are suffering, particularly the Baha’i.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is our task to consider Iran in all its complexities and to ensure that the religious minorities there are protected and supported. Unlike one of the previous speakers, I certainly believe that it makes sense to take a regular interest in Iran. We have also always done this with the apparently monolithic Eastern Bloc. We now have a free Central and Eastern Europe. Equally, one day we shall have a free Iran of many ethnic groups and religious communities that live side-by-side in peace with the old Iranian tradition and who are our partners.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the violations of the rights of minorities in Iran come by no means as a surprise, as the devastating human rights situation in the country has been reported and debated in this Parliament a number of times.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are calling upon the authorities to eliminate all forms of discrimination and urging them to allow freedom of association and religion, while freeing all peaceful minority activists from prison. Unfortunately, we already know that our resolution will be disregarded, just as others have been for a number of years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, I would encourage the EU to engage in dialogue and cooperation with opposition groups in Iran and abroad, and help them in their work towards overthrowing the current fundamentalist regime. The change in Iran will probably come from within the country, but we should use the opportunity of empowering democratically-minded Iranians to speed up the process.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, violence and human rights violations have become the political raison d’être of the rulers of Iran. It is the country’s Christians, having suffered persecution for many years, who feel the full force of their hatred, and who on more than one occasion have died for their faith. It is not easy to be a Catholic in Iran, since the risk of death is ever present. The European Union has its roots in Christianity, and it therefore has an obligation to defend these people and should forcefully condemn the situation in Iran. The right to freedom of religion is one of the fundamental human rights. Events in Iran cannot be tolerated on any grounds, whether economic or political. I would therefore call on the Commission to take all possible measures to protect Christians in Iran.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s judicial system has sentenced 600 Iranian citizens to a total of 300 years of deprivation of their social rights. Representatives of minority religions in Iran have received sentences that amount to a total of 4 000 months in prison. In Iran those who seek to obtain data on minorities face many obstacles because this Islamic Republic does not allow activists and human rights defenders to collect information on violations of basic rights and also forbids the free flow of information.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, even taking account of these difficulties and obstacles it is possible to see some trends. In particular, the regime can be seen to be intensifying its pressure on religious minorities, particularly – and I want to stress particularly – on Christians – I do not know why we are afraid to say it or write it in our resolutions – and more generally on all forms of religion that depart from Shia Islam. Those who belong to religious minorities are seen as second-class citizens and sometimes considered outside the law.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, for many years now we have observed repeated violations of fundamental rights in Iran, as well as discrimination against minorities on the basis of their religious beliefs, ethnic origin or other social and economic grounds. This means that the country is violating the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Bill of Rights. Arrests of demonstrators calling for respect for civil liberties are particularly concerning. Iran is also one of the world’s leading users of the death penalty. There is therefore a constant threat hanging over the lives of many people who have not committed any crime by international standards. The Sunni and Kurdish minorities face a difficult situation since they are accused of spying and harming the state. They suffer harassment and live in constant terror of arrest and execution. The international community should raise the alarm about Iran’s failure to respect these rights, and encourage the Iranian authorities to amend the constitution and the legal code to ensure that the rights of minorities are protected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am not sure whether it is a good idea for Parliament to have twice postponed its delegation’s visit to Iran; we should probably keep up contact.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too think we must send a strong message to the Iranian authorities on the need to cancel at once the death sentence pronounced against certain members of the Ahwazi Arab minority, who stand the risk of being publicly executed at any time. Iran must respect the right of these people to a fair trial, legal assistance and having their families notified of their fate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also believe in the need for an imperative request to end torture in detention centres and conduct objective investigations of the abuses committed so far. Last but not least, we urge the Iranian authorities to abolish capital punishment and repeal the discriminatory rules aimed at ethnic and religious minorities, and I believe there is a need for greater cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the extremely difficult situation faced by minorities in Iran is closely linked to the lack of religious freedom in the country. The previous speakers have spoken in detail about instances where ethnic and religious minorities, in particular Christians, have been discriminated against and persecuted. On a personal level, however, I would like to emphasise that I find it particularly distressing to hear reports of the death penalty being enforced against individuals who have changed faith. These executions are a fundamental and brutal violation of the right to freedom of religion, and they should not happen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Véronique de Keyser was right when she said that Iran is not a mono-cultural society although it is obviously an Islamic Republic. I can say though that, as all the other speakers have said, it is very dangerous to be a member of an ethnic minority or a religious minority in Iran. I can support this motion, therefore, which promotes the universality of human rights in Iran and across all the ethnic minorities and religious groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">The number of groups, as speakers have said, are many – those that we know of that can be easily identified by size or religious identity. However, converts from certain religions to other religions also face, potentially, a very uncertain future and may be bigger than some of the ethnic minorities that we know about in Iran. So, like others in the room, I would like to see the broadest capture of ethnic minorities so that the communities like the Assyrian Christians and others can be added and included in our statement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as has been said, Iran is a mosaic of ethnicities, with ethnic minorities accounting for up to at least 40 % of the country’s population. The main ethno-linguistic minority groups are Azeris, Kurds, Balochs, Arabs, Turkmens, Pashtuns, Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians and Jews. They are largely located in the periphery and far from the power base, Tehran.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite constitutional guarantees of equality, persons belonging to minorities are subject to an array of discriminatory laws and practices. These include land and property confiscations, denial of state and para-statal employment, and restrictions on social, cultural, linguistic and religious freedoms resulting in human rights violations. Common practices include imprisonment for conscience, unfair trial of political prisoners, corporal punishment and use of the death penalty, as well as systematic restrictions on movement and denial of certain civil rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Very often, ethnic minorities in Iran do not get a fair share of the benefits of natural resources present in their region, for example the water of the Lake Urmia basin in the Azerbaijan provinces, or oil revenue in the Arab-populated province of Ahwaz.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has raised these concerns at the level of the United Nations and they are included in the General Assembly Resolution on Human Rights in Iran, adopted on 20 November 2011. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has also underlined discriminatory practices in that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU does not take a selective approach to this question. The EU acts on the basis of its principled position and it has a keen interest in the preservation and protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities across the world. Iran remains a case of grave concern. As in other countries, we are constantly monitoring all examples of repression and discrimination based on sex, thought, conscience, religious belief or ethnic identity. In recent Council conclusions, the EU has deplored the widespread repression of Iranian citizens, including persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have used, and are using, all the available tools to raise awareness and call on Iran to respect principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination. This is no different from the way we act in other cases. The Vice-President/High Representative personally, and the EU, have issued statements and declarations on ethnic and religious intolerance in Iran and have undertaken démarches on individual cases. For example, in June 2011, the EU carried out a démarche in Tehran on the death sentence on four Iranians of Kurdish origin. The EU is deeply concerned at the discrimination and massive oppression of the rights of religious minorities. Vice-President/High Representative Ashton has issued a large number of statements on the precarious situation of the Baha’i minority.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the EU remains open to discussing human rights issues with Iran, including the status of persons belonging to minorities, it has decided on targeted restrictive measures against individuals deemed to bear direct or indirect responsibility for repression. Some 78 individuals are now on the EU human rights sanctions list for violations in Iran.</p>
