      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0047/2009) by Mrs van den Burg on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards reduced rates of value added tax (COM(2008)0428 – C6-0299/2008 – 2008/0143(CNS)).</p>

      <p sl="nl">This report on reduced VAT rates has been on quite a journey. In actual fact, there is no report left, because the two other big groups, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, failed to show up to the vote on my report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, without any warning, voted against beforehand because they did not like the rejection or adoption of one amendment or another.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By doing so, they have put the support for this important Commission proposal at serious risk. I regret this deeply because it has created completely the wrong impression about the European Parliament's position. Fortunately, they have backtracked and have now indicated that the Commission’s proposal can count on their full support. We agreed that we would no longer bicker about these amendments during the plenary, but would instead accept Commissioner Kovács’ proposal with a resounding ‘yes’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, Mrs Lulling nevertheless laboured under the misapprehension that she had to retable her rejected amendments, even though this is not really consistent with the text of the legislative resolution or the procedure we are following. There is apparently here in this Parliament a variation on the Latin saying Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi , what is legitimate for Mrs Lulling, is not legitimate for an ordinary MEP. Without taking anything away from her divine status, I would urge you not to be distracted by this and to vote emphatically in favour of the legislative resolution during the roll-call vote at the end. This is what this is all about, after all. Together with the Commissioner, I count on your support and I assume that Mrs Lulling will realise that if she withholds her support from this resolution because things have not gone her way, she will be much worse off and will create the wrong impression that she is opposed to a reduced VAT rate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This Parliament, and I am very proud of this, has a long tradition of supporting proposals for applying a reduced VAT rate for labour-intensive services. What is more, this Parliament has taken it upon itself, on the initiative of one of my predecessors, Mr van Velzen, during the employment summit in Luxembourg in 1997, to launch the proposal to use this low VAT rate as an incentive for employment by making these services cheaper, increasing the volume, and also by bridging the gap between illegal and legal working. This employment target is, to my mind, very important again at this point in time. It is my firm belief that the experiment has proven its effect beyond any doubt.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The previous Commissioner, Mr Bolkestein, was less convinced and was, like a number of Member States, sceptical. He did not want to use employment as a target for tax policy. He took the view that tax policy was not intended for this purpose. Fortunately, the present Commissioner realises that this should be seen in a wider context, and I am delighted that he is now giving this experiment a structural dimension.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to add a brief comment about the current situation. In all honesty, I cannot imagine the Council, in the current situation, not giving its unanimous support to this proposal. After all, it is keen to do something about this tragic job situation and the recovery of the European economy. Tax measures, including a reduction in VAT, for example, in the building and renovation industry, in making homes and our cultural heritage more energy-efficient, and all kinds of other things, could give an incentive to the housing market, which is now very much at a stalemate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the risk of labouring the obvious, it is not the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE Group within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection that puts the stress on energy efficiency. This was already in the Commission proposal. It was deleted in Amendment 6 and re-introduced in Amendment 7. This can only create confusion. It is, however, clear that Parliament is very much in favour of energy efficiency. We therefore hope that the Council will embrace the proposal by Commissioner Kovács and that this important vote today does not degenerate into internal squabbling.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Kovács" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to thank the European Parliament for its quick handling of this proposal, in the light of the request by the European Council of last December in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan to settle the issue of reduced VAT rates in certain sectors by March 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) has adopted a draft resolution approving the Commission’s initiative, and I hope that the plenary will take the same supportive line.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the ECON Committee and the rapporteur, Ms van den Burg, for their support. Indeed, the quick adoption of this proposal is necessary in order to give certainty about the application of reduced rates to certain locally supplied, labour-intensive services that would otherwise have to disappear at the end of 2010. Moreover, it is important to ensure equal possibilities for all Member States in sectors such as housing and restaurants, because in these sectors Member States are currently not on an equal footing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current economic and financial crisis adds to the urgency of adopting and implementing this proposal. It is not the moment to destroy jobs, which would be the case if the reduced rates currently applied in 18 Member States for labour--intensive services were not made definitive. Moreover, it is important to make these reduced rates rapidly available to all Member States. By incentivising consumer spending in areas such as the housing sector, reduced rates can have positive effects on employment, in particular amongst the category of low-skilled workers, who are precisely those who risk being laid off first in the current crisis. In this context, I have already recommended to the Council to modify the proposed date of entry into force of the directive, in order to allow its application as quickly as possible after a positive decision is taken by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Council, the Czech Presidency is currently concentrating all its efforts on achieving a compromise concentrating on a limited number of sectors – labour-intensive, locally supplied services – to which reduced rates should be made available, as required by the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I have some comments on the amendments that have been tabled to this specific and limited proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Amendment 3: on the exclusion of alcoholic beverages from the restaurant services, the Commission respected the coherence of Community policies, in particular the need for coherence between VAT and excise duties, but also considering the global health policy of the EU. Contrary to some concerns, differentiating between food and non-alcoholic beverages, on the one hand, and alcoholic beverages, on the other hand, does not create a serious administrative burden for businesses. Indeed, currently, seven out of the 11 Member States applying reduced rates to restaurant services exclude alcoholic beverages without any difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Amendment 2: as for the proposed extension of the scope of reduced VAT rates to machinery used by farmers, I consider this to be unnecessary. This is because the VAT charged on equipment serving as input for the agricultural sector is not a cost to farmers because they have the right to deduct this VAT, like any other taxable person.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Amendments 1 and 4: concerning the amendments related to the addition of children’s clothes and footwear, I would like to remind you that the proposal under consideration is a restricted one dealing principally with locally supplied, labour-intensive services. Therefore, further extensions of the scope of the proposal should not be considered in this context. Furthermore, bearing in mind the attitude and concrete positions of some Member States, this extension would surely jeopardise the unanimous support, which we very much need, in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Amendment 5: the amendment relating to the addition of monuments and gravestones is not necessary, as a reduced rate for these supplies is already allowed by the current provisions when provided by funeral undertakings. Moreover, renovation, repair, maintenance of cultural heritage and historical monuments is also covered by the current Commission proposal which is under consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Amendment 7: I can assure you that the Commission is very keen to specifically address the question of the use of reduced rates in order to promote energy efficiency. This will be done in the framework of the ‘Green Tax Package’ currently under preparation and will be coming to the Council and Parliament in April.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I want to declare that the proposal would support housing, support the SMEs and save jobs, which is fully in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan. It is not an obligation but an option: Member States can decide whether or not to apply it, so it even extends their tax sovereignty.</p>

      <p sl="sv">This report demonstrates that taxation is a sensitive issue, and I respect that. At the same time, however, I think that we could have handled the matter better in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which was responsible for the report. We are now tabling the text for a resolution, which is a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is, of course, extremely important that the internal market is not disrupted by unreasonable and unfair competition. There are grounds for reiterating this at a time when State aid seems to be flowing in abundance.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the EU needs a more sensible view of how reduced VAT rates can be used to promote jobs and growth, particularly on the local market and for labour-intensive services. This is what the Commission’s proposal is all about. In other words, it is about more jobs, but it is also about tackling the black economy. Thus, we need reduced VAT on the likes of restaurant services, care services for young people, the sick, the disabled and the elderly, hairdressing services and new goods such as audio books, which are very important in my own country, CDs, child car seats and babies’ nappies, as well as domestic services such as renovation and repair work and cleaning.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we fully supported the Commission’s line and added Amendments 6 and 7 under Mr Harbour’s name. As an aside, I would like to say that it is not easy to understand how these texts and the voting procedure are handled in this Parliament. In the first of these amendments, we emphasise the importance of reducing the ‘black’ or ‘grey’ economy. In our other amendment, we aim to make it possible to lower the VAT rate on renovation and repair work in order to save energy. During these difficult economic times, different means need to be used to boost the economy and a reduced tax may be an important method of achieving this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, Mrs Lulling’s promotion of alcohol comes up once again. As usual, I will politely, but firmly, reject her call.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, today’s discussion – and the previous speakers have confirmed this – is taking place in very unusual circumstances, since we do not have a report for the plenary as would normally be the case. I want to make things quite clear: it was an ill-assorted majority that voted against the report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group voted against this report, although we fully support the principle of extending the application of a reduced rate of VAT even beyond what the European Commission is proposing. That is because all of our amendments have been rejected by the socialists and the liberals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We had made a great effort to compromise. We accepted all the socialist rapporteur’s proposals. She did not think it was worth making the slightest effort to accept any of our proposals. The regrettable, but at the same time inevitable, result of the vote should not, therefore, be surprising, Mrs van den Burg.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to offer you some friendly advice to change your attitude in future because as the Romans used to say, errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum ['to err is human, but to persist is diabolical].</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us, however, come back to the matter in hand. For the plenary my group decided to retable some amendments that came from the Members of the committee that is knowledgeable on the subject. These amendments are important, and it has been said very clearly, Mrs van den Burg, that no one can prevent a Member from proposing amendments to a document or to a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The most important of our amendments concerns applying reduced rates to alcoholic beverages in restaurants. It is not, Mr Schmidt, a way of encouraging alcoholism. That is ridiculous. If the Commission’s proposal were accepted, restaurant owners would have to apply two different rates of VAT. It is complicated and it is not justified. Long live red tape. Believe me, if you do not vote for Amendment 3, I know how to inform the whole of Europe’s catering sector – and it is large – that your position has prevented the application of a reduced VAT rate on all its services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I proposed that food and all drink should be taxed at the same reduced rate, if it is applied. To me this is just common sense and I think that we could all support this proposal. Why complicate matters? Why look for public health issues where there is no reason for there to be any?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, my group supports the extension of reduced VAT rates and we urge our governments to take this issue forward. Our fellow citizens already had high expectations in this matter at this time of economic crisis and the daily catalogue of bad news. This measure supporting the food industry is becoming increasingly necessary, Madam President. We want Europe to be recognised for its flexibility; that would indeed be a positive sign.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, the European Parliament recognises that your job is difficult. It is not easy here, but when you are in the Council, it is worse, because there you have to work with unanimity. I hope, therefore, that everyone here will behave responsibly and vote in a coherent way. If we think that the Commission’s proposal is good, then we must support it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Quibbling in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs led to certain amendments being singled out. The socialists, behaving responsibly, once again, decided not to table any amendments at all in plenary, because in these matters, if we want to move forward all we in the European Parliament have to do is to give our overwhelming support, as far as possible, to the Commission’s proposal, if we consider it a good one, as is the case here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have had many debates about VAT, about subsidiarity and about the need for tax harmonisation. VAT is the classic example of us all being on common ground. Let us make use of it. Renewing, on a temporary basis, this experiment with a reduced rate of VAT, when it aims at and contributes towards strengthening labour-intensive services – not necessarily the case for alcoholic drinks in restaurants – has shown us that this system works, so let us build on it. Let us put an end to legal uncertainty and harmonise the basis on which Member States can intervene. We will then have consistent goals, tax harmonisation where possible and encouragement for labour-intensive services. Who could say no to that today? Who could say no to using tax reductions as an incentive to consistently improving energy efficiency in our housing stock?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, taking into account what happened in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, taking into account the debate that I see taking place in the Council, I believe that we must support the Commission’s proposal very strongly – and I hope with the largest possible majority. At this stage of the debate, trying to do better could turn out worse and I think that our fellow citizens would not understand our remaining in a state of legal uncertainty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to consolidate this system that has been shown to work. That is what our rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, is proposing, and that, I hope, is what Parliament will vote for overwhelmingly later on. In this way, the Commissioner can take this strong message to the Council and obtain a final decision which will make it possible to consolidate this system.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since this is one of the last chances we will have for doing so, I should like, first of all, to thank Mr Kovács for the efforts, often disappointing, that he has made over a number of years here, in a situation where taxation is subject to the rule of unanimity, and thus subject to veto by the various Member States. His task has been very difficult and he may feel not much has been achieved. I hope with all my heart that his crowning achievement, this directive, will go through with solid support from Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The proof of the excellence of his work is that, when we wanted to improve on it in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we were unable to do so. Some people were pulling in one direction, others in another. Each side was convinced we could do better. We managed to put through some of the better amendments, or so we thought, and then when we voted on the whole text, we realised that it was not going to work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the end, the group’s coordinators reached the consensus that Mr Kovács had probably struck the right balance. Therefore, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, like the other two groups that have just spoken, will not be tabling any amendments. You have struck the right balance and it is an intelligent one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some countries, today, faced with the crisis, are reducing all their VAT rates. I am convinced that this is a mistake. Member States need financial resources and this is not the time to go deeper into deficit in that way, even if you are doing so to stimulate the economy by encouraging spending. Another reason is that trying to reduce prices by playing around with VAT leads to very high real rates at a time when the Central Bank is trying to lower them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are proposing another strategy and you are right: using VAT to make targeted reductions or targeted changes in relative prices. These are the right choices, according to two criteria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, subsidiarity. In other words, you are targeting immobile products: local services and construction. Your second criterion for targeting is labour-intensive services. As environmentalists, we would have liked you to target the green revolution specifically: the sectors that are necessary if we are to emerge from the current crisis, which is the result of the industrial, liberal and productivist model that has dominated the world for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would have liked you to extend the reduced VAT rates to all goods covered by the Kyoto Protocol. In practical terms, if we combine locally supplied with labour-intensive services, then this would mean that all the construction, all the insulation, and all the development of energy efficient buildings could be covered in the directive, and that is good enough for us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say straightaway that we shall obviously not be voting in favour of Mrs Lulling’s argument. Of course, it is diabolical to persist in error, but I think this saying could equally apply to Mrs Lulling herself. We could also talk about Mandeville and private vice for public virtue. We shall not encourage private vice through public vice and we will defend those countries that try to limit alcohol consumption.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Kovács, ladies and gentlemen, and especially Mrs van den Burg, it is regrettable that here in Parliament we are only able to agree on the Commission’s proposal and not on the actual report produced by Mrs van den Burg. We would have gladly given our support to this report in its original version and we congratulate the rapporteur. However, it has been rejected by the majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The decisive factor was the ‘no’ vote from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. After the defeat in the individual voting, the committee was not then prepared to adopt any report at all, and this we very much regret.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes down to it, we have a lot to gain from the Commission’s proposal for a directive. We particularly welcome the fact that the Commission gives a positive assessment of the results of the Copenhagen study that was commissioned by the Commission itself. The study proposes the retention, and even the extension, of reduced VAT rates on services and other activities. This will secure jobs, particularly in small- and micro-sized enterprises, and bring whole sectors out of the underground economy and transform them into a regulated economic activity. In the present crisis, this stabilisation is very important. It will secure, and hopefully create, jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we on the Left welcome the reduction in VAT rates as a matter of principle. It is well known that, being an indirect tax, VAT hits those dependent on their wages and low earners particularly hard. High and very high earners must bear a greater tax burden. In recent years, these high earners have had their burden reduced in an irresponsible manner in all European countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s proposal is intended to be a regulation of unlimited duration. This, too, is welcome. This will avoid the less than ideal situation of us having to extend the reduced tax rates every couple of years. It will create legal certainty for the service providers. As a German Member, I am particularly pleased that the German Federal Government has finally ceased its blocking of a permanent regulation. This is something positive for a change from the grand coalition in the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of the amendments tabled, we support those that are in favour of extending the reduced VAT rates. As regards the supply of alcoholic beverages, however, the existing regulations should remain in place. As we know, higher VAT rates in this area will primarily serve to protect public health. Member States should, therefore, be given a free hand in this regard, too. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it is hard to believe that we are sitting here today discussing minor changes to the rules on value added tax when EU countries are facing the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression. We continue to pretend that EU economies are not as badly contaminated by bad debt and slump as elsewhere, yet even in Germany output is falling at the staggering annualised rate of 8% and government finances everywhere are stretched to the limit as tax revenue falls and welfare spending rises, and as governments take over private debts and try vainly to stimulate growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">The worst case is probably Greece with its downgraded government debt still 94% of GDP and with an interest risk margin that is today creeping back to 3%. Greece is going to need bailing out – but by whom? Not by the Germans, they say. Even ardent supporters of the great EU project are now having to accept that if Greek debt is not underwritten, Greece may be forced out of the euro zone. Probably of even more serious concern is the huge exposure of several euro zone countries to defaulting debts of Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I almost feel sorry for the Commission. For years it has been trying to do as it was told, upholding the rules on state aid, competition and procurement: rules which are essential components of the project but are now being ignored all round. The saddest spectacle is Commissioner Almunia’s statement this week that he intends to invoke an excessive deficit procedure against Spain, France and Ireland because they have broken the budget rules of the Stability Pact. Mr Almunia – please – the Stability Pact is broken. It never did have any teeth. Never mind that prudent government finances are essential to the survival of the euro, there is nothing else that these countries can do about their budgets.</p>
      <p sl="de">No doubt the gestures towards European Union will continue, but democratically-elected governments have a primary interest in looking after the populations that elected them. France and Germany have made it clear that their fiscal stimuli are there to help their own industries and workers. Obviously coordination is only for the good times.</p>
      <p sl="de">Economies are in dire straits all over the world. Some of them will pull through. If some European Union economies return to prosperity, it will not be thanks to the European Union or to its rules on VAT.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I do not hold with the notion that our economic salvation lies in tiny value added tax cuts, which are something we have had in the United Kingdom with, frankly, only a marginal positive impact. However, I do accept that reducing the taxation burden is an instrument of economic stimulation. Thus, this proposal – very modest as it is – whereby cuts in VAT would be possible in some sectors, is welcome so far as it goes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would have much preferred it to have gone further, beyond the realms of tokenism. Extending it to embrace house renovations and repairs would be its greatest asset, because stimulation of the hard-pressed construction sector is very much required, and, to achieve optimum effect, that concession should not be restricted to energy efficiency measures only. Construction needs help right across the board, not just on a selective basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Making it possible for Member States to act in making these marginal cuts in VAT would only be half the battle because in many cases – my own country included – hard-pressed Chancellors of the Exchequer with diminishing revenue resources will perhaps be hesitant and will have to be persuaded to act. Even I would have to concede, though, that on VAT issues such as those covered by this report, they would at least not have the excuse of blaming Brussels if they failed to follow through on what is permitted under these proposals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to join the Chair of our committee in sympathising with Commissioner Kovács over the difficult situation he faces in trying to get tax issues through the machinery of the Community. He has to use maximum political tact in order to achieve unanimity.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I wholly support the subsidiarity principle and the sovereign right of Member States to set their own tax rates, I would suggest to Member States which have not as yet taken advantage of the facility for lower tax rates on labour-intensive, localised industries, to seriously consider doing so.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the country I know best, where we have waltzed into a 2.5% reduction in VAT across the board – with, as Mr Allister says, little or no obvious response or result economically – I would suggest that it would have been much more effective to have concentrated action in the particular areas of labour-intensive, localised industries and to have reduced the rate substantially from 17.5% down to the lower rate of 5%, or below. That would have been much more effective in getting people into work, and activity going again.</p>
      <p sl="en">Areas such as house renovations and extensions, energy-saving improvements, and perhaps gardening and landscaping work and, as Olle Schmidt said, care for the elderly and care for children, are the ones which would get people into work and probably increase the tax-take, because those people would be paying tax on their incomes as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a win-win situation to concentrate in those areas, and I urge all those Member States which have not yet taken advantage of this, including and especially my own country, to do so.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The interest in adopting this proposal for a directive essentially lies in how it can help to invigorate local economies and support social action. The application of a reduced rate of VAT will be very important in the housing sector, both in construction and in renovation, as it will allow Member States which adopt it to reduce the cost to the end user.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The provision of local services, particularly by small enterprises, may also benefit from this reduction in the VAT rate, thus securing and generating more and better jobs by encouraging the consumption of goods and services, and thus stimulating the economy itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Restaurant services, which are fundamental to the smooth functioning of local economies, and increased tourism may in this way gain a great deal at the local level from this reduction in the VAT rate. These services, ladies and gentlemen, should not circulate within the European internal market, which will help to reduce the reservations of certain Member States, already expressed within the Council. As a result, I cannot agree with extending this reduced rate to equipment, whatever the pretext.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The prudent way in which this proposal must be dealt with in the European Parliament should not give governments which have reservations about the European Commission’s proposal any pretext to use, in practice, the right of veto afforded to them on tax matters by European legislation. As a result, Parliament must prudently reject any amendments without any real purpose which will only hinder the adoption of the text. As has already been said in this House, not only is the very best the enemy of the good, but the person who wants it all may lose it all.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This proposal for a directive is important not only for strengthening local economies, but also to meet the repeatedly expressed ambitions of various Member States. Let us therefore support the Commission’s proposal, as presented. This was in fact the outcome of the vote, with my agreement, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the work of the rapporteurs and call for the adoption of this proposal in the exact terms in which it came from the Commission and in which it was adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The regulation of VAT reductions has long been an area demanding a systemic approach. If a VAT reduction is permitted, all countries should have the right to benefit from it, not just those which won that right, but this is an issue for the future. Right now we need to make urgent decisions in order to overcome the economic crisis. The Commission's proposal covers labour-intensive services and locally-based services for private end consumers, including restaurant services, which would not impede the proper functioning of the internal market. However, there are doubts as to whether the restaurant services mentioned are just of local significance, or whether they would encourage different conditions of competition in border regions and have an impact on tourism. My country Lithuania, battling with the economic crisis, abolished VAT reductions. The government based this decision on the National Audit Office's assessment that manufacturers benefit most from a reduction in VAT, but who benefits from an increase in VAT? Price growth, which is disproportionate to an increase in VAT, clearly shows who benefits. This same idea was mentioned in the European Parliament when debating the reduction of excise duty on fuel. Representatives of the European Commission maintained that this will not reduce oil prices. I am pleased that the Commission's proposal being debated is using a different evaluation of Copenhagen economics. Perhaps the Commission could explain to everyone the concept of VAT, its influence on business and the consumer and indicate what measures exist, and moreover, whether they exist at all, to protect the consumer from the producer, as such cases are characteristic of many countries. I agree that VAT reductions must be applied with the economic and social considerations that every citizen should be able to acquire the goods and services they need most and with the aim of strengthening and supporting locally-based services.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the EU is confronting the most serious economic challenge in its history. Firstly, the crisis demands a thorough analysis of the errors inherent in the economic strategy that has been applied to date. Secondly, we need recommendations for effective solutions for the future. In this regard, the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax and VAT system should be analysed. There is no doubt, however, that the tax system and the VAT rate should be drawn up in accordance with the principles of the freedom, independence and sovereignty of the Member States. Our answer to a unified tax system is a resounding ‘No’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The newly admitted Member States, which are often less developed and have a specific demographic structure, with large numbers of young people, require completely different tax policies to the old EU Member States. Wherever possible, therefore, the VAT rate in the newly accepted countries should be as low as possible. Meanwhile, as I myself have put forward, we need to pursue a reduction in VAT across the EU as a whole in the case of cultural goods, such as CDs. On the other hand, we also need to propose a tax on financial operations and speculation. What is happening today, as regards the capital transferred from the newly admitted Member States, is impossible to control and contradicts the fundamental ideological precepts of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="it">At last we have a proposal that will guarantee equal opportunities for all Member States and improve the working of the internal market as regards reduced VAT rates.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always taken a close interest in changes to VAT, whether for the purpose of harmonising rates among Member States, adjusting VAT to the economic climate, or taking account of temporary exemptions granted to new members of the European Union. Although we have taken an overall view, our approach has until now necessarily been characterised by a need for flexibility in applying reduced rates, either to take account of the specific nature of manufacturing sectors, or for economic and social reasons.</p>
      <p sl="it">The proposal in question is, however, aimed at extending the application of reduced VAT rates to a variety of services, including labour-intensive services, restaurants, locally-supplied services, construction and transfer of housing, and services provided for the disadvantaged.</p>
      <p sl="it">Far from seeking to harmonise VAT in all Member States, the directive in question, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, intends to ensure equal opportunities for all Member States, while allowing them to set their own reduced rates. As a consequence, consumers will be led to transfer certain activities carried out within the local or underground economy to the formal economy, thereby encouraging economic growth without distorting the operation of the internal market. It should, however, be remembered that the majority of the services in question can already benefit from a reduced rate, if only in a limited number of Member States and for a limited period.</p>
      <p sl="it">The debate remains open, though, on the application of reduced rates for environmental protection and energy saving, on which the Commission is to provide specific assessments, given the importance of these sectors to the EU economy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in adding my voice to the debate on the Commission’s proposal for reduced VAT rates, I would like to draw your attention to the implications of this proposal in terms of combating the impact of the current crisis. The Member States currently need effective instruments in order to protect jobs and prevent a recession. Reducing the VAT rate for labour-intensive services meets this objective. It lessens the burden placed upon SMEs, facilitates access to basic services and protects jobs. At the same time, it neither distorts competition on the internal market, as it supports businesses providing local services, nor does it pose a threat to state revenue, since the introduction of lower rates remains a voluntary step. This Parliament should support the Commission’s proposal and I wish Commissioner Kovács every success in convincing the entire Council to adopt it.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The European Commission’s proposal to permanently reduce VAT rates for locally provided services, including labour-intensive services is timely and aims to achieve rationalisation and simplification through necessary changes, fine-tuning, and creating the potential for the growth in jobs in sectors with low-skilled workforces while restricting activities in the grey economy, retaining jobs and ensuring equal treatment of the Member States including their economic operators.</p>
      <p sl="bg">One of the main arguments for reducing VAT is that it will provide more favourable distribution of income after consumption, by reducing the cost of the shopping basket of low-income households and increasing that of high-income households. The changes in the consumer structure also involve changes in the gross domestic product and productivity in the official sector, and the reduction of activity in the grey economy, such as services in the housing sector and other local services which are the subject of the present proposal by the European Commission. Of course, the potential net economic benefit of reducing VAT rates depends not just on the characteristics of the relevant sector, but also of the specific economic environment in the relevant Member States. For example, increasing the scope for reduced VAT rates in sectors with unskilled workforces presupposes an inflexible labour market, while in the food sector it presupposes significant differences in consumption between high and low-income households.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We should also bear in mind implementing VAT reductions will also reduce treasury revenue. As a proportion of the gross domestic product, this ranges from half to one-and-a-half percent of the GDP of the different Member States. Stable public finances during the current period of economic upheaval will allow the relevant governments to deal with the structural deficits in the current period. Even governments which do have room to manoeuvre will make use of options such as cutting VAT rates for labour-intensive services in order to achieve other aims of their economic policies. In view of the above facts and arguments, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe will support the Commission’s proposal to ensure there is sound support in the European Parliament for this important stage of the decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal to extend the application of reduced VAT to certain labour-intensive services, restaurants and the maintenance and construction of buildings represents a great opportunity to have a positive economic impact on the market and employment in the context of the current severe economic crisis. Competition will not be affected, rather this will be a chance to give a slight boost to production and to stimulate consumption, create new jobs and support businesses and families.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, it would be beneficial to extend the scope of reduced VAT rates still further, for example to cover ‘green services’ in order to encourage environmental policies. As far as the text we are to vote on is concerned, I particularly welcome the proposal to cut VAT on babies’ nappies and children’s services. This Parliament has asked the Commission and the Member States on several occasions to improve coordination between macroeconomic and social policies in order to redress the rise in new forms of poverty. Indeed, we must not forget that approximately 17% of European families are now living below the poverty line and one child in five is poor.</p>
      <p sl="it">So we await the Council’s response – I hope that it will be able to adopt this proposal as soon as possible and open a wider and more ambitious debate on promoting fiscal policies for families as well as businesses, and perhaps come to extend reduced VAT to all children’s goods.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, within the context of Europe’s Economic Recovery Plan, it is being recommended that the Member States should make a temporary reduction in VAT in order to stimulate consumption. In addition, the European Commission has prepared a proposal to extend Member States’ options for applying a reduced VAT rate. Wider application of a reduced VAT rate will not only foster economic recovery, but will also contribute to the creation of new jobs and reduce the black economy. The amendments to the directive provide for a significant extension of the opportunities for applying reduced VAT rates. This will apply to catering services, renovation and repair work for housing and places of worship, labour-intensive and locally-supplied services, children’s car seats, children’s nappies and so on. From the economic and environmental policy viewpoint, it is also important to apply a reduced VAT rate to energy-saving materials and services connected with energy saving and energy efficiency. I call upon the European Commission to speed up the consideration of this issue and to prepare proposals on these points as swiftly as possible. These are welcome changes and demonstrate the European Union’s readiness to react quickly to the economic crisis to the limits of its capabilities. I hope that the Council will also support these changes. It just remains to urge the Member States to use these new possibilities in the application of reduced VAT rates. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, allow me to start, before I address the topic of the debate, to comment on the indescribable and painful attack by the euro-sceptics behind me on the euro zone and the Greek economy; I refer merely to the statements by Mr Almunia and Mr Trichet, who have assured the House that there is no risk of cohesion in the euro zone, that our collective defences are not working and, as far as the Greek economy is concerned, may I inform Mr Whittaker that he needs to get used to the idea that we are still one of the few countries with positive growth and low unemployment, even in these very difficult times. The euro-sceptics are anti-Brussels, anti-Frankfurt, now they are starting to be anti-everything.</p>
      <p sl="el">Now back to report we are discussing today. I wish to say that we need to look at this issue from two perspectives: from the perspective of when the whole story started, when we were not yet in a time of crisis, and from the perspective of the situation we are in now, with the biggest economic crisis striking deep into the real economy of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">During the first stage, before the crisis, the idea was to focus on the few labour-intensive sectors, such as catering, because we had an impact here, mainly on high prices and the cost of living. Now, however, with the crisis affecting many – if not all – countries, there is also the idea that Parliament, as the mouthpiece of the political views of society, should also make an effort to look at issues which were not covered at the time, at the beginning, such as the issue of agricultural machinery, which my group has the facility to propose in Amendment 2.</p>
      <p sl="el">As far now as these contradictions which we see on the left wing of Parliament are concerned, where certain issues, such as the energy aspects of buildings, are a good idea, but others, such as agriculture or alcohol, are a bad idea, I think that the best judge is the citizen, not the politicians.</p>

This is not an issue for political grandstanding or, indeed, promoting pet projects. Thousands of low-skilled jobs are being lost every day in every Member State. Low VAT rates have been shown to encourage employment in services, assist SMEs, and, indeed, make the informal economy less attractive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our responsibility here today is to deliver a strong message to our Member State governments to get on with it.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the phenomenon dubbed the shadow economy is a very grave problem, impinging on every economy to a greater or lesser extent. It is primarily caused by excessive tax burdens imposed by the state, which encourage entrepreneurs to engage in undeclared business activities, bypassing the fiscal system. This results in enormous budgetary losses and an increase in unregistered employment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this context, the initiative for introducing a long-term reduction in VAT rates for labour-intensive services and locally-supplied services deserves particular support, as it provides businesses with an incentive to operate within the formal economy. Moreover, it will promote an increase in both productivity and employment. At the same time, however, potential adverse effects, such as the introduction of lower rates to promote free competition within the internal market, or a decrease in budgetary revenue, should be taken into account. Therefore, balanced and transparent measures are essential, since obtaining the trust of our entrepreneurs is a prerequisite for the project’s success.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to talk about value added tax from two points of view – social justice and competitiveness. From the point of view of social justice, value added tax is regressive, that is, people on lower incomes face a greater burden and therefore we then have to increase social subsidies. Perhaps we should do the opposite. From the point of view of competitiveness, Europe is a service economy. We can compete globally by using our services to attract tourists and, undoubtedly, it is important that those services are cheap. Compared with the USA, our sales tax, or value added tax, is much higher. Perhaps we should consider this perspective when talking about a more coordinated tax policy, although, clearly, all of this is a matter for Member States to decide.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am fully aware of the shortcomings of the Commission proposals: I know that they are modest and limited in scope. However, I am also aware of the reluctance of certain Member States vis-à-vis reduced VAT rates in general and the extension of reduced VAT rates in particular. This reluctance certainly sets limits on our ambitions, as we need unanimity in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Commission, there were two options. The first was to table an ambitious proposal, which is fully justified, and to run the risk that it might not be approved by the Council. In that case, 18 Member States that currently apply reduced VAT rates on locally supplied, labour-intensive services should return to the standard rate. An increase in VAT rates from 5-6% to 20-25% would certainly result in the bankruptcy of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises and in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs at a time of serious economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, the Commission has chosen the other option, which hopefully will receive unanimous support in the Council: saving jobs, giving support to the SMEs and boosting the building sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">As many speakers mentioned the issue of energy efficiency, I want to repeat what I already said in my introductory remarks: in April we will come forward with a proposal that will be focused on climate change and energy efficiency issues, a review of the Energy Taxation Directive, and the Green Tax Package proposing reduced VAT rates for green services that are aimed at increasing energy efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we are at last addressing here in this House the issue of broadening the scope of reductions in Member States’ VAT rates on a whole range of goods and services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text that the European Commission presented on 28 January 2009 proposed applying a reduced VAT rate to several categories of activity, particularly the catering industry.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The text on which we are voting today must send a strong signal to that effect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="en">For our fellow citizens, tax harmonisation constitutes a basic safeguard in the fight against economic inequalities and social dumping in Europe. I call on the Council to work towards this.</p>
      <p sl="en">For all that, it seems clear that measures related to derogations on normal VAT rates may in some cases, taking into account the particular economic and social circumstances of each Member State, be able to act as a lever on locally-supplied services, including labour-intensive services. I am also very pleased that this proposal for a directive allows the application of reduced VAT rates to some services linked to the construction sector as well as catering services.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wish to thank the Commission by emphasising the technical adaptations that we and the members of the Intergroup on Family and Protection of Childhood have always wanted, concerning the application of reduced VAT rates to essential products for children, in particular babies’ nappies which represent a very significant item in the budgets of young families. The same goes for some equipment for people with disabilities; these provisions are heading in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">The issue of taxation falls within the remit of the Member States. However, common frameworks should apply, guaranteeing that the law is both transparent and free from ambiguity, and that the market operates cohesively and smoothly. The inhabitants of my country are unable to comprehend why a zero VAT rate is applied to children’s items in Ireland and Great Britain and a rate of 3% applies in Luxembourg, while Poland is expected to increase its VAT rate from 7 to 22%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, when we are undergoing a painful economic crisis, it is essential to seek solutions which will promote increased productivity and a growth in employment. Harmonising VAT exemptions is thus highly recommended, in order to avoid any discrimination that might result from the implementation of this tax. Reducing VAT rates for labour-intensive services on local markets, including the catering sector, should be considered as a very positive step, particularly for SMEs and artisans. Naturally, the lower costs will also benefit consumers. Furthermore, the initiative should restrict the ‘informal economy’ and undeclared labour. I therefore support the simplified and clarified regulations of Directive 2006/112/EC, the VAT Directive, since their objective is to place the Member States on an equal footing. The current situation demonstrates that it would be worthwhile to conduct an objective debate on the rationale of applying the tax on goods and services in the form hitherto employed. There are countries, the USA for example, where other forms of indirect taxation are applied and which, generally speaking, lead to a more dynamic, flexible and efficient economy. I spoke of this some time ago.</p>

      <p sl="en">At a time when Europe is faced with a major economic crisis, adopting this report will make it possible to revitalise the services sector by asking Member States to accept a reduced rate of VAT of 5% on labour-intensive services and locally supplied services. This would affect the catering trade, home-care services and hairdressing salons.</p>
      <p sl="en">Exemptions from VAT need to be harmonised because there are currently 11 Member States that are entitled to derogations and apply reduced rates for the catering trade for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">A reduced VAT rate will benefit employment levels and will help in the struggle against the hidden economy as well as stimulating local demand.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my opinion, we should go further still and also consider a reduced rate for cultural products such as CDs or videos, as well as environmentally-friendly products such as green cars or energy efficient buildings. The reduced VAT rate for some sectors will help to boost SME activity, while encouraging the establishment of an economy that is more environmentally friendly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In July 2008, the European Commission adopted a proposal on applying reduced VAT rates after 2010.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The sectors targeted in particular by this measure are labour-intensive services and locally provided services for local consumers such as services linked to the housing sector and the renovation of residential heating systems, as well as services linked to personal care and the catering industry.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The proposal is also part of the Small Business Act initiative which aims to stimulate activity in the more than 23 million small- and medium-sized enterprises in the EU with a view to developing the economy and creating new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Today’s debate and vote on reduced VAT rates will send a clear signal to the Council along the lines stressed by the Intergroup on Family and Protection of Childhood over the years. Among the various amendments that I support, I would highlight those directly affecting children's goods. This is an important measure which supports families with children and allows them to reduce the unfair tax burdens to which they are subject. I welcome the Commission’s proposal to resolve, once and for all, the nonsense of the nappy debate and the issue of car seats for babies. However, it is also important, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has argued, for the reduced VAT rate to be applied to children’s footwear and clothing throughout the EU, and not just in the Member States which had this system in 1991. We call on the Council not to lag behind Parliament and to go as far as necessary in understanding the legitimate needs and aspirations of families. I hope that we are finally at the successful end of a long struggle and demand by civil society and Members of this House to defend the tax rights of families who should not be penalised because of the children they rear, support and educate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Levelling the playing field for all the Member States, and increasing transparency and cohesion within the borders of the EU, are matters of crucial importance, as reduced VAT rates will enable the internal market to function smoothly</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be possible for the Member States to apply a reduced VAT rate to locally-supplied services, for example. The application of the reduced rate should most certainly be left in the hands of the Member States, while the tax system should promote employment, increase productivity and curb the ‘informal economy’. It is equally essential to harmonise VAT exemptions, as this will help to ensure a balanced and uniform approach on the part of the Member States and avoid the adverse effects of applying those VAT rates.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A reduction in the VAT rates for locally supplied and labour-intensive services should have a positive impact, since it will reduce the level of undeclared labour, whilst also reducing its appeal and increasing demand within the formal economy. However, if the reduced rates are to avoid damaging the smooth functioning of the internal market, they should be applied with care.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The political objective to reducing the VAT rate is to reduce undeclared labour and potential administrative burdens.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are in a global crisis, but a global crisis that is hitting locally. The turmoil started across the Atlantic, but has affected our cities, towns and villages. Measures introduced to combat the crisis and to rehabilitate our damaged economies must not concentrate solely on the national and international but on the regional and local also.</p>
      <p sl="en">Extending reduced rates of VAT to locally supplied and labour-intensive services is a positive step in this direction. It is a pragmatic decision that has the potential to stimulate local economy and encourage local enterprise and industry without interfering with the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>

This is crucial as SMEs make up 99% of all European enterprises, but the sector is suffering in the current climate.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for years, the European Parliament has been arguing for the extension of the list of goods and services to which a reduced VAT rate may optionally be applied The call for a reduced VAT rate in the Member States for things including catering services, building renovations and small repairs, such as shoe repairs, has become ever more pronounced.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are three reasons for this. The European harmonisation of rules on VAT rates promotes transparency and the smooth functioning of the internal market, and works as an incentive in the fight against illegal work.

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-087" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Václav Klaus" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Czech Republic">
      <p sl="cs">I would like first of all to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in the European Parliament, which is one of the key institutions of the European Union. Although I have been here several times before I have never had the chance to address a plenary session. I therefore appreciate the chance to do so today. The elected representatives of 27 countries with their broad spectrum of political opinions and views constitute a unique audience, just as the European Union itself has been a unique and essentially revolutionary experiment for over half a century, attempting to improve decision making in Europe through transferring a significant part of the decision-making process from individual states to pan-European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I have travelled here to see you from Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, the historic heart of Czech statehood and an important place in the development of European ideas, European culture and European civilisation. I have come here as the representative of the Czech state, which in its various forms has always been part of European history, a country which has often played a direct and significant role in the making of European history and which wishes to continue doing so.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The last time a Czech president addressed you from this place was nine years ago. He was my predecessor in the role, Václav Havel, and it was four years before our accession to the EU. Some weeks ago, the Czech premier, Mirek Topolánek, also spoke here, this time as the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the EU. In his speech he focused on specific topics arising from the priorities of the Czech presidency and the problems currently confronting the countries of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This enables me to approach you with themes of a more general nature and to talk about things which, at first sight, are possibly not as dramatic as the solutions to today’s economic crisis, the Russia-Ukraine gas conflict or the situation in Gaza. In my opinion, however, they are of absolutely fundamental importance for the development of the European integration project.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In just under three months, the Czech Republic will commemorate the fifth anniversary of its accession to the EU and it will do so in a dignified manner. It will mark the anniversary as a country which, in contrast to some other new Member States, does not feel disappointed over the unfulfilled expectations of membership. There is nothing surprising about this and there is a rational explanation for it. Our expectations were realistic. We were well aware that we were joining a community created by and composed of people and not some sort of ideal construct developed without authentic human interests, ambitions, opinions and ideas. Interests and ideas are to be found at every step in the European Union and that is how it should be.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We saw our entry into the EU, on the one hand, as external confirmation of the fact that we had relatively quickly, over the course of almost fifteen years since the fall of communism, become a normal European country again. On the other hand, we considered – and we still do consider – the chance to participate actively in the European integration process as an opportunity to benefit from the advantages of an already highly integrated Europe while at the same time contributing our own ideas to the process. We assume our own share of responsibility for the development of the European Union and it is precisely with this in mind that we accede to our presidency of the Council of the European Union. I firmly believe that the first six weeks of our presidency have convincingly demonstrated our responsible approach.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to repeat out loud and very clearly here in this forum, and for the benefit of those of you that either did not know or did not want to know, my conviction that for us there was not and is not any alternative to EU membership and that there is no relevant political movement in our country that would be able or willing to undermine this position. We have therefore been taken aback recently by the repeated and growing attacks against the Czechs based on the completely unfounded assumption that we are looking for a different integration project than the one we joined six years ago. This is not the case.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The citizens of the Czech Republic take it for granted that European integration has a necessary and important mission, which broadly speaking they understand in the following way. It is firstly to remove barriers which are unnecessary and counterproductive to human freedom and prosperity, hindering the movement of persons, goods and services, ideas, political philosophies, world views, cultural plans and behavioural models, which, over the course of time, have formed between various European countries for many different reasons, and secondly to exercise joint care for public assets that are of significance to the entire continent or such projects as cannot be implemented effectively through just bilateral agreements between two or more neighbouring European countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The effort to implement these two aims – removing barriers and making rational choices over issues that should be resolved at European level – is not and never will be completed. The various barriers and obstacles still remain and there is definitely more decision making at the Brussels level than there ideally should be. There is certainly more of it than people in the various Member States want. You are surely well aware of this too, ladies and gentlemen. I would therefore like to ask in a rhetorical sense whether you are certain each time you vote that you are deciding on a matter that should be decided on in this house rather than closer to the citizens, in other words within the individual European states? Other potential impacts of European integration are also discussed in today’s politically correct rhetoric, but these tend to be of a secondary and irrelevant nature. They have more to do with the ambitions of professional politicians and the people connected with them than with the interests of ordinary Member State citizens.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I said earlier that for the Czechs there was and there continues to be no alternative to EU membership – and I am delighted to emphasise and underline this – but that is only half of what I would like to say. The other half comprises the completely logical assertion that a range of potential and legitimate alternatives exists in respect of the methods and forms of European integration, just as it has done throughout the past half century. History has no end point. To claim that the status quo, in other words the current institutional arrangements of the EU, is a dogma forever beyond criticism is an error which unfortunately continues to proliferate, even though it is in direct conflict both with rational thinking and with the entire historical development of over two thousand years of European civilisation. The assumption that an ‘ever closer Union’, in other words an ever deeper political integration of the Member States, represents the only possible and correct course of development for the European Union is a similar error, which is postulated a priori and is therefore similarly beyond criticism.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Neither the status quo nor the postulate of deeper integration bringing indisputable benefits can or should be regarded as sacrosanct by any European democrat. It is unacceptable for them to be enforced by persons regarding themselves as, to quote famous Czech writer Milan Kundera, the ‘keepers of the keys’ to European integration.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Moreover, it is obvious that the institutional arrangement of the EU does not constitute an end in itself but is a means to achieving real ends. These ends are nothing less than personal freedom and a set of economic arrangements that will bring prosperity. In other words, market economics.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Citizens of all Member States surely want these things but, over the course of the 20 years since the fall of communism, it has repeatedly been confirmed that they are wanted more and cared about more by those people who have experienced tyranny for a large part of the twentieth century and who have suffered the effects of a dysfunctional, centrally planned, state-run economy. Those people are quite legitimately more sensitive and more aware of manifestations or tendencies pointing to ends other than freedom and prosperity. And those people include the citizens of the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The current system for decision making in the EU differs from the historically tried and tested traditional form of parliamentary democracy. In a normal parliamentary system there is a group supporting the government and another supporting the opposition. However, unless I am mistaken, this is not the case in the European Parliament. Here only one alternative exists and those who dare consider other alternatives are labelled enemies of European integration. In my part of Europe, we lived until relatively recently under a political system where no alternatives were allowed and where no parliamentary opposition therefore existed. We learned through bitter experience that where there is no opposition, there is no freedom. This is why political alternatives must exist.</p>
      <p sl="cs">That is not all. The relationship between the citizens of the various Member States and their EU representatives is not the normal relationship between voters and the politicians representing them. There is more distance between EU citizens and their representatives than is the case within individual Member States, and not only in the geographical sense of the word. This is often referred to in various ways: the democratic deficit, the loss of democratic accountability, decision making by the un-elected but selected officials, the bureaucratisation of decision making and so on. The proposed changes to the status quo contained in the rejected European Constitution or the not-so-different Treaty of Lisbon would only exacerbate this defect.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Since there is no European demos, no European nation, this defect cannot be solved by strengthening the role of the European Parliament. This would only make the problem worse and would lead to Member State citizens feeling ever more alienated from EU institutions. The solution does not lie in trying to breathe new life into the current form of European integration, or in trying to suppress the role of Member States in the name of a new multi-cultural and multi-national European civil society. These are attempts that have failed in the past because they were not natural historical developments.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am afraid that attempts to speed up and deepen integration and to shift decision making affecting living standards of Member State citizens more and more to a European level may have repercussions endangering everything positive that has been achieved in Europe over the past half century. Therefore let us not underestimate the concerns felt by many Member State citizens that decisions affecting their lives will be taken elsewhere and without their involvement and that their ability to influence the decision-making process is very limited. The success of the EU to date is due among other things to the fact that the opinion and voice of every Member State had the same weight in voting and thus could not be ignored. Let us not allow a situation to come about in which Member State citizens live their lives with a resigned feeling that the EU project is not their own, that it is not developing as they would like and that they are obliged merely to resign themselves to it. We could very easily and very quickly find ourselves once again living under conditions we now habitually regard as a thing of the past.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This is also closely connected to the question of prosperity. It must be said openly that the current economic system of the EU involves constraints on the market and a constant strengthening of a centrally-controlled economy. Although history has given us ample evidence that this path leads nowhere, we are following it again. The level of restrictions on the spontaneity of market processes and the level of political regulation over the economy are constantly increasing. This development has recently been further reinforced by incorrect interpretations of the causes of the current financial and economic crisis, attributing it to the market rather than to the actual cause which was, on the contrary, political manipulation of the market. It is again necessary to remember the historical experience of my part of Europe and the lessons we have learned.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Many of you will certainly be familiar with the name of the 19th -century French economist, Frederic Bastiat and his famous Petition from the Manufacturers of Candles, which is still a well-known standard text to this day, illustrating the absurdity of political interference in the economy. On 14 November 2008, the European Commission approved a real petition from manufacturers of candles, not just a Bastiat-style fiction, and imposed a 66% tax on candles imported from China. I could not believe that a 160-year-old literary essay had become a reality, but that is precisely what happened. The inevitable consequence of introducing such measures on a broad scale is that Europe will fall behind economically and that economic growth will slow down or even grind to a halt. The only solution lies in the liberalisation and deregulation of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I say all this because I care about a democratic and prosperous future for Europe. I am trying to remind you of the fundamental principles upon which European civilisation has been built for centuries or millennia. Principles whose validity is timeless and universal and which should therefore still apply in today’s EU. I firmly believe that the citizens of the various Member States want freedom, democracy and economic prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The most important thing at this point is clearly to make sure that we do not equate the open discussion of these matters with an attack on the very idea of European integration. We have always believed that being allowed to discuss these serious questions, being heard, defending everyone’s right to put forward alternatives to the one correct opinion, no matter how much we may disagree with them, is precisely the kind of democracy that was denied us for four decades. We, who have involuntarily spent the greater part of our lives witnessing how the free exchange of ideas is a basic precondition for a healthy democracy, believe that this precondition will be honoured and respected in the future as well. This represents an opportunity and an irreplaceable way of making the EU freer, more democratic and more prosperous.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, it was your wish to address the European Parliament. We have gladly granted this wish. Mr President, in a Parliament of the past you would certainly not have been able to give that speech.</p>

Mr President, I agree with you when you say – I only wish to make a few comments, but I feel obliged to do so – : we are a human community. A human community is characterised by having advantages, strengths, disadvantages and weaknesses. Together, we must strengthen the strengths and eradicate the weaknesses. I also agree with you when you say that we need to ask whether each decision that we take could perhaps have been taken elsewhere. Yes, but our national capitals must also ask themselves whether many decisions should not be taken in our towns and communities rather than at national level.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Allow me to make one final comment relating to our Parliament’s understanding of itself: we thank you for your acknowledgement that this European Parliament is an important institution. If we were not so influential, we would not currently be the legislator in 75% of cases and we would not be a co-legislator in almost 100% of cases with regard to the Treaty of Lisbon, and then it would, in fact, be the case that decisions in Europe would be made by bureaucratic means. However, it is now the European Parliament that decides.</p>
      <a text="(Sustained applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Thank you, Mr President, for your visit.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I apologise for taking up everyone’s time and delaying lunch but I do it only once in 10 years so maybe you will not mind. In fact I am like the Member of the Finnish Parliament who rose to speak only once in all his years in the Finnish Parliament and what he said was: ‘could you close the window, please’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say a few words in relation to these three reports, which are all part of the same package, which includes the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Saryusz-Wolski. At the moment we are looking for solutions to the financial crisis. That was self-inflicted and we are saying this crisis must not be repeated, but what about the raison d’être of the European Union to prevent wars and human crises? They must not be repeated either, and they do not fall on us like the roof in the Parliament building in Strasbourg. They need not be repeated, but only on the condition that we work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remind you that peace is not the monopoly of this side of the House. Peace belongs to everybody. Peace-building is our common duty. It is a little bit like love. It is unconditional. We have to be idealistic in this life. We have to look far away, like when we run in a forest. You do not look at your feet when you run in a forest. You look far away and then you know where you are going and you automatically put your feet in the right place. That is what we have to do. We have to be brutally honest and remember why the EU was formed: it was to build peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">All I am saying now is that, if we are to respect the inheritance of Mr Monnet and our forefathers, we should belong to just one party and that party regarding peace-building is called the ‘“Yes I Can” Party’.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to refer this report back to committee under Rule 168(2). Both this democratically elected Parliament and the European Commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and developing countries, actions that are not strictly speaking poverty alleviation, such as exchange programmes between universities here and there.</p>
      <p sl="en">The budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation, but some Members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget while that is precisely what we seek to avoid with this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">We did not reach an agreement. If Amendment 1 is adopted, then this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world’s poorest people.

      <p sl="de">I ask therefore for the application for referral back to committee to be withdrawn. As regards the substance of the report there are no differences of opinion.

I did so, not because I do not want economic help to go to those who have suffered tragically in this crisis and assistance to be given to them for that reason – that is absolutely right – but simply because this resolution, like most resolutions on the Middle East, is defective. It is defective because it does not establish the rights and wrongs of the situation and, without that, the resolution cannot and should not be allowed to pass.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that we are where we are in Gaza because of the actions of the Hamas group, who have rained bombs and rockets on a sovereign state, which has the right – as has every sovereign state – to react and defend its own people. Until the responsibility for this crisis is made clear in resolutions of this Parliament, then the resolutions themselves cannot be effective.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is essential that adults take more responsibility for the conditions faced by children and the opportunities they have in life. I am thinking, for example, of armed conflicts in which children are embroiled, where they are often forcibly conscripted against their will, face mortal danger and hunger, and lack access to medical care.

We are notably looking for child development and child education, and not only female child education – if you teach the woman, you teach the family – but also primary education.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a simple flaw in our thinking on primary education: we always seem to think that the state has the solution. I urge all my colleagues in this House to look at the solutions that have been highlighted by the E. G. West Centre at the University of Newcastle, which looks at private education for the poor. Where the state has failed to provide education for poor children, parents themselves have come together, finance non-state education and, therefore, are also able to subsidise the non-working poor. I would urge everyone to look beyond the state for solutions to help the very poorest in our society.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I voted against the Kinnock report with a very heavy heart, because the problems the report identifies are very important. Tragedies are happening all over the world, but the basis of her report is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and we move on, we do more and more on the basis of a very flawed convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">This convention was always a compromise; it was always a mixed bag. On the one hand, it has many good things, but, on the other hand, it has some absolutely inappropriate parts. It was written in 1989, in an age before we knew about predators. For example, it has rights to full access to the mass media in all communication to children and vice versa.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we have based this whole report on a very flawed convention, which also places the state as the only arbitrator of the best interests of the child, as opposed to the family, which in fact sets the parents as the nurturers and the guardians but not as the determiners of rights. So I had to vote against it. It also includes abortion, which has no place in children’s rights.</p>

In the run-up to the Irish referendum, and then especially after it, we were told that the European Union was not really progressing towards a common foreign policy and that it certainly was not meddling in the field of abortion law, and yet here we have those two issues tied together in one report. Despite all the promises we made about listening to the people and tailoring our policy to suit their demands, we have carried on regardless.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a very neat illustration of that earlier this morning when we listened to the President of the Czech Republic. He made a speech that was in some ways almost platitudinous. He made the very banal and unarguable point that governments are better when there is an opposition and that we should tolerate other points of view. What was the reaction of this Chamber when he said that we should tolerate other points of view? People in the PSE and the PPE-DE Groups turned their backs and walked out. Not only will they not respond to alternative points of view, they cannot even bear to listen to them. What neater example could you have of this House’s attitude towards the electorates out there?

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the social economy plays a vital role in local and regional development. As set out in the Lisbon Strategy, it forms an integral part of a common employment policy. Statistical data has shown it to be an influential sector of the economy, creating new jobs within the EU and providing jobs for 11 million people, which represents almost 7% of the labour force. It is also worth emphasising the role played by the social economy in rural areas, promoting economic development by regenerating declining industrial zones and creating and sustaining new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We can therefore see that the social economy has become an indispensable part of ensuring stable and sustainable economic growth, by virtue of the crucial role it plays in solving new social problems. Its role has also been strengthened in traditional sectors, such as commerce, agriculture and industry.

However, now, in particular, every job created, every new improvement in the quality of social services has a specific value.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in reading through this report, I came across the definition of a social economy and I was interested to see what the definition was. It pointed out two things that struck me: one was social objectives over capital, and the other was the principles of solidarity and responsibility. Furthermore, it talked about democratic control by members. No mention was made of the willing and free exchange between buyer and seller in order to produce the profit which can then be reinvested to create jobs. What could be more social than making a profit to re-invest to create jobs for your population?</p>
      <p sl="en">When we start to focus on so-called social needs, rather than the need to create profit and the need to make sure that we can create jobs and spread wealth throughout an economy, we end up in the trap that Hayek, the great Austrian economist, – and also Ayn Rand – warned about at the beginning of the last century where we forget about profit and start on the slippery slope to serfdom.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am delighted that we continue to take mental health with some seriousness and some priority here in this House. It must remain high on the EU health policy agenda, as one in four people will experience a depressive illness at least once in their lives, and by 2020 it will be the most common illness in the developing world.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I am afraid that in Member States, including my own country, we have the theory; we talk the talk. Our mental health policy is articulated in a document called A Vision for Change and many of the calls for action in the rapporteur’s report are stated in our national policy or, indeed, are enshrined in our legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I am afraid the coalface delivery of mental health services continues to be completely unfit for purposes. There is a huge disconnection taking place between the theories and the reports, and we are always – particularly in my country – an action plan away from action.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, one in four people experience mental health problems at least once in their lives. Eight of the ten leading causes of disability are mental health issues, and mental health problems have a huge effect on those not directly affected. Therefore, we urgently need to update mental health legislation that can properly develop an awareness of the importance of good mental health.</p>
      <p sl="en">The message I have been trying to get across in my constituency in the West Midlands is that the media, the internet, schools and workplaces all have a vital role to play in making the public aware.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we also need more research into the field of mental health and the interaction between mental and physical health problems, and an explanation of how mental health initiatives might be funded under the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. This needs to be undertaken urgently.</p>
      <p sl="en">Employers also need to promote a healthy working climate, paying attention to work-related stress and the underlying causes of mental disorder at the workplace, and tackling those causes. I was therefore very pleased to support this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, 90% of suicides are the result of mental health problems. The number of people affected by depression and other civilisation-related diseases, caused by stress and the pace of life, is markedly increasing. The ageing of Europe’s population is linked to an increase in the number of people who fall victim to age-related diseases. Efforts to prevent and diagnose mental health problems, combat exclusion and stigmatisation, and provide support for sufferers and their families, are significant steps towards protecting the health of our society. I have therefore given Mrs Tzampazi’s report my heartfelt support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Another area where I have serious questions is the growing movement towards assessing all small children for mental health problems and medicating appropriately. Although this report fortunately does not go that far, there is a casual reference to the assessment of children. Many children, if you assess them as children, would not seem normal and yet they are developing well. The key question we must ask ourselves, in the face of growing mental health problems, is: why is it getting worse, particularly in the face of suicide? Are we not allowing human society to exist in a way that enables people to develop and live in a normal, healthy way? If mental health is getting worse, we have to give a lot of thought to the society we are creating.</p>

      <p sl="pl">1) there is a crisis and the EU, and other institutions, face serious problems which require their attention;</p>
      <p sl="pl">2) the cost of investigating the alleged flights, which was borne by the EU, amounted to millions of euros and exposed cases involving those who bestially murder, and have murdered, innocent people, including EU citizens, and it is our duty to protect our citizens and provide assistance to victims of terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The extremely emotional attitude towards the flights, the apparent creation of yet another, costly political scandal, had no added value and placed the burden of cost on European taxpayers.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when we look at applied research, I wonder whether we should be looking into the defects of the common fisheries policy. Let us not forget that for over 40 years we have had a common fisheries policy that was designed to run European commercial fishing on a sustainable basis, but has failed to deliver either environmental sustainability or development of the fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also contrast this with the property-rights-based approach of countries such as New Zealand, where the Government recognised that by giving people a vested interest in maintaining a resource they would fight to preserve it. We can also look at Iceland, where we have a successful market-oriented approach with individual tradeable quotas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we can apply new technology and new research with all the will in the world, but if we continue to have a system where, despite all the innovation, governments tell individual fishermen in detail how much they can fish, then all the applied research will be a complete waste of time. It is time to scrap the common fisheries policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in the current difficult economic climate, this report brings the kind of joined-up thinking that is desperately needed. VAT reductions will help most the people who need it most – the people who earn less than others. I believe this report is also about job creation, and that is why I supported it. It is about making sure that jobs do not disappear into the black economy. I hope that it will be implemented quickly, especially in my region, in the West Midlands.</p>

Providing people with an incentive to ‘buy green’ is exactly the kind of market-based instrument that will reap the greatest benefits. VAT reductions across the world are used to encourage people to buy energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly fridges, freezers and other goods that use up large amounts of energy, and cheaper prices for these products will help the less well-off.</p>

      <p sl="fr">By retabling our amendments aimed at a fairer application of a reduced VAT rate – especially, for example, on children’s clothes in the new Member States, so as to put them on the same footing as the older ones – we wanted to send a strong message to the Commission and the Council.</p>

It has to be a balance.

We cannot in Europe, and in the countries of Europe, rely solely on the United States to do it.</p>

      <p sl="en">How are we seeking to undermine this? Not only by attacking NATO, but also by duplicating its structures.

Fourthly, we need increased mobility and a cultural and educational exchange. These two areas of activity are interconnected and complement each other.

      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, I support Mr Onesta’s report, but appeal to you to consider two issues when considering petitions. The first concerns the presentation of the facts and the second concerns the fact that only the petitioner can address the Commission, and not the respondent party. In petition No. 0795/2007, the facts are presented in a biased and tendentious way, and the party affected – the Bulgarian Orthodox Church – was not asked to present its position. During its fact-finding mission in Bulgaria from 27-30 October 2008, the Commission did not ask for the views of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Thus attempts to vilify the Holy Orthodox Church in Bulgaria and to undermine its right to self-determination are promoted by the incorrect judgment on the petition submitted by the ‘Alternative Synod’, thereby creating conditions to mislead the members of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The petitioners are seeking a way to decide the fate of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church not through church canon which has taken shape over centuries, but through the intervention of a secular institution – the ECJ in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Following the schism within the Church which was resolved by canonical process in 1998, the ECJ in Strasbourg has issued a judgment on the same internal ecclesiastical problem in a matter in which the Bulgarian Orthodox Church was not even a respondent. The truth is that no secular court has the authority or the ability to rule on ecclesiastical disputes.</p>

      <p sl="pt">However, we do not agree that the establishment of large-scale infrastructure should only allow the creation of more opportunities to achieve research excellence in certain areas, meaning that certain countries will be the main beneficiaries of this process. We want everyone to be able to benefit, even those who cannot set up centres of excellence, to ensure the democratisation of research in the most diverse areas. That is why we decided to abstain.</p>

Over the years the Community institutions have attached increasing importance to the protection of children’s rights, which must be considered during policy making.

      <p sl="sk">I have voted against this motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="sk">One reason for doing so is because the Commission does not have general authority in the field of fundamental rights including the rights of the child under international agreements or through the jurisdiction of the ECJ (COM(2006) 367, Paragraph 1.3. page 3). The other reason is that the European Union intends to use this resolution to assume powers which it does not have.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The resolution does not recognise the sovereignty of developing nations in the field of ethics. It runs counter to paragraph 9 of the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995, which states ‘The implementation of this platform, including through national laws and the formulation of strategies, policies, programmes and development priorities, is the sovereign responsibility of each State, in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the significance of and full respect for various religious and ethical values, cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions of individuals and their communities should contribute to the full enjoyment by women of their human rights in order to achieve equality, development and peace’.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Finally, the report also spotlights support for sexual and reproductive health, a term which has never been defined by the EU. The WHO and some non-governmental organisations use this term to support abortion. The resolution openly supports sexual and reproductive health in Article 44, without defining it or respecting the European Union’s remit in this area. This is unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I support this initiative which supports employees, as informing and consulting employees are fundamental elements of a social market economy.

      <p sl="sk">I believe that consulting employees is particularly important and justified in two areas: the work-life balance, and the protection of Sunday as a day of rest, which are fundamental pillars of the European Social Model and part of the European cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I personally supported the requirement for Sunday to be a day off with no compulsion to work submitted in written declaration 0009/2009, which is currently in the signing procedure in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As for the work-life balance, this is something I recently addressed in my report on intergenerational solidarity.

      <p sl="it">I also agree that the social economy should however engage with continually evolving market developments, in order to come up with effective strategies to meet its objectives. This may be achieved by setting up networks between the interested parties, as well as through greater cooperation and exchange of experiences at all levels, whether local, national or transnational.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The social economy subscribes to the fundamental principles of the European Social Model. Its basic features and values involve placing people and social objectives above capital, combining the interests of its members with the general good, and implementing a democratic control system, enforced by its members. Overall, it constitutes 10% of Europe’s enterprises and 6% of the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The social economy, which is also referred to as the solidarity economy and the third sector, is a key instrument for attaining the Lisbon objectives. It possesses a significant potential for creating jobs and can effectively be employed to achieve the objective of economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The third sector plays a leading role in the European economy, combining profitability and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the financial crisis, which we have recently been observing with alarm, and vainly attempting to overcome, it is vitally important for us to ensure financial stability. Europeans dread losing their jobs and expect decent treatment. The European Union and the Member States must respond to real needs, create real opportunities and build new hopes, for the good of all Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fostering the solidarity economy is one way of improving the situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I support the rapporteur’s motion. The European Commission should not only promote the social economy, but should also undertake real action to develop a legal framework, within which entities such as cooperatives, mutual societies, associations and foundations may operate, as well as drawing up a programme offering financial support, advice and training to existing enterprises and to those that are yet to be established.</p>

At a time when the cracks in the capitalist system are obvious, it is odd to withdraw proposals that promote alternative and effective types of economic organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Founded on principles of mutualisation and interdependence, the social economy advocates a new concept of business practice that is more human and breaks with the capitalist approach of the simple pursuit of profit. It has been expanding successfully in recent years and today represents 10% of businesses and 6% of jobs in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s attitude may be deplorable, but nonetheless we can feel pleased about Parliament’s vote.

A Europe in which the concept of responsible freedom does not cover solely the free movement of capital and in which citizens pool their abilities irrespective of their social status. A Europe in which creativity is harnessed and the dignity of each citizen is protected for the common good.

Social economies have shown that they can significantly improve the position of disadvantaged people. For example, the micro-loan companies introduced by the Nobel prize winner Muhammad Junus which improved the position and increased the influence of women by enabling them to improve their financial and family situations. Social innovation supports people with disabilities in finding their own solutions to their social problems, a work-life balance, equal opportunities for men and women, quality of family life and the ability to care for children, the elderly and the disabled.</p>

People should be protected from stigmatisation and social exclusion regardless of age, gender, ethnic origin and socio-economic group. Their human dignity is of primary importance, and for this reason more assistance and appropriate therapy should be made available to people with mental health problems, their families and their carers.</p>

This should be recognised as such by sectoral policies. Women and men who voluntarily make the decision to care for sick family members should receive financial compensation. Breaking off a career to care for relatives with mental health problems should not have a negative impact on that career or on providing financially for one’s family.</p>

More efficient energy use is one of the most effective ways of reducing the amount of gas emissions which cause the greenhouse effect and of ensuring that the great EU climate policy plans are implemented.

      <p sl="pl">Rationalising energy consumption is an extremely important activity. The public needs to know that this is the most economical way of combating climate change. However, it is not only the environment that will benefit. The better the use we make of available energy, the less energy we need and, as a result, the less we need to rely on imported energy. In the current situation, where energy is used as a political tool, the importance of this fact cannot be underestimated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are employing energy ever more rationally. The consequences of this policy can be measured. Since 1990, energy production in the EU has risen by 40%, and revenue per capita by 1/3, while energy demand has risen by only 11%. More rational energy management has thus contributed to economic growth in all the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In December 2006 the European Parliament and the Council adopted an important decision on the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013). I congratulate myself on having, at that time, referred to the huge importance of guaranteeing more and better technological development in the area of fisheries and aquaculture.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore believe that this own-initiative report is timely and is extremely important in terms of pursuing the objectives of the new reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP).</p>
      <p sl="pt">The CFP is among the Community policies most dependent on scientific research, given that the credibility of the measures adopted under the CFP rests on high-quality scientific opinions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Furthermore, the technological development of vessels, fishing gear and engines may guarantee the sector’s sustained development in the future, thus better protecting the environment and ensuring that fleets are more competitive.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Scientific fisheries research is vital to ensure an appropriate fisheries management policy, which must take into account the social, environmental and economic aspects of this activity which is an essential source of food.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This research should not only assess the state of fish stocks and generate models allowing their development to be predicted, but should also help to improve fishing gear, vessels, working and safety conditions for fishermen, and the assessment of the impact of the various fisheries management systems/instruments on the employment and income of fishing communities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, in order for scientific fisheries research to meet the objectives set out and the needs indicated, it is vital that the necessary resources, including funding, are made available by the EU and by each Member State. That is why we support the recommendations in this respect in the report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, we believe that the development of scientific research absolutely demands that the value of the human resources involved be recognised. This means guaranteeing the rights of these professionals with regard to employment contracts – by combating the insecure employment relationships with which many of these researchers are faced – fair pay and access to social security schemes, among many other labour rights which workers enjoy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">One of the fundamental freedoms of the EU’s internal market is the freedom of movement, which allows us not only to travel freely within its borders, but also to undertake employment. The number of people availing themselves of this opportunity is continually growing, and the best example of this trend has been the mobility of workers from the new Member States, including Poland, in recent years. At present, around 2% of the EU’s inhabitants live and work in a Member State other than their own.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite the fact that further barriers to a common, internal market have been removed, one of the principal obstacles faced by many people looking to work in a different Member State is the fear that qualifications obtained in other Member States will not be recognised. This concern has prompted today’s report, which calls for the creation of a European professional card for service providers. Introducing such a card might facilitate mobility among the representatives of a number of professions, whilst simultaneously offering employers certainty as to the qualifications held by an employee in possession of such a card, and increasing not only the transparency of qualifications, but also their recognition and comparability.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mrs Cederschiöld’s report on the creation of a European professional card for service providers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I did so because, in my opinion, despite the existence of Directive 2005/36/EC aimed at encouraging professional mobility, this market is still in essence a national one. More generally, workers’ mobility in the European Union remains very low, constituting a barrier to the proper functioning of the internal market as well as the pursuit of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="it">In light of this, I think it is crucial to establish European professional cards, which already exist in some cases, to cover all professions, including those that are not regulated.

One of the main reasons for the EC’s participation in the Observatory is the consideration that the Observatory’s activities are helping to strengthen the competitiveness of the Community’s audiovisual industry.

      <p sl="sv">We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament are in favour of a generous immigration policy centred on people’s needs. This meant that we ultimately chose to support Mr Fava’s report because it sends a clear message to the effect that it is unacceptable for employers to exploit the vulnerable position of migrants with no documents and because it gives certain rights to those migrants with no documents that they currently lack in several of the EU’s Member States. A prerequisite for our being able to vote in favour of the report was the Council’s approval of Parliament’s statement that Article 9 should not be precedential in any way in future, because this could make it more difficult to adopt common rules regarding the liability of contractors for their subcontractors.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is clear to us that contractors need to be responsible for ensuring that their subcontractors observe any collective agreements that have been entered into. Employers must not be able to avoid applying labour law rules by utilising a complex chain of subcontractors. In this directive, however, liability is limited to the first subcontractor level, which is something that we do not consider acceptable. However, it is important to bear in mind that there is nothing to prevent individual Member States introducing more comprehensive legislation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The directive which has just been voted on marks another step towards drafting and applying common regulations and measures required to regulate the situation of immigrants, especially employees from third countries staying illegally in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The prospect of a better standard of living created by the possibility of finding a job is one of the key factors encouraging illegal immigration. At the same time, the consequences of the benefits gained by employers include the waste of public finances and distorted competition in the economic sector, depriving illegal workers of any social insurance or right to a pension.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is the reason why the current directive relates to immigration policy and the sanctions are targeted at employers and not the workers coming from third countries. Particular attention must also be focused on nationals from the new Member States who, in spite of their status as European citizens, are still subject to transnational employment rules, thereby limiting free access for them to the old Member States’ labour market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Measures such as forcing employers to check third-country workers’ residence permits and the financial and criminal penalties provided for employers highlight the efforts of the Community and Member States to coordinate their immigration and illegal labour policies.

      <p sl="sv">I voted in favour of the report on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The proposal aims to prevent the exploitation of illegally staying third-country nationals by employers and to strengthen the rights of workers. The person who is to be punished in the event of illegal employment is the employer who breaks the law, not the worker.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There is an absence of this type of legislation in certain countries within the EU. Other countries have legislation, but it is not implemented or observed. Common EU rules to prevent exploitation and the employment of illegally staying workers are therefore one way of raising the bar for many EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings. If the decision had been mine, many parts of it would have been different. I would have liked to see greater protection for women involved in domestic work, for example. However, the alternative is to have no directive at all and therefore less protection for the four to eight million illegally staying third-country nationals who are currently working illegally within the EU and who, in their very vulnerable situation, are repeatedly exploited by employers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">While it is important to prevent illegal immigration and the exploitation of illegally staying third-country nationals, we must also ensure that we increase the opportunities for people to settle and seek work within the EU on a legal basis.

      <p sl="en">Yet the problem is that there is a vicious conspiracy to keep the exploitation hidden.

      <p sl="en">The general prohibition of employing unauthorised workers to deter illegal immigration can only be viewed favourably, just as sanctions against employers who resort to such workers – often to exploit them – can only be viewed favourably; such employers are nothing more than modern-day slave-traders.</p>

Once again the European Union is making use of an issue relying on a Community legal basis, the first pillar, to extend its competences with regard to harmonisation of the criminal law of Member States.

Its management claims to be the victim of a labour market that is too rigid or protective of a workforce to whom they pay the legal minimum wage, and the greater opportunities for regularisation through working have been opened up. The directive will further strengthen these by making it possible for an illegal worker to regularise his status simply by reporting his employer.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fear that in practice, in countries as lax as France in this respect, all this will do nothing to limit the influx of illegal immigration.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Regardless of the need to strengthen procedures aimed at combating the use of illegal workers, it is unacceptable that this directive punishes both the transgressor and the victims.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The aim of this directive is to complement the shameful ‘Return’ Directive – which the Socialist Government in Portugal has adopted – by applying sanctions to employers of illegally staying workers and laying down, as a general and automatic rule, the procedure for expelling these workers, with rare exceptions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Expulsion should not be the alternative to over-exploitation of illegally staying migrant workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This directive does not adopt the principle of protecting migrant workers and safeguarding those who, being forced to work in unacceptable conditions, report them. In addition, the directive does not fully protect the rights of these workers as it states that ‘when back payments are not made by the employer, Member States should not be obliged to fulfil this obligation’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By not protecting the rights of illegally staying migrant workers, given that it does not provide in general for their regularisation and instead exposes them to the threat of expulsion, this directive will make these workers more vulnerable and encourage illegal work situations which are even more hidden.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although this report is interesting on a number of points and sketches out a battle plan against illegal immigration, it contains some enormous stumbling-blocks. There are no specific measures to protect the internal and external borders of the Union. There are no measures in relation to the policy of expelling illegal immigrants back to their country of origin. It simply defines a person who has entered the territory of the Union illegally as an illegal immigrant who has rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">In reality, European institutions are embarrassed by this issue. On the one hand, in the name of security and justice, they are demanding a minimum of European rules to curb illegal immigration and, on the other, in the name of their rules that have become dogma – those of ultraliberalism and of freedom of movement – they want the territory of the Union to become a place for receiving and attracting millions of prospective immigrants.</p>

However, we must take care that it does not lose its effectiveness as the reasons why people migrate remain the same, regardless of whether penalties are introduced against the employers or not.

      <p sl="de">The prospect of finding work in Europe is attractive for third-country nationals for very understandable reasons. In times of crisis, however, we need to pay particular attention to who gets the ever scarcer jobs in order to prevent social discrepancies from arising as well. In my opinion, therefore, it is important to impose sanctions on employers who do not follow the rules. In these unsettled times, illegal labour cannot be tolerated, and we must start with those that are within reach locally and where sanctions will also have an effect. This report is thus an attempt to tackle this problem more forcefully, because the in-flow of migrant workers is not going to decrease, particularly during the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Based on a simple view of this issue, there are two reasons why there are illegal immigrants: the precarious situation in the country of origin and labour market demand in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Whereas, in regard to the first problem, we have funds for development and cooperation programmes supported by the EU and which are obviously still not sufficient, in the case of the second matter, the problem has to date been dealt with in different ways at Member State level. However, standard provisions are needed at Community level for punishing employers as, in many cases, this is a transnational issue, involving human trafficking networks which exploit the vulnerability of illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am pleased that the issue of employers who benefit at the expense of illegal immigrants has been raised for discussion by the European Parliament. I am convinced that applying this directive will improve practical employment conditions within the Community.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Whereas until now, countries’ policies have focused more on how to prevent illegal immigrants gaining access to the labour market, from now on, we are tackling the problem at its root.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, however, we must not interpret this report as meaning that the EU’s borders are going to be closed. Far from it, we need to keep the labour market borders open, with the proviso that the flow of workers is legal and suited to the relevant state’s needs.</p>

We must remember that growth targets for unemployment and the economy in general can only be reached by encouraging total compliance with labour laws.</p>

I give this opinion as coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the former TDIP temporary committee and for the subsequent working group within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="it">The aforesaid committee decided to send a questionnaire to each Member State in order to clarify what developments had taken place following the European Parliament’s investigation. To date however, as you are well aware, no response has been received to these questionnaires, even after written reminders were sent.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not therefore think it wise to adopt a new text claiming to make new conclusions when in reality we have nothing new to make public. I have the feeling this is yet another electoral stunt by the Left, rather than an attempt to see justice.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted against the motion for a resolution on the alleged CIA activities involving the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in some European countries as the purpose of this resolution is unfounded.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Firstly, I would like to emphasise that, from a procedural perspective, the political groups which signed this resolution ought to have waited for the replies from the national parliaments to the letter from President Pöttering dated 9 February 2009, which requested details of the measures taken by Member States following the February 2007 resolution on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The accusations levelled against Romania, according to which it had been involved in the terrorist suspect transfer programme, are unfounded. It is therefore unacceptable for Romania’s name to be freely bandied about as part of the discussion on alleged CIA prisons.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I intend to use my vote to support the motion for a resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners. I believe it is extremely important to implement in full the recommendations made by this Parliament in the report by the temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners because the existence of secret detention centres, enforced disappearances and the torture of detainees are not only a flagrant violation of international human rights law, the UN Convention on Torture, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights but also cannot be tolerated in an international system governed by democracy and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason I welcome the resolution, which urges all Member States to bring to light the abuse committed in this context in the name of the war on terror, since a genuine and effective war on terror cannot be fought by breaching the very same human rights and fundamental freedoms it is supposed to defend.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As regards the intergovernmental dimension, I feel that we need to establish a clear timetable of meetings at ministerial level involving the 27 Member States with their counterparts from the Eastern Partnership countries. Obviously, in the case of Belarus, the EU Council’s decision to resume negotiations with both the government in Minsk and with all the democratic forces in this country must be supported. Belarus’s authoritarian regime must understand that the EU stipulates as a firm condition of any cooperation the need to respect democratic principles and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Just like two others debated and adopted in this sitting, this report is also very ambitious.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I gave Mr Jacek Sarysz-Wolski’s report, on the main features of the common foreign and security policy, my unequivocal support. The Council’s report for 2007 provides a fitting description of these issues. It would be difficult not to agree that the financial resources earmarked for implementing the CFSP are far from sufficient, particularly in circumstances involving aggressive terrorist activity. The right to live in peace and with a sense of security is an EU priority. That security has multiple dimensions: political, military, energy, food, and so on. Cooperation with other countries plays an enormous role in this field. The particular importance of transatlantic relations with the USA and Canada should be acknowledged, as should the closer cooperation between the EU and NATO. The Eastern Partnership may be acknowledged as very promising. In this regard, relations with Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus are worthy of note. The EU can also exert a positive influence on the situation in the Middle East. The recent conflict in the Gaza Strip has demonstrated the dramatic circumstances in which the people of that region live, be they Palestinian or Jewish.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the field of security, the EU’s actions will only be effective if we speak and act as one. Focusing on individual interests can only bring temporary benefits. Moreover, universal solidarity requires particular respect for fundamental values and human rights, as well as the dignity and freedom to which every individual is entitled. The role that suitable diplomatic efforts, including the use of so-called preventive diplomacy, can play in this field is by no means a minor one.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As apparent from the debate and the report on the common foreign and security policy, the European Union’s ambition in terms of foreign policy is huge. It is clearly apparent from the facts that the EU’s role in the world does not match up to this ambition. However, not only is its role growing, but in the vast majority of cases the Member States are in agreement and act in cooperation. The sharing of values, principles and priorities between the 27 Member States of the European Union is much more widespread than may be suggested by the times of disagreement. This is exactly as to be expected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I support strengthening the agreement on which our priorities and criteria for action are based.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The recognition, however, that there are disagreements which basically stem from the existence of different interests and priorities does not lead me to conclude that the EU is irrelevant in the world or that a single foreign policy needs to be imposed on all the Member States, contrary to their own interests or even their own history. A community is being built and this process, albeit slow, has more chance of succeeding than the desire to impose a single approach, which is not essential.</p>

The pretexts for EU intervention, the so-called 'threats' against its security, are constantly expanding, including sectors, in addition to 'terrorism', such as climate change, energy security, cyberspace, regional clashes, maritime transport and even space. In fact, the EU is reserving the 'right' of military intervention where and when it deems necessary for its imperialist interests and, more to the point, not only against third countries and peoples, but also against the peoples of its Member States, in order to defend the power of the monopolies as and when necessary.</p>

Apart from the strong moral argument that we had a responsibility to protect those facing the genocide of the Serbs, we also had the consequences of tens/hundreds of thousands of refugees. We, in our own and their interests, must have the capacity to engage without the Americans. To do this, it is a small price we pay to have a permanent EU Operational Military HQ ready for such a future eventuality.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Like the report on ‘the role of NATO in the security architecture of the EU’, this report (and resolution) reasserts the objective of affirming and consolidating the EU as a political and military bloc with an offensive nature, in partnership with the US and within the framework of NATO.</p>

It actually goes even further as it ‘calls for the setting-up of an … EU Operational Headquarters’.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Looking around Europe it is clear that, in terms of security, the European Union has, and must have, its own strategic concerns and priorities. This is dictated by the geography, and also by the geopolitics. Saying this does not in any way correspond to an idea of security or a concern for defence conceived as an alternative to our alliances, not least our alliance with the United States. Saying this does, however, correspond to an idea of European responsibility. If we want security, then we must be ready to bear the burdens that this brings, whether physical or human. It also necessitates an agreement on what is common and what can be shared in this concern for security and among these burdens. Security has a price, and the demand for greater multilateralism on our allies’ part imposes an added cost. The next period will be demanding in this respect.

      <p sl="fr">I voted against this report, presented by the French Christian Democrat, Mr Vatanen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text of this report relates to the role of NATO in the security architecture of the European Union. It is an important issue that needs to be considered. In my opinion, however, the answers given in this report were not good ones and they left the root of the problem unresolved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By my vote, I certainly did not wish to deny the role that Europe has to play internationally. As an economic and demographic power, it is expected to act according to its values and must do so in order to maintain peace and intercultural dialogue. Strengthening the European Union’s military credibility is, however, indispensable. That is why I am emphasising my commitment to creating a European security and defence policy that has real autonomy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my opinion, this is not what Mr Vatanen’s report promises. Some stumbling blocks remain, in particular concerning denuclearisation and relations with Russia. The number of amendments tabled proves it (265): the text of the report was far from achieving unanimous approval. It does not address the main concern which is to ensure that Europe has a strong defence and cooperates with NATO, but is not subservient to it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In the area of security and defence, the actions carried out by the European Union as a global player have taken the form of intervention to prevent conflict, thereby giving it the status of the main promoter of peace in the world. While, at the end of the Cold War, there were questions raised about NATO’s role, the new threats to security and progress noted by Europeans in the area of defence and the implementation of civil-military operations in different parts of the world highlight the need for a new arrangement for EU-NATO cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the present context, the lack of any common European foreign policy and discrepancies between Member States in the area of funding and military technological capacity make NATO a vital partner for managing military crises.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Adopting a division of labour whereby ESDP supports civil operations and NATO ensures the rapid deployment of numerous military forces should guarantee that both organisations complement and not compete with each other. Consequently, the rapporteur’s suggestion to create an EU operational headquarters could serve precisely this objective by complementing the current NATO command structures in the area of joint civil and military operations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, we must also take into account in future EU-NATO relations the situation of states in Eastern Europe. With this in mind, it is important to promote an open-door policy and support a constructive dialogue with Russia aimed at establishing collective security in this part of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">NATO played an important role during the Cold War between 1949 and 1989. Its official task was to defend the Member States’ common territory against foreign invasions, without taking action outside of that territory. The justification was the defence of a pluriform democracy against dictatorships, but in practice it was mainly about protecting a capitalist economy from a socialist economy. The right-wing dictatorships in Portugal and Greece were allowed to join in, there were bilateral agreements with a similar dictatorship in Spain, and the French colony of Algeria was forced to belong to NATO territory until 1962. When the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact disappeared, this NATO lost its raison d’être . Its continued existence is a problem for the EU, because six Member States have opted for military neutrality. The current NATO is still more of a ‘coalition of the willing’ around the USA than an extension of the EU. This year, just as NATO is turning 60, it will have to be apparent what future role NATO will claim. If it is that of the world’s policeman, carrying out its own projects independently of the United Nations with a view to benefiting the economically most powerful states, this organisation will prove harmful and superfluous.

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the Vatanen report as a realistic appraisal of European security. Although we would like to draw up a European security policy capable of meeting the security needs of all EU members, we must accept that a security structure already exists which acts as the centre of gravity of the majority of EU Member States’ defence. I am talking about NATO.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I would like to emphasise the importance of using the comparative benefits of the two organisations in order to draw up a solid humanitarian intervention policy. No matter what terms are used to formulate the European Security Strategy, the EU ‘mosaic’ will allow us to intervene in complex areas where diplomacy or limited intervention are only possible thanks to the EU’s unrivalled capacity for subtlety. By the same token, we have in NATO a solid alliance, with tried-and-tested mechanisms, which we Europeans must not stop resorting to in order to reduce the suffering which some conflicting forces are causing with impunity. A first step towards this consolidation may be an operational headquarters for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The location of Europe dictates its security priorities and concerns. However, the integration of Europe and the 27 Member States within a set of values and a model of society which, in a broad sense, we call the western world also defines the threats and our security context. For that reason, the alliance that most EU Member States share with the United States, among others, is and must continue to be a central element in our security.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the year in which we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Atlantic Alliance, it is time to rethink its strategic concept and bring it into line with the new reality. Following the end of the Cold War, it is time to move beyond the end of the end of the Cold War and bring these concepts into line with the new reality that is forming: the emergence of the Pacific, the greater relevance of Asia, the role that Russia is seeking to redefine for itself, and the threats posed by failed states and global terrorist groups, among others.</p>

It sets out the objective of the ‘creation of a … Euro-Mediterranean free trade area’ and not a ‘Euro-Mediterranean partnership … based on equality of treatment, solidarity, dialogue and respect for the specific asymmetries and characteristics of each country’, as we proposed in an amendment that we tabled.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why we voted against.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We support increased cooperation with countries in the Mediterranean region, but we cannot lend our support to increased EU power within integration policy, formulated in paragraph 29. We also regret the fact that the report does not impose any requirements on occupying powers such as Israel and Morocco.

      <p sl="nl">The Mediterranean is the EU’s southern border. For many years, the EU has pursued close cooperation with coastal states that do not belong to the EU and some of which will never be able to join the EU. This cooperation is deemed important in the south of Europe but is of far less significance to the rest of Europe. Despite this, there are no major differences of opinion about this, because nobody objects to good relations at the EU’s external borders. Mainly on France’s initiative, this cooperation has been further intensified lately. In this connection, separate, permanent structures have been put in place. The question is what the purpose of these permanent structures is. Is it an attempt to move closer towards the Syrian and Libyan dictatorships, which are constantly violating human rights? Is it an attempt to find an alternative to full EU membership that has been promised in the long term to the coastal states of Croatia, Montenegro, Albania and Turkey? Is it a means of further tightening the ties with Israel despite the fact that, as a result of the election result on 10 February, no Israeli cooperation can be expected for the next four years in establishing a neighbouring Palestinian state with equal rights? I cannot endorse this proposal for the time being.</p>

      <p sl="de">The projects proposed by the newly-formed Union for the Mediterranean all sound well and good: the Solar Plan, collaboration in civil protection, joint initiatives for the depollution of the Mediterranean and new port and motorway projects. However, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper. Whether anything will actually be done is doubtful. After all, the organisation’s predecessor, Euromed, did not actually achieve anything. Moreover, as long as the participating states do not see any actual possibility of these projects coming to fruition, they will surely not sacrifice existing good bilateral relations for the sake of a vague project.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I do not believe that the new Union for the Mediterranean will be any more successful than its predecessor organisation, I have voted against this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for this report. I believe that the concept of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which first took shape in the Barcelona Declaration in 1995, is ready to be taken forward in a more practical and effective manner than has been the case hitherto. I am pleased that the rapporteur supports the decision to reinforce the democratic legitimacy of the Union for the Mediterranean by enhancing the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. This is because I firmly believe that establishing a serious, lasting partnership ought to go beyond the scope of mere economic cooperation and financial support – although these are undoubtedly important – and should enable the objectives of peace and institutional stability, as well as prosperity and economic growth, to be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="it">I share the rapporteur's hopes that the strengthening of Euro-Mediterranean relations will provide a boost to the development of an area of collective and individual security, going beyond the area covered by the agreement, and that the European Union can contribute to the promotion of the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and mutual understanding between different peoples and cultures; these, unfortunately, are still often seriously infringed even in countries with which the EU maintains regular economic relations. To this end, I hope that the instruments to be made available will be adequate in terms of achieving the ambitious goals that this partnership is setting itself.</p>

      <p sl="pl">What is of significance to me is that the agreement, within the framework of the Barcelona Process, facilitates the regulation of many regional strategic issues such as energy security, environmental protection and water management.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to draw your attention to the substantial progress that has been made in terms of creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone, which is to be definitively established in 2010. At the same time, I would like to emphasise the need for considerably broader cooperation in the following sectors: services (medical and educational), agriculture, as this provides the basis for the region’s economy, and, in conjunction with the latter, the monitoring of food security.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to raise the issue of supporting democratic change in the Mediterranean region. In my opinion, this issue goes hand in hand with the need to promote social integration and support the activities of the inhabitants in the countries of that region. Dialogue, the promotion of multicultural and religious tolerance, as well as educational projects, may pave the way for a peaceful solution to the conflicts in which those countries are currently involved.</p>

      <p sl="en">the Mediterranean component of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument should complement the Barcelona Process, and the ENP’s objectives need to be more clearly defined in order to strengthen the Barcelona Process by favouring a multilateral regional approach;</p>
      <p sl="en">there should be enhanced EU involvement in the Black Sea region and an ambitious Eastern Partnership.

      <p sl="en">an Eastern Neighbourhood assembly (‘Euroeast’), with the participation of the European Parliament, should be created on the same lines as the Euromed and EuroLat assemblies with a view to implementing the ENPI in the countries of eastern Europe, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I voted for the report. At a time as delicate as the present, I would argue that we need enhanced cooperation in neighbourhood and partnership relations in order to establish a friendly environment in the closest environs of the European Union, as the ENP's main objective sets out.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope to see greater integration and a resulting rapprochement in the economic and political spheres between the European Union and neighbouring countries, and am therefore in full agreement with the report by Mr Konrad Szymański. It calls on the Commission, together with the partner governments, to further develop mechanisms for consultation with civil society and local authorities, in order to better involve them in the design and monitoring of the ENPI’s implementation. It also urges the Commission and national, regional and local authorities to promote twinning programmes between towns and regions and, in addition, calls for the annual action programmes in the fields of democracy, the rule of law and human rights to be pursued more ambitiously, in line with the objectives set up in the ENP action plans, asking for more to be done to persuade the partner governments to commit themselves to action in those fields.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I supported Mr Konrad Szymanowski’s report on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. It is a worthwhile EU initiative, aimed at fostering cooperation between the EU and partner states. This cooperation includes, amongst others, efforts to promote dialogue and reform, environmental protection and action in the field of energy security. It also includes efforts to reduce poverty, promote equality between women and men, promote employment and social protection, foster cross-border cooperation, promote health, education and human rights, combat terrorism and organised crime, and promote cooperation in the scientific, educational, innovation and cultural spheres. It is therefore essential to conduct a substantive and financial review of all ENPI Operational Programmes, taking into account the countries, the regions and the issues involved. These activities should expand the free trade zone.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is important to note that the Eastern Partnership should not hinder neighbouring countries wishing to apply for membership of the EU. The section which mentions the EUR 500 billion allocated to Georgia between 2008-2010 for reconstruction work and aid to refugees, following the depredations of war, is also worthy of support. I also accept that it is advisable to review our cooperation with Belarus, along with the level of funding allocated to that country, in order to ascertain whether the policy of re-engagement with that country, initiated in September 2008, should be continued. Furthermore, I agree that we need to guarantee that any financial assistance granted to Russia contributes to strengthening democratic standards in that country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Neighbourhood Policy is a vital instrument for ensuring stability in the area to the east of the EU. Indeed, recent events in the region such as the crisis in Georgia and the gas crisis have demonstrated once again the need for the EU to have a strategy capable of ensuring that it plays an active role in this area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support this report because it highlights the importance of initiatives such as the Black Sea Synergy and the Eastern Partnership. They are particularly worthwhile in consolidating cooperation with the countries in the region, especially Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, but also the states from the Caucasus and the Caspian Region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also point out that effective implementation of the ENP cannot be achieved without increasing the level of financial support to the programmes funded via the ENPI and ensuring a higher level of transparency in the allocation of funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, the majority of these resources must be allocated with a view to involving civil society in the partner countries in common projects and to supporting the mobility of their citizens. The ENPI can become more effective through greater rapprochement by the citizens from the partner countries and by encouraging the process of Europeanisation at every level. For this reason, I support the removal of the obstacles blocking the free movement of persons coming from these countries, especially through easing the visa requirements applied to these states.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Trans-border cooperation is an important stimulus for the sustainable development of neighbouring border regions. More intensive contacts between people and personal experience of democracy and rule of law are important preconditions for the optimum implementation of projects under the European Neighbourhood Policy, which it is why we need to create specific instruments to ensure appropriate monitoring of how common operational programmes are managed and implemented on both sides of the EU’s borders.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I welcome the fact that in his report on reviewing the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Policy Instrument the rapporteur Konrad Szymański included trans-border cooperation within the remit of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). I have voted for the report, which will facilitate the negotiating process for countries applying for membership to the EU. Countries such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova will be able to get closer to the EU by benefiting from the ENP.</p>
      <p sl="sk">My views are to some extent based on my experience during the implementation of the Community INTERREG IIIA initiative involving a joint Slovak-Polish drainage project for the community of Chmeľnica on the Slovak and the Polish town of Piwniczna either side of our common border.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that we need to support any initiative aimed at specialist training, including learning the languages of neighbouring countries and partnership initiatives for government employees. I believe that proper analysis in respect of increasing capacity and building institutions on both sides of the EU’s borders, as proposed by the rapporteur, will contribute towards the implementation of this instrument.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the report by Mr Szymański on the review of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. I believe we must admit that in some of the countries covered by the instrument, no progress at all has been made towards the initial objectives of promoting democracy, stability and good governance, integration and economic convergence with the policies of the European Union. While, on the one hand, assistance and a neighbourhood approach by the EU may act as a stimulus for the dissemination and implementation of good practice, it is, however, true that it is vital for this assistance and the financial aid granted by the EU to be conditional.</p>
      <p sl="it">On this point, I agree with my fellow Member in believing that sectoral and general budget support under the ENPI should be made available only to governments which are able to implement it in a transparent, effective and accountable manner and where it constitutes a real incentive; for this very reason, however, I cannot agree to a review of the ENPI as set out in his report. Much work still remains to be done before we can talk of the development of a genuine free trade area, otherwise there is a risk of a worsening of the already weak socio-institutional conditions in the countries involved and the squandering of huge resources by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the report by Mr Berman on financing of actions other than Official Development Assistance in countries falling under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the rapporteur that the legislative proposal put forward by Parliament ought to ensure that countries which do not fulfil the criteria for classification as eligible for Official Development Assistance, but which are open to the promotion of political, economic and governance values similar to those of the Community and with which the Community has strategic relations, should be supported on projects deserving attention. Examples are the creation of partnerships between economic, academic and scientific operators, particularly in sectors of great importance such as scientific and technological research, transport, energy and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that this can only be of benefit, not only to the countries involved and the European Union, but also to the entire international community, subject to proper assessment of eligibility for funding and the validity of the project in question at any particular time.</p>

I agree with the call by Mrs Dahl to European institutions to alter the legal bases for interinstitutional bodies in such a way as to permit a clear allocation of administrative and political responsibilities, since at the moment it is difficult to identify these.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the use of information is the main way to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and, in this context, multilingualism must be the key instrument in putting into practice the aims of the Publications Office through the simultaneous publication of the Official Journal in all the European Union official languages, so as to ensure that it is clearly understood by everyone.

It simply assumes that all citizens use the Internet and can find their way around the EU website without difficulty. However, this is not the case, as the web pages are often only understandable to insiders and are also not always intelligible in all languages. Many states also have a strong tradition of printed media, which are an important means of providing non-partisan information to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU is always emphasising the importance of information policy, but in this regard is allowing an information gap to develop. Firstly, the broadsheets will suffer huge losses if the Official Journal entries that are required to be published are dropped and, secondly, all those who are not familiar with modern technology will be at a disadvantage.
