      <p sl="de">Madam President, on our agenda today we have the Commission statement on the partnership agreements with the ACP countries and a resolution is planned for this debate. Our Group, this morning and in recent days, has held very intensive debates on this resolution. We have also tried very hard to work out a compromise resolution with other groups, with a view to reaching such a compromise. Unfortunately, that has proved impossible. Nonetheless, we do not want to give up on this task and we are still attempting to reach a compromise before we have to resort to contested votes.</p>
      <p sl="de">On behalf of my Group, I therefore propose that the resolution on this Commission statement and the vote on that resolution be postponed until the December part-session. I would be grateful to the Members of this House if they could support this course of action, which would offer some scope for negotiations on a compromise.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am rather surprised at this proposal from the Socialist Group. The joint motion for a resolution by the Socialists, the Greens and my Group incorporated the resolution adopted in Kigali. In Kigali, the members of the PPE-DE Group also agreed to this compromise, so I simply cannot understand why everything should now be postponed for further debate when, together, Members of this House had already reached an agreement. The fact is that everyone agreed to this compromise in Kigali! I am therefore opposed to this postponement because the document in question has been endorsed by a large number of Members already and could be voted on today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, just so that there are no misunderstandings: the problem is not the substance; the problem is that they want to ensure that they get a majority. I think that is legitimate. You are absolutely right, Mr Markov; the proposal implies that the debate should start again, which is hard to understand, but the Socialists’ idea – let’s see – is about securing a majority to endorse what everyone wants to achieve anyway. That is the issue and that is the reason why they want a postponement. That is all.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr de Deus Pinheiro has just mentioned the Christmas spirit. I am also in favour of the Christmas spirit, but we should not overdo it. After all, in that spirit, we were quite willing to have a compromise coming from Kigali.</p>
      <p sl="de">As to Venezuela, there are always going to be differences of opinion, indeed controversy, in any debate about Mr Chávez. We believe the debate is useful – indeed, it is now being held – but we are not convinced that we can get a sensible resolution in the short time available today or tomorrow. If we take this resolution forward to the December part-session, it will be three weeks old by then. It is very useful to have the debate now, but we do not want a resolution because it will either be cobbled together or will come far too late. I think we should have the debate today, and that will be enough.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0445/2007) by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the approval by the European Parliament of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union (2007/2218(ΑCI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-037" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Manuel Lobo Antunes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the solemn proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on 12 December in Strasbourg by the Presidents of the Council, Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates, the European Parliament and the European Commission will undoubtedly be one of the most significant moments in the recent history of the Union and the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We will be taking a step forward that will have important and concrete implications for the consolidation of the universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity. Thanks to the new Lisbon Treaty, the Charter will have the same value as the Treaties; in other words it will be legally binding. This fact, given its importance, must be duly underlined and is something of which this Parliament, the national governments and the Commission should all be proud. It marks the end of a long road.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The impact of the decision to give the Charter of Fundamental Rights legal value goes beyond the usual political and diplomatic circles as it directly affects the legal affairs of our citizens. It is a concrete result of Europe. Clearly, the institutional reforms of the Lisbon Treaty are important and it is also true that the changes made to EU policies, to the common foreign and security policy, to the justice and home affairs policy and in other areas are vital so that the Union can tackle the future and meet the challenges facing us. However, the existence of a catalogue of rights, which is binding on the European institutions and on the Member States when they apply European law, has a meaning far beyond all this. From now on we are putting our citizens at the centre of the European project.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we are talking about fundamental rights, I also want, on behalf of the Presidency and also on behalf of my own country, to express my delight at the Protocol of the Lisbon Treaty which provides for the accession of the Union to the European Convention on Human Rights. That is because this Protocol represents the achievement of a long-held ambition.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to all of this, I must congratulate this Parliament and Mr Leinen on the adoption of this draft report on 12 November by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. This has once again shown the commitment of this House to the Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It only remains for me to express my sincere desire that the House will also find itself able to vote in favour of this report, thus allowing the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be solemnly proclaimed by the three institutions on 12 December.</p>

    <intervention id="3-038" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Margot Wallström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be a key instrument in our Union based on the rule of law. It contains a real catalogue of rights that all citizens of the Union should enjoy, from the individual rights related to dignity, freedoms, equality and solidarity to the rights linked to citizenship status and justice. The Charter will not alter the Union’s competences, but it will offer strengthened rights and greater freedom for citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union will be bound by the rights written into the Charter, and the same obligations will be incumbent upon the Member States when they implement the Union’s legislation. Citizens will be able to claim before the courts the rights enshrined in the Charter, and the legal scrutiny of the Court of Justice will ensure that the Charter is applied correctly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the fact that the legally binding force of the Charter has been preserved through the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference. Like Parliament, we would have preferred to see the Charter apply to all 27 Member States, with no exceptions to its full justiciability, but we should not underestimate the results achieved. Legal force is a major step forward in building a legitimate and accountable Union, where citizens’ interests are the focus of attention. This was not obvious at the outset and it has been a long road to achieving this goal fully.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Charter proclaimed in 2000 was not legally binding. During the European Convention in 2002-2003 and in the IGC that followed in 2003-2004, the Charter was adapted in order to make it legally binding, but that process was stopped due to the failure to ratify the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the European Council in June 2007, it was agreed that the future new Treaty would contain a cross-reference to the Charter, as adapted and finally approved in 2004, and that it would have the same legal value as the Treaties, and this is now reflected in the new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur is proposing that Parliament should approve the Charter, which is a necessary step before its solemn proclamation, and, of course, the Commission fully supports this recommendation. The Commission will also approve the Charter next week and authorise the President to proclaim it on 12 December, together with the Presidents of Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proclamation of the revised Charter will provide the basis for a cross-reference in the new Treaty that will be signed the following day in Lisbon, extending the legal value and justiciability to the rights enshrined in it.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the new Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Union will undeniably enhance its protection of human rights. The European Union is not only a marketplace but also a common space based on values and common rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">rapporteur. − Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is a core element of the Lisbon Treaty; indeed, we could even call it the soul of the new Reform Treaty. I am pleased that all three institutions agree that the Lisbon Treaty is not just about institutions or about policies; it is about people, namely the 500 million people in the European Union. This Charter is a visible expression of the fact that the European Union is concerned about protecting our citizens in respect of all acts emanating from the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Charter of Fundamental Rights is thus a milestone. We are moving from a Europe of the states to a Europe of the citizens, and we in the European Parliament have always welcomed this development. With this Charter and the 50 rights and freedoms contained within it, the European Union will have the most modern and comprehensive catalogue of fundamental rights in the world. Nothing of the sort exists anywhere else in the world, so we should be proud of this achievement. Starting with Article 1, which talks about protecting human dignity, all the way through the Charter to the final Article, which deals with the right not to be punished twice for the same criminal offence, the Charter provides enhanced protection of rights and also mentions rights which are not necessarily found in all the constitutions of the 27 Member States. I would simply draw your attention to the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings through modern genetic technology, the right to protection of personal data, the right to freedom of information and the right of access to documents, but also the right to good administration, ‘good governance’, which is what we preach to the rest of the world, but which must naturally apply to ourselves as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">For the first time, a catalogue of fundamental rights puts economic and social rights on an equal footing with political rights and civil liberties. In an age of globalisation, I am confident that this provides people with adequate protection. As Parliament has repeatedly pointed out, it is regrettable that the new Treaty does not reproduce the text of the Charter in full, so it will not be as visible as it might have been. However, I think we should note, with satisfaction, Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty which states: ‘The Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties.’ That removes any doubts for citizens of the European Union by confirming that, with this Treaty, they do have the opportunity to assert their rights before the national courts and, ultimately, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="de">We still have to adopt this Charter again in plenary because it has been amended, and it could be said that it is not as good as the Charter from 2000, unfortunately. I am referring especially to the watering down of Article 52, and there may be problems interpreting the very vague clauses you will find in that Article. Nonetheless, the Charter has been rescued and is going to be part of the Treaties. I believe that the Charter is a symbol. As has been said in this House, the EU is not just a large market with an associated currency union; the EU is a community of values, and its task is to defend these values in its internal policies and in Europe’s external policies as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is all the more regrettable that there is an opt-out for two Member States, namely the United Kingdom and Poland. We find this regrettable and I would like to appeal to the governments and parliaments of those two countries to spare no effort to revoke this opt-out as quickly as possible so that all 27 Member States are operating on the same basis when it comes to defending the fundamental rights and values of the European Union. I therefore support the adoption of the Greens’ amendment here, which will be voted on tomorrow as an addendum to our report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of this important report.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, this morning my Group celebrated and commemorated the approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Today the members of my Group are wearing a badge which says ‘Yes to the Europe of values’.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect I agree with what previous speakers have said, particularly Madam Wallström, about the European Union not being just a market. The European Union is a political project, but one based on principles and values which unite all European people.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a result, Madam President, today is a good day, with a resolution that will allow us to celebrate and solemnly proclaim this Charter of Fundamental Rights during the next Strasbourg part-session.</p>
      <p sl="es">In fact, I will not be revealing any secrets by saying that those of us who had the good fortune to participate in the drafting of this Charter in the first Convention were left with a bitter aftertaste. This was for two reasons, the first being that, although we drafted the Charter as if it were to be legally binding, in the end this was not possible in Nice because six governments rejected this.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, time has proven us right and now the Charter, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, will be legally binding. That bitter aftertaste has now been converted into satisfaction.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second reason, Madam President, is that I remember how in Nice there was no solemn proclamation of the Charter. A great opportunity was lost to explain to the European people that the rights and freedoms proclaimed in the Charter are our identifying marks, for it was signed in secret.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, thanks to the determination of the President of the European Parliament and our three representatives in this Intergovernmental Conference, on 12 December during the Strasbourg part-session we will achieve what they failed to achieve in Nice. We will solemnly proclaim this Charter and will reaffirm, as the members of the PPE-DE Group have done, our commitment to these rights and freedoms set out in this Charter.</p>

In so doing, we will be plugging a major gap. The European institutions as such are not bound as yet in a watertight way to respect the same rights that all our Member States respect by virtue of their own constitutions or by virtue of their membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. This Charter will be binding on the European institutions, and the whole field of Community law must respect those rights, failing which European legislation can be struck down in the courts.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is surprising that some Euro-sceptics who, one would think, would be pleased that the European institutions are obliged – are constrained – to act in this way, are opposing this Charter – yet some of them are! It is perhaps unfortunate that, as a result of that, some Member States have felt it necessary to clarify, in a protocol, how the Charter interacts with their domestic law.</p>
      <p sl="en">That has, in turn, given rise to confusion. A colleague just now referred to that as an ‘opt-out’; it is, of course, not an opt-out. The Charter remains binding on the European institutions and on the full field of Community law, irrespective of how it affects domestic law in certain countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the solemn proclamation of the Charter is the climax of our work, stretching back to 1999, aimed at creating a superior form of rights regime for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since the principal purpose of the Charter is to protect citizens from abuse of the large powers now vested in the Union, it is bizarre and regrettable that a Member State should seek to escape its binding effect. It is my belief that the British protocol will be found to be juridically flawed, as well as a serious political mistake.</p>
      <p sl="de">The courts are bound to develop jurisprudence for the entire Union system that is blind to nationality and faithful to the key principle of Union law, which is that we draw our fundamental rights from the traditions that are common to all our Member States, as opposed to being exclusive to one. In my view, and that of my Group, the British opt-out is shameful and should fade to oblivion as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in 2000 the Charter of Fundamental Rights was drawn up as a declaration of the values that were to guide the Union’s policy. The Union itself was to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights. At that juncture, the European Court of Justice was to cease ruling on the basis of general legal principles derived from the constitutions of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is now 2007 and the Union is to accede to the European Convention, but not, however, so that it becomes the only European system for protecting human rights. We are creating an alternative system based on a legally binding charter of rights. In many respects this is a first. General legal principles will remain the third set of grounds for rulings in matters concerning fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All this is complicating the system for protecting fundamental rights in Europe, and making it even less comprehensible to the citizens. Many Europeans are concerned about the situation. Essentially, these are the reasons why two Member States opted for protocols protecting against the unexpected consequences of the effects of the Charter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, today, I am proud to be a Member of this House which from the very first day has been a stalwart champion of fundamental and civil rights in general and this Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular. It is now nine years since the Cologne Summit took the initiative to start working towards a legally binding Charter, and this process is not yet complete.</p>
      <p sl="de">As somebody who has been privileged to follow this constitutional process all the way through, I would like to share two experiences with you. One is very ironic: it is odd that, over these nine years, nothing has proved to be so laborious and controversial, or as difficult to achieve, as those documents which embody the principles which form the very basis of the European Union and which we should be able to take for granted: democracy, parliamentary rights, social rights, the market economy, transparency of legislation and fundamental freedoms and rights. It is a very odd situation and must surely have to do with the root causes of the crisis of confidence besetting the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second experience which I would like to share with you is this: it is important not to become exhausted or disenchanted, and it is important not to lose heart. I have long believed that Sisyphus is the patron saint of Europe, and this whole experience bears this out. That is why I think that, today of all days, we should try again and appeal to the United Kingdom and Poland, in the name of the indivisibility of fundamental rights, in the name of the indivisibility of human rights and fundamental rights and liberties, to join in this great European consensus!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during our next sitting we will again approve the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before we do this, let me ask a question which is perhaps not as simple as it appears. Will this be the initial Charter proclaimed in the year 2000 or, as the Leinen report suggests, will it be the adapted rehash integrated within the former draft Constitutional Treaty? The two texts are not, of course, identical and I feel it is unfortunate that their differences are not clearly set out, although that would have raised some legitimate controversy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For example, the French human rights commission expressed, and I quote, its grave concern about the amendments made to the articles on social rights – I am still quoting – that threaten to remove the social content of the Charter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the main authors of the original Charter, the lawyer Guy Braibant, explained in the press – and I quote – that the conditions for applying the text have changed. First of all, the word ‘may’ is occasionally replaced by ‘must’. Moreover – and I am still quoting – there is an official reference to ‘explanations’ by the Presidium. Although they ought to be pedagogical and completely neutral, the explanations interpret laws in a rather minimal sense. Fundamental rights have been undermined, unquote.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Which text will we be approving in the next sitting? I also have a subsidiary question: will this approval be valid in all EU countries? This kind of action cannot entertain any ambiguity. Thus I would appreciate a precise reply to these two questions.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I have been involved in the preparation of the Charter, and in both conventions I have proposed a very simple solution: allow the EU to become a member of the European Convention on Human Rights. In this way, the institutions would be bound in the same way as the countries. We would close a gap. When we make the Charter legally binding, we are not closing any gaps. On the contrary, we are creating a number of gaps in the protection that we enjoy as citizens under our national constitutions and as part of our common European human rights. The Luxembourg Court’s activist interpretation will always take precedence over both Strasbourg and our own Supreme Court. The Charter is unsuitable as an independent source of law. It is much too imprecise. Does the right to life begin at birth? If not, then how many months before? Does the right to take industrial action also apply to public sector employees? Freedom of speech for public servants is much better under the Strasbourg Court than under the Luxembourg Court. In addition, yesterday we saw a textbook example of possible conflicts. The German journalist Hans-Martin Tillack obtained the support of the Strasbourg Court, which stated that OLAF had acted unlawfully when it arrested him and confiscated 16 boxes of documents, computers and telephones. Luxembourg supported the theft of the journalist’s sources. Strasbourg condemned the theft and arrest because it prioritised freedom of the press.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Charter will be presented as a victory for human rights. Possibly. It is more reminiscent of a fake lottery ticket. In a sense we are taking a great risk with regard to hard-earned human rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The drawing of the lottery numbers is decided by judges in Luxembourg outside parliamentary control, and only when they are condemned will there be a unanimous amendment of the treaties to correct any backlash. It is very impractical, and it is more like an imprisonment of our rights than a charter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we all support human rights, and I am growing a little tired of some people – particularly those from states where, historically speaking, human rights are something of a novelty – attacking the UK as some sort of pariah because of its ‘gesture’ opt-out under Protocol 7.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind them that, as long ago as 1688, a bill of rights lay at the heart of the Glorious Revolution in the United Kingdom. Since then, the UK has been a beacon of liberty. So we need no finger-pointing lessons in human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">People might be irked that we have spoilt the party by withholding, for now, from some of the trappings of EU super-statehood, but I would point out that it is our national and political right to do so. Sadly, though, the opt-out will fade out as the European Court of Justice sets about its centralising agenda. Ultimately, though, those people will get their way – should the UK be so foolish as to ratify this Treaty despite the opposition of its people.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President, it is also one of the fundamental rights of citizens not to be overlooked. This Charter of Fundamental Rights does indeed provide protection for citizens akin to that afforded by the classic constitutional state. However, the European Union is not a state. It is not a state, but it does have legislative competence, and it is only this legislative competence of the European Union’s institutions which falls under the protection and control of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on a binding basis. Associated with this is the fact that European legislation and the actions of the European institutions are bound by values and value-based decisions, along with the first sentence of this Charter, which is also the most noble: human dignity is inviolable.</p>
      <p sl="de">I derive this principle from a Christian image of humanity. However, it can be derived from other sources as well. Our binding commitment to this principle, and the binding commitment of our three institutions to adhere to this principle, represents a massive step forward. This applies to the European Union as a whole. Poland and the United Kingdom are rule-of-law states; there is no doubt about that. The fact is, however, that by not signing and by opting out of the Charter, they are not protecting themselves; they are shielding something that is already protected. The fact is that this Charter is not applicable to national legislation and national institutions at all. In other words, they are protecting something that can already be taken as a given. In Poland in particular – where a majority in Parliament and a majority of the people take a different view, but where the President is making use of his prerogatives – I hope that change will come about in time.</p>
      <p sl="de">The legally binding nature of the Charter can be further reinforced if we pursue a harmonised strategy. Mr President-in-Office, I am grateful to you for the fact that we are utilising the opportunity afforded by single legal personality and are acceding to the Strasbourg Convention. If this is successful, the European area of justice will achieve coherence, bringing together the protection of fundamental rights at both national and European level. I hope the outcome will be a value-oriented Europe of citizens of which we can be proud!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the early 21st century counterpart to the great statements on human rights and citizens’ rights made in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Those were famous declarations on freedom and the rule of law that forged contemporary democracy. Our Charter has its roots in events that contributed to the development of democracy and the contemporary system of liberal democracy during the last 200 years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I see no reason why certain European countries should not adopt this Charter. I put it to Mr Szymański, how can one seriously argue against the Charter in a country that was the birthplace of Solidarność , thanks to whose leadership the whole of Europe gained its current understanding of the right to freedom, the rule of law and democracy?</p>
      <p sl="pl">I appeal to the Polish Government in Warsaw, and in particular to Mr Tusk, the Prime Minister. Mr Tusk, your parliamentary group won the elections a month ago thanks to the votes of those Poles who wish the Charter to be included in the European Reform Treaty. I trust you will not disappoint the voters who supported you just over a month ago. I call on the Polish Government to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Reform Treaty, so that it will be binding in my homeland too. The Poland of Solidarność , European Poland, the Poland of tolerance and openness believes that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a key element of the Reform Treaty. We should not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by the conservative right wing, which would like us to agree not to implement this Charter in our homeland.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a sine qua non for any community wishing to operate pursuant to the value system derived from respecting human dignity. This gives rise to the principles of freedom, equality and solidarity. I see no reason why countries such as the United Kingdom or Poland that wish to be part of the Community should refuse to be involved in something that constitutes the foundation of our common action.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This Charter advocates reference to social values, to the European social model. It also states unambiguously that, where local customs and practices are concerned, internal national law applies. This means that there are no grounds for any type of opt-out to apply in this area.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the debate on this report touches on many issues, and indirectly on the basis for creating a new legal framework. In August 2007 the President of this Parliament made a statement in that regard at a gathering of displaced persons. He stated that the source of the right to a homeland should be sought in the right to dignity, and that the right to a homeland is therefore a fundamental human right.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The right to dignity is enshrined in the first article of the Charter. The President’s opinion was criticised in the Polish Parliament. The German association of displaced persons laments the fate of people resettled from Poland. What would happen if the German lament and specific interpretation of human dignity were applied to Alsace and Lorraine? Might a centre for the resettled be set up in this case too, or will there be reconciliation? Attempting to derive the right to a homeland from the right to dignity is a misinterpretation of the axiology of human rights, as stated by Mr Karski, a Member of the Polish Parliament. An interpretation clarifying primary legislation is acceptable, but not its extension.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The President of the European Parliament referred to Pope John Paul II. I should like to remind this House and its President that in 1965 Archbishop Karol Wojtyła published a written declaration according to which German bishops had stated clearly that Germans resettled from the East wished, and indeed had, to understand that a whole new generation of Poles was growing up there, and that these Poles considered the land assigned to their parents to be their own homeland. No legal or moral disquisition or sentimental spokespersons are called for on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I do believe that we can achieve unanimity on the Charter in this House, however, despite President Sarkozy’s recent suggestion that unanimity contradicts democracy. Vain hopes, Mr Sarkozy, since you are unable to convince even the Paris metro workers.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, no one can dispute that the citizens of Europe must be armed with fundamental rights and freedoms, vis-à-vis their own countries as well as the European Union. A Europe without rights and freedoms would cease to be Europe. However, that is not the problem nowadays because the citizens are already sufficiently protected against their national governments both by their own national constitutions and by the European Convention on Human Rights. As regards the European institutions, European citizens can also assert their fundamental freedoms and rights in accordance with the fixed jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. The real point here is that, with the proclamation of this Charter, another step is taken towards a federal Europe. People want a European Bill of Rights just like in the federal United States. The difference between them, though, is that this Charter goes much further than an enumeration of the traditional rights and freedoms. Sometimes, however, it does seem like an enumeration of all kinds of socio-economic promises. The manifest does not tally in the slightest with the cargo.</p>

      <p sl="de">Human rights are our European trade mark both within and outside Europe. Nonetheless, may I advise caution and that we do not get carried away by our emotions and bite off more than we can chew. With the Charter and the necessary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, we are establishing the important and classic basic rights and the important social rights on a legally binding basis, which means that they will be binding for the European institutions and the application of Community law. We are also making it possible to have recourse to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in respect of these basic rights, albeit under certain very narrowly defined conditions. However, this does not mean that every citizen will be able to petition the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg immediately, or indeed at all, as some people – swept away by their emotions – have occasionally claimed. That kind of claim does not serve our interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us stop making these assertions, which overshoot the mark, and let us feel a sense of gratification at the result that we have achieved. In the European Union, we have now set an important course – not only in relation to the classic rights but for our social policy too – of which we can in all conscience be proud. It includes the work/life balance, the prohibition of child labour, health protection for everyone and a high level of environmental and consumer protection. We should be pleased about that; it is the truth, and there is no need to embellish it.</p>

In an intergovernmental conference Members of this Parliament passed an initiative whereby the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council would sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights in a ceremony in Parliament’s plenary on 12 December and it would be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This accords excellently with the values that the Charter of Fundamental Rights represents. A ceremonial signing will also increase the document’s visibility. It therefore goes without saying that we wish to give our President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, a mandate to sign.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I thought you were asking me to make a final speech on the Charter debate, a speech which I do not have prepared, hence the reason for my confusion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of flexicurity is now a key item on the European agenda and is essential for the future of Europe’s economic and social models. It is a complex issue involving the capacity to manage change and promote employment and social security reform in a rapidly changing global context which requires responses to the challenges of global competition, technological innovation and population ageing. We need more flexible markets, but this also means that we must ensure better conditions, better instruments and more security for our citizens so that they can handle this change positively. That is the challenge facing us.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For our part, the Portuguese Presidency has tried to contribute actively to the search for integrated and balanced solutions in this area. Following the Commission communication presented in June, we were responsible for conducting a process aimed at carrying out the European Council mandate and achieving consensus on the common principles of flexicurity. The Commission communication naturally formed an excellent starting point for this work as it helped us to develop the concept and increase discussion of the solutions that could serve as a common platform for the various lines which each Member State will have to follow.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Bearing in mind that the starting points and situations are different, the solutions will also have to differ. In order to create the conditions for progress in this area, we developed various initiatives with the main actors at European level, including a Conference on the challenges of flexicurity. This was politically well-attended and discussed the developments in this respect and also future prospects. We also sought to analyse the experience gained in countries where models have been applied with good results and to identify which elements of these models can be used in other contexts. We also obtained the opinions of expert committees on employment and social welfare and also the Committee of the Regions. In addition we tried to encourage the social partners in this area to become involved as we are aware that this new model requires firm commitment from all the stakeholders, yet it also requires that everyone’s interests be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, the understanding that we reached with the social partners at the Tripartite Social Summit held on 18 October in Lisbon gave important impetus to this debate. Social dialogue at various levels and the involvement of the social partners are decisive in ensuring the success of any strategy to reform the labour markets. The involvement of everyone in this process is key to finding successful solutions and we need a climate of trust between social partners and with the institutions. We all have to be prepared to accept and take responsibility for the change. I want to highlight the quality of the debate and interventions at all stages, both in technical and academic terms and also in terms of the discussion on the political content and on the process.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a result of all this work that I have mentioned, during which we were always able to count on the assistance of the Commission, the Council is now able to endorse a set of common principles on flexicurity which we hope to formally adopt at the meeting on 5 and 6 December. These common principles on which we are all agreed include, in particular, taking account of the diversity of national situations which will require different approaches and solutions, the need to overcome labour market segmentation, the various dimensions of flexicurity – labour legislation, education, training, social welfare – recognising the relevance of social dialogue in this context, promoting social inclusion, non-discrimination, equality and reconciliation of work and family life, and also defending the need to ensure the compatibility of policies with the solidity and sustainability of public finances. I want to stress that, in essence, there is broad agreement with this House. I must underline the excellent work that we have done and that this House has done in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Once adopted, the common principles shall form an essential instrument for implementing the next cycle of the Lisbon Strategy. The Member States will be invited to take account of these principles when defining and implementing their national policies, by developing their own mechanisms and approaches depending on their specific situations which will be monitored in the framework of national reform programmes. Social partners at all levels will also be encouraged to help define and implement the flexicurity measures and also to use the common principles as a reference. We feel it is essential to invest in the social mobilisation of our citizens within this strategy and, in this context, I must mention the vital importance of this House’s involvement. Given who it represents politically and its proximity to the people, this House can make an excellent contribution to ensuring better understanding of the flexicurity concept. The key principle is that flexibility and security must be seen as mutually supporting and reinforcing elements, rather than as opposing elements, and this must be fully understood by our citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="3-066" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the Commission’s communication on flexicurity has triggered an important and useful discussion throughout the Union. I thank the rapporteur, Mr Christensen, and the other Members who have taken an active part in discussing flexicurity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Thanks to your efforts and cooperation with the other parliamentary committees, the European Parliament will be able to adopt a resolution that will significantly support the approach that the Commission has proposed. In our society, security depends on change. Now we must coordinate ways to seek new forms of security: better skills, the ability to find new jobs, modern protective measures adapted to the new labour market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In recent years, for every job that has been lost in Europe in the industrial sector, four new jobs have been created in other sectors. The most important question is how to gain control over these shifts and how to manage this change successfully. We must also pose the question of the reasons for labour market segregation in a number of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I very much welcome the report that you are considering today. This report recognises that flexicurity can be a strategy for labour market reform. The text also supports the four-part policy structure formulated for flexicurity by the Commission. I can also fully support the proposal relating to common principles mentioned in paragraph 15 of this report. Your proposals take approximately the same direction as the proposals made by the Commission in its own communication. I understand your desire for some issues, such as measures to combat insecurity, to be explained more precisely. However, I believe that the principles must be concise and that they must be viewed from the standpoint of the whole communication.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to welcome the European social partners’ agreement with the analysis of labour market problems; their analysis was presented at the recent Tripartite Social Summit in Lisbon on 18 October 2007 and, among other things, also looked at flexicurity. This agreement indicates that social dialogue can bring concrete results. Indeed, you have referred to this joint analysis in your motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Now I would like to reply to some of the critical views expressed in your report. I know you go on to say that discussion about flexicurity should be more balanced. First of all I would like to remind you that the Commission’s communication is the result of intensive dialogue between all the stakeholders and careful consultation with leading specialists in this field. I am convinced that the Commission’s approach is balanced, since the objective is to support flexibility and security simultaneously and, as has already been said, as two elements that are synergetic and in no way inconsistent.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is obvious that discussion of flexicurity must not be misused to move towards labour market deregulation. On the contrary, flexibility and mobility must aim higher: that is, towards better jobs, towards a better balance between work and family and private life, a more efficient economy as a whole. As you know, in the next few weeks the Council will make a decision on common principles of flexicurity. After that, national discussions scheduled by all the stakeholders will continue, making it possible to pursue flexicurity strategies at the national level with regard to the specific features of individual states. I am confident that the individual stakeholders will ensure that a balanced approach can be achieved in the area of flexicurity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As far as costs are concerned, it should be appreciated that the costs connected with a flexicurity policy are much lower than the concrete benefits in terms of a more dynamic labour market and reduced unemployment. Moreover, in a number of instances, it will mean no increase in financial costs, but more efficient use of available resources instead.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to react to the paragraph of the report in which it is stated that the open-ended contract should form the basis of a social security system. The Commission’s intention is in no way to reduce the importance of the open-ended contract. However, I believe that we should adopt more general systems of social security, which would apply both to open-ended contracts and to part-time employment: in short, the intention is that these forms of employment should also be provided with adequate social security cover, not that open-ended contracts should be weakened.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I believe that, with the exception of these few reservations, the report is a useful, relevant contribution to the discussion about flexicurity, and once again I would like to thank the European Parliament for it.</p>

    <intervention id="3-067" speaker_id="28154" name="Ole CHRISTENSEN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Denmark" birth_date="07-05-1955" birth_place="Pandrup" p_group="Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament" m_state="DK">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to stand here today as rapporteur. The negotiations in Parliament have been completed, and we can present a balanced report that reflects attitudes across the entire political spectrum. The whole concept behind these guidelines on flexicurity is to tackle the challenges faced by the labour markets of Europe. Note that I use the plural, ‘labour markets’, because the report recognises that there is no ‘one size fits all’ as far as flexicurity is concerned. Although there is no common model for flexicurity, we must recognise that Europe faces many common challenges in its labour markets that require a joint response. The demographic challenges mean that in 2050 there will be 1.5 employees for every pensioner. Currently, the figure is 3 employees per pensioner. Around 100 million Europeans are living in or on the threshold of poverty. The effects of inequality can be seen all too easily when you compare countries where there are major differences, such as those in Eastern and Western Europe. However, they can also be seen internally in countries where we are witnessing increasing inequality. Six percent of employees in Europe can be characterised as ‘working poor’ and a growing number are experiencing poorer working conditions with uncertain employment circumstances and very poor working conditions. Short-term contracts and temporary work are on the increase, and the ordinary open-ended employment contract is under threat. Such precarious employment amounts to 12% in Europe. In addition, undeclared and unlawful employment is increasing. In some countries, unlawful employment accounts for almost 15% of all employment. This development is something that we must turn around, partly because it is expensive for Europe and partly because these uncertain and unstable employment circumstances often affect the weaker groups in society.</p>
      <p sl="da">Education is Europe’s most important raw material in the competitive global market, but it is not being given enough attention. In fact, 15% of our young people are leaving the education system too soon, at a time when the labour market is placing major demands upon knowledge. Those who do not jump on the education bandwagon will experience difficulties in the long term, and we therefore have an obligation to help such people.</p>
      <p sl="da">Thus, the challenges are clear to Europe. Our responsibility is to deliver a message and a vision of how we will tackle these challenges. In this connection I would like to thank the Commission for its excellent contribution. We have enjoyed good cooperation in connection with the report, in which my role has naturally been to gather up the loose ends here in this House. My perception as rapporteur is that there is a need for a stronger focus on the social Europe, to ensure that workers’ rights are respected throughout the EU and for us to have more and better jobs. Greater flexibility within organisations must not come about at the expense of employees’ working conditions. How can we ensure this? The report specifically emphasises the need for the open-ended employment contract to become the standard contract type in Europe. Secondly, we must ensure that social partners are involved to a greater extent. That decisions cannot be taken above the heads of employees lies at the heart of a flexible and secure labour market. The inclusion of employees is absolutely essential, and this cannot be emphasised enough in the implementation of flexicurity strategies.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, the report is concerned with what we might call the framework for flexicurity. In other words, the national terms and conditions for implementing flexibility and security. Flexibility and flexicurity cost money. However, it is not wasted money; it is by contrast money that is invested and produces a bonus. For example, if you invest in your workforce, it might perhaps be an expense in the short term, but experience has shown that it will pay dividends in the longer term. Therefore, flexicurity as we understand the concept in Northern Europe requires a welfare state of a certain calibre and size. In this connection we must be honest and say that the developments that we are witnessing in some countries, where there is competition for lower and lower taxes, will make it very difficult to finance the security aspect of flexicurity. Therefore, I will attempt once and for all to silence all the voices that claim that flexicurity is a neo-liberal concept aimed at undermining the rights of employees. This is not the case; on the contrary.</p>
      <p sl="da">In conclusion, I hope that, through this debate here in this House and around Europe, we will be able to dispel some of the myths that abound in connection with flexicurity. As rapporteur, I have, with considerable help from my colleagues, been able to draw up some balanced guidelines for flexicurity, guidelines that show how Europe should develop its labour market in the future in order to make it both competitive and social. With such a strategy, we will also discover how to tackle the uncertainty that exists amongst employees in Europe. Many are currently afraid that their jobs will be relocated and that their place in the labour market will become superfluous.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur, the rapporteurs from the other committees and everyone else who has otherwise contributed to this report. I will conclude by expressing the hope that the Heads of State or Government will incorporate Parliament’s recommendations in their further work towards achieving the common guidelines for flexicurity when they meet in Portugal in December.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for a job well done. The changes which globalisation engenders offer new and better opportunities for all the world’s countries but, of course, they also pose challenges. Europe stands at a crossroads. We can choose to welcome the new and flexible economy and its possibilities or retreat into protectionism in various forms.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Flexicurity is one of the most important tools for the creation of a labour market which, as the rapporteur says, fully utilises the potential of the labour force. Training, mobility and employability are keywords. Clearly no single model is universally applicable, but we can and should learn from one another. We make the point in the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that protection systems which are too rigid may indeed protect those who are on the inside, but they can make it difficult for others to enter the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Population growth in Europe is a problem too, which the rapporteur also pointed out. More people will need jobs. Flexicurity, when used correctly, is a good model for Europe to continue to develop positively in a global economy. The example of Denmark, which the rapporteur did not mention, I think shows this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, there is one thing at least that we should agree on in this House, namely that too many are without jobs today. Europe must continue to grow so that new jobs can be created.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Christensen’s report has been crucial in taking forward the initial document.</p>
      <p sl="it">These principles are potentially very valuable, but only if at the same time there are safeguards for all at-risk groups – immigrants, women, the elderly and the disabled – as well as for adults who have a low level of education and are more vulnerable and less well protected.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, the inequalities in our society are becoming ever more widespread, such as the lack of a minimum wage – which must be adopted in all countries – and the need to recognise workers’ rights. The knowledge base of workers must likewise be raised. Allocating economic funding for the implementation of these principles and identifying genuine resources is also a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, it seems to me that in recent years there have been many new sources of imbalance in the relations between capital and labour: profits and financial speculation have gained the upper hand while wages have fallen. Addressing this imbalance is one of the tasks we must take on together in carrying these issues forward.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the so-called flexicurity model is unlikely to be effective in the European labour market unless it is accompanied by other actions and proposals aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and making it easier to set up businesses. I have in mind, for example, the work on drawing up a statute for the European private company.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Regarding the common principles for implementing flexicurity, I should like to emphasise that the introduction of complex legislative solutions at European level in this area runs counter to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Social and employment policy falls within the competences of the Member States, and any European Union action in the area of flexicurity must comply with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the EU Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, the internal complexity of the model is not favourable to the introduction of Community legislative standards and to a so-called one size fits all approach to the matter. The outcome of the impact assessment indicates that open coordination may be the most appropriate method. This is particularly important for the new Member States which may be confronted with different structural problems in the area of employment in view of the legacy of their past. The high short-term costs associated with the introduction of paths towards implementation of the flexicurity model must also be borne in mind, together with the significant burden on budgets.</p>

Mamede de Infesta" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats" m_state="PT">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reforms that the European Union must carry out in order to secure a competitive position in the world economy cannot be seen purely as limited public sector initiatives but as also requiring changes in behaviour and attitudes on the part of both workers and companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These changes can only be successfully achieved if there is a climate of trust between social partners, and this can only be developed by promoting social dialogue. As regards managing the labour market, we must switch from a mindset dominated by the culture of conflict to a new approach based on the culture of cooperation. Personally I do not like the term ‘flexicurity’. I would prefer to talk about ‘change with security’ because any change involves risks. The important point is to minimise those risks. People cannot be asked to be flexible when they have no confidence either in themselves or in the world around them. We therefore constantly stress in this report the need for active employment policies and lifelong learning systems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The PPE-DE Group tabled 120 amendments to the initial report and, following a process of negotiation, we have arrived at a final version which I believe is balanced and comprehensive. A good balance has been achieved between the concepts of flexibility and security and also between the interests of all the stakeholders in the process, in particular social partners and public authorities. The report clearly refers to the need to apply principles of subsidiarity and proportionality when implementing and managing flexicurity. I therefore recommend that this report be adopted by the House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I offer many congratulations to the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have four points, the first of which is to the Commission. First in its Green Paper on labour law and now in its communication on flexicurity, it puts the emphasis on employment security rather than job security. We put the emphasis on both and that is because we recognise the needs of flexible firms. A flexible firm is one that needs to change a production line every six months or IT configuration every four months and that needs an adaptable, well-qualified, loyal workforce – and you do not get that at all from a fragmented, segmented, casualised labour force.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, flexicurity needs a whole range of factors in place to work properly: a good, stable macroeconomic climate, investment in good, active labour market policies, well-developed social dialogue and high-quality policies for social protection. All these elements are important, and one thing is clear: they do not come cheap. The Commission therefore has to recognise that flexicurity can only be put in place in some Member States over a considerable period of time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, a balanced form of flexicurity needs to be built around the principles included in paragraph 15 of this report, and those principles need to be incorporated into an amended guideline package. They need to be given visibility and they need to be applied. Otherwise, all of the good work included in this excellent report will have been for nothing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, both the Council and the Commission talk endlessly about the importance of flexicurity, but how can the Council be taken seriously while the directive on temporary agency work remains blocked? How can the other institutions be taken seriously while exploitative forms of atypical work continue to proliferate in all of our Member States? For too many millions of our workforce, flexicurity is all about flexibility and nothing to do with security. This report sets out ways in which that can change.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we wish to support the Commission in its bid to encourage collective reflection on flexicurity. The EU must be behind dialogue among all players in this area. Our Group is also pleased that, for the first time in Europe, the social partners have reached an agreement in a common document to ask the Member States to implement flexicurity policies. This is most important, since flexicurity only makes sense if it ushers in an atmosphere of trust between employees and employers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the elected representatives of EU citizens, we have a special responsibility to create the conditions for this kind of trust. It is in everyone’s interest to play the game, and above all we must not allow ourselves to be tempted to oppose flexibility, which would be to the benefit of employers, and security, which would constitute compensation for employees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Implementing flexicurity means simultaneously guaranteeing flexibility and security for employees and employers. Employees need flexibility to reconcile their professional lives and their personal lives, or to pursue their professional lives along new paths. Employers need security just as much as employees, particularly legal security in their contractual relations with personnel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report is a step in the right direction. It is balanced and proposes a framework for Member States to adopt common principles. I wish to thank and congratulate the rapporteur on his work. The Member States must not be forced to impose one particular vision of flexicurity. The job markets in each Member State obviously have some extremely different characteristics. We are looking at the coordination of employment policies, not premature harmonisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our fellow citizens, however, wish to see a Europe that provides solutions to the challenges of globalisation. By protecting professional options, facilitating the adaptation of employees, accepting and accompanying life’s sudden twists, flexicurity can form a unique way to modernise our social models. Let us not miss out on the chance of us all agreeing to work towards a common objective.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the movement towards more flexible forms of employment developed at a time of very high unemployment, when it was relatively easy to force a worker to accept worse employment conditions in order to stay in a job at all. When workers lacked the means with which to provide for their own and their family’s basic needs, they were prepared even to tolerate being humiliated at the workplace. They were also prepared to agree to not being insured against accidents and to work illegally for starvation wages.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fortunately, the situation in the labour market is now changing. Most Polish employers undervalued the importance of permanent employment. As a result, they are now short of workers, and Poland has witnessed the emigration of almost two million young people, many of whom are highly educated. Flexible employment that does not recognise the importance of job security brings short-term benefits to employers at the expense of workers. I am glad that the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution attaches more importance to the need for job security than the European Commission. I should like to point out that research undertaken by the International Labour Organization confirms that workers with permanent contracts are more effective.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about flexicurity shows that it is not possible to transfer a given social model from one Member State directly to the EU as a whole. Nor does this seem to be what the Commission wants. Its document is not about improving the social security of workers in light of radically changing labour market conditions; no, the Commission wants to push flexibility of employment relations without actually being in a position to improve social security for workers: that falls within the competence of the Member States where there are many different notions of just how important it is.</p>
      <p sl="de">What’s more, the key role and the control function performed by the trade unions – which in Denmark are an essential element of the flexicurity model – cannot be taken as a given in other Member States at present, or indeed at any time in the near future. In some governments, too, where flexicurity is interpreted and championed solely as flexibility, trade union rights are being further curtailed at the same time. We Greens are critical of efforts to use flexicurity as a vehicle by which to introduce the deregulation of labour law throughout the EU, thereby achieving global competitiveness for the European Union at the expense of workers’ rights. Unfortunately, the coalition in this House is following the Commission’s lead and is missing out on the opportunity to introduce a core element – namely social security – as an equally important component into the flexicurity model.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wonder how the Socialists intend to explain this to workers. My concern is that we will be missing out on the opportunities for a future debate about the benefits that are undoubtedly inherent in the flexicurity model as well. We therefore need to amend the report, or we will be unable to support it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, flexicurity is nothing new. It is an old Danish model, dating right back to the late 19th century, whereby security not enshrined in contracts of employment is guaranteed by the government, at great cost.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is new in this Europe of ours is terrible insecurity, which affects young people at work but damages society as a whole. In order to combat this insecurity we must change tack and dispense with the laissez-faire methods and ideologies which brought it about. It is not true that insecurity creates jobs and economic growth; the opposite is true. Now, with flexicurity, we are experimenting with a new ideology, but one that preserves the old model of insecurity intact.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, my Group has fought for some very practical ideas: against the idea of a labour market rigidity indicator and in favour of a good employment indicator, so as to emphasise that stable, secure employment is the norm; against unjustified dismissal, in that it amounts to discrimination; against a recurring accumulation of atypical contracts, or lifelong insecurity, which is a modern form of slavery; in favour of the right of those not in employment to an income, as they cannot live on air alone; in favour of bringing together different forms of welfare assistance; and against discrimination affecting women at work.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact that no resources have been earmarked to guarantee flexicurity – there has been a 2% cut – and consequently that no reliable investment is possible, speaks volumes about the risk of this operation turning into nothing but hot air.</p>
      <p sl="it">Workers and young people are calling for something tangible, not for outdated ideologies. These are the points that we have fought for in this House and would like to see voted through.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality was very nearly overlooked in this debate, but fortunately at the last minute it has been able to take its turn.</p>
      <p sl="nl">More than half of Europe’s population is female and, at the moment, these women are usually over-represented in the labour market as regards temporary and part-time contracts. Women therefore already have to deal with more uncertainty, poor accrual of pensions and inadequate medical expenses. When those such as the Commission and the Dutch Government want to make redundancy rights even more flexible, this group will only sink further into oppression and lack of rights. I was therefore overjoyed when the Committee on Women’s Rights unanimously made a series of proposals for improving the Commission’s proposal on this point. Unfortunately the rapporteur has chosen to adopt very few of these broad and elevated proposals. In so doing he has dishonoured the Committee on Women’s Rights and ignored the very real inequalities that exist. I therefore call on all Members to support, in tomorrow’s vote, the amendments which have been tabled to prevent this inequality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, fewer and fewer people are spending their entire working life with the same employer, so they need to be able to adapt without any problems to changing living and working conditions. At the same time, people must have adequate employment security. Commissioner Spidla, only if flexibility and security are brought into equilibrium will the new flexicurity concept become widely accepted. On the one hand, there must be more flexibility for companies so that they can identify market niches and become more innovative and plan their development proactively rather than just reacting to events. On the other hand, workers in the Member States need the security afforded by modern systems of social protection and reliable agreements between responsible social partners. The right framework conditions must also be put in place for more permanent jobs and easier transitions to new jobs. The abuse of new forms of employment must also be prevented, along with bogus self-employment and undeclared work.</p>
      <p sl="de">A further priority is lifelong learning which is essential to make our workers fit for globalisation. Agreeing a benchmark of 2% of GDP on a binding basis is unacceptable, in my view, for we have to leave the Member States some financial latitude here. However, governments and businesses must ensure that far more is invested in our most important resource, namely well-educated people who are highly skilled, motivated and adaptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">The PPE-DE Group has again tabled various amendments at my initiative. In one of these amendments, we say that companies must be able to decide for themselves on how they approach the issue of corporate social responsibility. CSR must continue to be based on a voluntary, not an obligatory system.</p>
      <p sl="de">As my final point, let me say that bringing forward the date for lifting the transitional measures obstructing the free movement of workers from 2013 to 2009 sends out the wrong signal. In areas where far higher hourly wages are paid with a high level of social security, the pressure from migration is intense and difficult to manage. Here too, security must not be neglected, notwithstanding the flexibility that is undoubtedly necessary.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for a job well done and an excellent report. Like José Albino Silva Peneda, I prefer to speak of ‘change with security’, change which we encounter in the form of globalisation and in the form of demographic growth. I think that is a better way of putting it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There is a difference between the Commission’s proposal and Parliament’s proposal, namely on the point of where the focus lies in the changes. We have a different focus in Parliament’s proposal. The Commission’s focus is on employment security rather than job security. There should be no such distinction. What is needed is to combine the security of being able to get a new job with a high level of security in employment. In Parliament we try to focus on participation in the process, strong trade unions and a strong social dialogue. We focus on an active employment policy, we focus on more investment in training and we focus on strong social security systems.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many have said that there is no single model but that all must proceed on the basis of their own concepts. The Lisbon process is applicable. Now, when principles are to be established, I would endorse what Stephen Hughes said: look at paragraph 15, see what principles should form the guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally I would say to Elisabeth Schroedter that it is not the case that the rapporteur had no contact with the European trade union movement. There were close contacts throughout the period, and they fully support us in seeking to change the focus. To refrain from forming views before the employment ministers do so would mean handing over to them the sole right to decide. Parliament must have a line …</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
      <p sl="et">The European Union does not need only to reform its own institutions quickly, but must also provide its citizens and businesses with a policy which alleviates the side-effects of intense competition and the opening up of the market.</p>
      <p sl="et">I regard it as important to encourage stable employment relations in which there is a high level of confidence. Any success in changes to labour law would be greater if employees felt more secure. We must also bear in mind the fact that a feeling of security often also depends on how easy it is to find a new job.</p>
      <p sl="et">I am of the view that the biggest problems in the European Union relate to the provision of a flexible, qualified workforce, and therefore that this issue should be at the heart of Europe’s flexicurity strategy.</p>
      <p sl="et">The most important thing must be to create a flexible labour market by raising the level of education through training and re-training programmes.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, flexicurity is neither a panacea nor a taboo subject. We just have to agree on the rules of the game. It goes without saying that Europe must be equal to the challenges of globalisation and competition – not always fair competition – forced upon us by the world economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">All of this requires flexibility, but that does not mean turning our backs on the European social model, its values, its standards of security and above all its solidarity. Flexibility is therefore acceptable on condition that there are firm rules, guarantees and compensatory mechanisms in place.</p>
      <p sl="it">Most importantly, Europe must lead the Member States in a strategy comprising certain key ingredients: a decent level of continuing training, adequate welfare measures, quality services beginning with childcare services, and social security systems to support workers during periods of inactivity. Such support, incidentally, need not necessarily take the form of handouts; it could also be the provision of opportunities to acquire the skills required for new jobs on offer.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, there must be measures for reconciling work and family life, to enable women in particular to enjoy truly equal opportunities in the world of work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Naturally, these objectives necessitate a substantial amount of funding, but only in this way can flexicurity be an opportunity rather than a shortcut towards deregulation of the world of work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to the rapporteur for his work, especially as it was completed in such a short space of time.</p>
      <p sl="it">I too believe that a word is just a word. Flexicurity in itself is neither a good nor a bad policy. Nor is it just one policy: it is a set of combined and well-balanced actions. Everything depends on how those actions are designed and put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="it">Flexicurity is customarily believed to be a strategy aimed at making the labour market more flexible and rewarding the move from one job to another by means of economic support and training. This amounts to a defensive attitude, to damage limitation, whereas what we need is a fresh approach, innovation and quality.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we try to look at flexicurity from a female point of view, we obtain a useful perspective on the matter. After all, it enables us to see that the majority of the most insecure and unstable jobs are geared towards women. At the same time, moreover, we can detect the full positive potential of such a strategy if we understand flexibility not as insecurity but as flexible organisation of employment and work schedules to meet the needs of employees.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we understand security not just as training allowances but also as assistance with the various activities and decisions occurring during a person’s lifetime, then we will break new ground and make forward-looking proposals, rather than harking back to the ways of the past.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief. The work of this House will continue after this debate so I must say to you that it is this Presidency’s or rather our Presidency’s belief that this is of course an important and necessary debate. This can be seen from the level of participation and from the high number of Members who wanted to participate and cooperate in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Flexibility naturally means mobility and, in a globalised world, the word ‘mobility’ is necessary and signifies adaptation to change. However, we are not only talking about mobility; we are also talking about security. This means committing to people, to workers, to their qualifications and training, and also to family protection and protection of the quality of work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are of course confident that the main guidelines that we have managed to agree with our social partners will in practice allow the necessary measures to be developed and established so that change and security can be ensured and so that Europe is better able to successfully tackle the challenges facing us as a result of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At its meeting on 5 and 6 December, the Council will hopefully adopt these guidelines. I am certain that in the future these will prove to be the right guidelines and the right bases for a policy that will make Europe stronger and more competitive.</p>

The distinctive nature of different models is recognised. However, I would like to suggest that states which implement the principles referred to have a better labour market situation, and here we are not just talking about the Scandinavian countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The other issue I would like to mention is the question of costs. Again, you can see that a typical example, which has often been cited, is Denmark, whose social protection and health care expenditures are not above average in the European context. This should always be pointed out.</p>

      <p sl="de">In one of the amendments tabled on this report, an attempt is made to secure the European Parliament’s support for European minimum wages. In my view, this approach is fundamentally wrong. The conditions and parameters in place in the individual regional labour markets are so disparate that a European approach will not enable us to increase prosperity for citizens; instead, we would be entrenching poverty, unemployment and black-market work.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also a call for minimum wages to be set at no less than 50-60% of the average national wage. Which country in Europe has such a high minimum wage? Before tabling this type of amendment for debate, its initiators should at least make the effort to look at the reality in Europe. An attempt is being made here to champion a European wage-setting policy which would increase existing national minimum wages by an average of 20%. This is blatant populism!</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that a clear majority will emerge in Parliament to quash these dangerously utopian ideas, which would merely increase joblessness and poverty and put Europe’s economic competitiveness at risk.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We regret that the report does not oppose, with sufficient clarity, the strategy of flexicurity defended by the European Commission. It limits itself to proposing some palliative care for the principles set out in the Commission communication.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a result, we not only voted against this report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but we also insisted on tabling proposals which rejected the flexicurity approach adopted in that communication. We did this because this approach aims to deregulate the labour markets and labour legislation which will result, in practice, in the destruction of current contractual arrangements, in the liberalisation of unjustified dismissals and in increased insecurity for workers in general.</p>
      <p sl="pt">No palliative care can withstand the constant weakening of collective bargaining, the devaluation of the trade unions and the transformation of permanent contracts into temporary contracts on the pretext of capitalist globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the huge demonstration that took place on 18 October in Lisbon, arranged by the CGTP (General Confederation of Portuguese Workers), Portuguese workers said no to these proposals. What they want is more employment with rights which presupposes a commitment to production, more investment in high-quality public services and respect for the dignity of workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore insist on the proposals that we tabled. If these continue to be rejected, then we will vote against this report given that we reject flexicurity.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The report raises for discussion an essential European issue: the European Union actions towards integration into the labour market cannot ignore the arbitrary restriction of the free movement of workers. Eight of the countries that joined the EU in 2004 – together with Romania and Bulgaria – have transitory periods of at least two years, which can reach seven years.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Starting with the second year of transition, the European institutions become actively involved in the process of authorizing the transition periods imposed by the Member States. For this reason, I request that the European Council examine very carefully, in December, the issue of the free movement restriction in the European Union for the new Member States and that it adopts a mandatory common position to reduce at a minimum the barriers to free movement of labour.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The issue of the restriction of access to the labour market is directly related to the first principle suggested by the rapporteur, namely “European action against abusive practices in various types of non-standard contracts”. As a Member of the European Parliament, I have received numerous complaints from Romanian citizens who are abusively deprived of payment for their work and of the most elementary conditions of social and health insurance in the countries where they carry out their activity. The regulations we will adopt based upon the concept of flexicurity should primarily eliminate such situations.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
      <p sl="unknown">¡Bienvenido al Parlamento Europeo, señor Rodríguez Zapatero! Es un gran placer contar con su presencia.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for accepting the European Parliament’s invitation to attend this debate on the future of Europe, a debate which is a very significant one for this House. Several Prime Ministers from around the European Union have already visited us to discuss the issues that are important for the future of the Union, including Guy Verhofstadt, Romano Prodi and Jan Peter Balkenende. We have had an opportunity to listen to their views and debate matters with them, even at times when there was great uncertainty about the future course of the European Union. Today, we are here in order to listen to you. Based on a decision by the Conference of Presidents – the chairmen of the political groups – this form of debate will conclude with a speech by the Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Prime Minister, I think it is important to mention that Spain was the first country, in 2005, to hold a referendum on what was then the draft Constitutional Treaty, and 77% of Spaniards voted in favour of this draft.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">It is therefore a particular pleasure to be able to welcome you, Prime Minister, here today, shortly before the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon which comes after a long period of reflection and, indeed, crisis: a Treaty into which the substance of the Constitutional Treaty could be incorporated.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Spain is an important country within the European Union and has long made a valuable contribution to the European Union, not only since its accession in 1986 but long before then. Spain has always demonstrated – and this applies to all the major parties – that it is a country with deeply held European convictions, a country which takes the initiative and is willing to show active commitment to the shared future of our continent.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
      <p sl="es">As a committed and active pro-European and as Prime Minister of a deeply pro-European country, it is a matter of great pride to me to appear today before this Parliament, the most representative House of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Here the rich variety of our nations comes together. Here we express our identities, starting from diversity to arrive at what unites us. If there is one institution that emphatically embodies the soul of our project, then it is this House as it is here that the direct wishes of our European citizens are heard.</p>
      <p sl="es">This House has gradually become more solid and better equipped and now comfortably accommodates the vast European family. However, it has also become stronger and more demanding because, as its representativeness has grown, so too has its capacity, first to guide and then to control all our policies and actions.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are therefore, ladies and gentlemen, in exactly the right place to discuss the Europe we want to see and the Europe we need. I must therefore thank you for giving me this opportunity to set out my thoughts and proposals on the present and future of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The concept of Europe is associated by Spaniards with our desire for peace, freedom, democracy and prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our best traditions connect with the values with which we identify the European cultural and political space.</p>
      <p sl="es">For many years we kept alive the hope of us joining this process started more than 50 years ago.</p>
      <p sl="es">The success enjoyed by Spain in the last two decades stems to a large extent from the social dynamism created by our membership of the Union and from our effective use of the means placed at our disposal by the solidarity of the members who preceded us in this project.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Spaniards, we owe a great deal to Europe and we initially joined this project with a profound sense of gratitude which I want to reiterate today before the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">No one can be surprised then that we approved the Constitutional Treaty in a referendum. Likewise, no one can be surprised that we exercised all our goodwill and flexibility to overcome the institutional crisis, at the same time as remaining firm, coherent and tenacious in terms of preserving the basic content, without which the project itself would have been devalued.</p>
      <p sl="es">We overcame the danger but we still have a challenge before us: the challenge of building the Europe that we need and that the world in the 21st century needs.</p>
      <p sl="es">We want a Europe of values. The European identity has been forged over a long history darkened by tragedy, but also illuminated by humankind’s most noble creations, by the light of thought, the warmth and creativity of our artists, the deep convictions of our statesmen and women and the courage of our people.</p>
      <p sl="es">Freedom, the rule of law, human rights, tolerance, gender equality, solidarity, all these form the moral code of Europe. It is here, in adhering to these values and not simply to a geographical space, that the true essence of our Union lies.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Our Europe must have real political substance. Only in this way can we build a Union in line with our ambitions.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we want to achieve this Europe, it necessarily has to be effective. It has to be a Union capable of tackling the challenges of our time head on.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe’s source of legitimacy and its ultimate destination are its people. Among the world’s citizens, we Europeans enjoy the most rights and are the best protected. However, we are not a island and we cannot live happily knowing that these rights do not exist or are being violated in other parts of the world. We have a moral duty to ensure that everyone can enjoy these rights. It is this moral duty that gives Europe a mission in the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">This Europe of values with effective political substance, backed by its people, is also the Europe we need. In a changing and ever more complex world, we must pursue integration. If we give way to isolationism, a narrow view of our borders and the primacy of national interests, we will inevitably become powerless and irrelevant.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is now time to join forces and rekindle our enthusiasm. We were hearing with increasing frequency that Europe was in crisis, that it doubted itself, that its people felt remote from its project or that enlargement was going to dilute the determination of the political Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">I did not share this pessimistic view. We have experienced these difficult situations before and we have always come out stronger on the other side. Jean Monnet said that people only accept change when they are faced with necessity and only recognise necessity when a crisis is upon them. Forced by necessity, we have made changes which will be very fruitful.</p>
      <p sl="es">I highly value the process that has led us to the approval of the new Treaty. It has not been easy. We are developing a brand new model in the history of political civilisation and are gradually making progress on the concrete realities that Schuman talked about. It is quite logical that on occasions we might need more time to take decisions. Yet we are already seeing the fruits of our labour.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is only fair to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution of this Parliament. For Spain, which has fought to maintain the pro-European sense and the balance of the Treaty, the support of this House has been encouraging and decisive.</p>
      <p sl="es">During the negotiations, Europe has kept moving forward. We will soon have the new instruments provided for in the Treaty, together with the important expansion of the range of issues on which a decision can be taken by qualified majority, in order to find solutions to the concerns of our people.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now more than ever, Europe must be a beacon of progress and welfare. We can no longer delay opening up and modernising our economies. We must endeavour to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. This must be our principal and immediate point of reference for tackling the demands of globalisation in its dual external and internal dimensions.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must be ambitious. Experience has taught us that, when we are, we tend to do well. The extraordinary impact of the introduction of the euro, which is now being extended to new Member States, clearly shows us the potential possibilities if we continue to increase our integration. We must finish developing the internal market in goods, services and networks and we must strengthen the institutions responsible for monitoring competition to ensure its proper functioning.</p>
      <p sl="es">In its external dimension, Europe must play a leading role in developing fair rules for globalisation. We must increase the transparency and openness of our markets and support those markets of our non-Community partners in a context of fair competition. We must drive forward the Doha Round. We must set an example in the promotion of international trade.</p>
      <p sl="es">The globalised world requires us to make a special effort in technical innovation and research, to take maximum advantage of the extraordinary potential of our scientists and universities and to combine excellence with territorial cohesion. Our model of effective integration means that all Member States should have equal access to new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="es">We want to make progress in social welfare. Ours is a social Europe, a Europe of social rights.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Our economic model is inconceivable without fairness, and fairness cannot be achieved without protection. Our success must be measured by our capacity to keep growing while ensuring solidarity and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must promote stable and dignified employment, help our workers adapt to changes in the productive system and be champions of policies of social inclusion, equal opportunities, safety at work and health guarantees for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">This new, ever larger Europe will only be successful if we reinforce solidarity among all the Member States. Cohesion is a fundamental principle, particularly due to the commitment that we have all entered into and due to the need to create decisive ties to ensure the political integration of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain, which has benefited greatly from Community solidarity, is in favour of the new Member States also being able to enjoy this benefit and is willing to share its experiences so that they can make good use of this solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe is now immersed in a process of great strategic import: the creation of a common area of freedom, security and justice, the development of the Schengen Area and the system of external borders. There can be no better evidence of our mutual trust than the pooling of security for which those Member States with an external border have assumed particular responsibility. Spain has always been at the forefront of these initiatives and will continue to support them with the utmost determination.</p>
      <p sl="es">I want to underline the importance of reinforcing European immigration policy. Immigration is a reality which has already had an impact on the European agenda; this impact will become even greater as it affects certain very sensitive aspects of our project.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must start by unequivocally acknowledging the positive potential of immigration, which ranges from population support to the invigoration of cultural diversity, not forgetting the potential boost to our economies which has been very clear in the case of Spain.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must favour integration policies that respect rights and require obligations. A Europe that ensures this integration will be more worthy, more free and more secure.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time we must act on the causes behind migration. We should do this through dialogue and effective cooperation with the countries of origin and transit.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must reinforce solidarity among the Member States and equip ourselves with the appropriate resources to effectively control the external borders. Spain has developed measures which are being successfully applied, but much remains to be done. We must strengthen the European Border Management Agency, improve our cooperation on the ground and put out of action those mafias which take advantage of the vital and urgent need of these men and women to escape from their lives of misery and frustration.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">We are faced with the major challenge of preventing and combating terrorism and organised crime. We must be more ambitious in our police and judicial cooperation. Spain, as a result of its own painful experiences, knows only too well the vital need for joint action and will always be at the forefront of this policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Through new initiatives and by leading by example, Europe must seek to develop multilateral responses to global problems. We are already doing this in the fight against climate change, with our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by the year 2020. We can and must lead the way, establish Europe as a reference and encourage a new consensus in the negotiations that will start in Bali in December.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have a huge task ahead of us in the field of energy. Spain advocates a proper energy policy with a transparent single market and guaranteed supplies at the lowest environmental cost. In our opinion, we can only have a credible European energy policy if we develop a well-articulated system of interconnections between all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
      <p sl="es">We are a global player because we are not just a project for Europeans. We will not fully achieve our goals if we only defend our own interests. We will only achieve these goals if we project our values onto the international stage and if we consolidate our Union as an area of peace, stability and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The success of our integration will be measured to a large extent by what we mean to others, by the meaning that our voice has for the entire world. The future needs Europe more than ever. We must not aspire to have the world look at our great history, but at our open future.</p>
      <p sl="es">With the new Treaty, we will have effective instruments for our common foreign policy. The institutions of the President of the Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the reallocation of competences and resources will give this policy greater emphasis and continuity.</p>
      <p sl="es">We can also use the experience of recent years in which we have equipped ourselves with civil and military crisis management capabilities and successfully deployed in the most challenging places such as the Congo or Bosnia.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are the leading donor of development and humanitarian aid. This is not only because of our concept of dignity, humanist roots and sense of justice, but also because of our own interests. Only shared development and fairness in the world can guarantee security in such challenging times.</p>
      <p sl="es">In these times of profound changes in the international situation, Europe must increase its legitimacy as an area of integration and democracy and develop its capacity to achieve consensus at international level.</p>
      <p sl="es">The new Europe cannot be seen as isolated from its neighbours to the east and south. Our prosperity has to go hand-in-hand with theirs. We must make our voice heard and listen to theirs in order to engage in fruitful dialogue together.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are very committed to our relations with the countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean. In these relations we must reaffirm the true dimension of Europe: the Europe that is interested in everything that others have to contribute, that respects differences, that offers its values without imposing them and that develops partnerships within the framework of the new neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">The widest income gaps on the planet exist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean and it is in that region where deeply entrenched conflicts still persist. Yet it is also true that the societies in northern Africa are young and dynamic and that their political systems are gradually opening up allowing significant freedom. Relations with the Islamic world, in which Europe must follow a path of dialogue and partnership, will be marked by the image that we portray in this region.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must take advantage of the next EU-Africa Summit to address the justified and pressing demands of this suffering continent which is near to us and yet at the same time remote and which is knocking anxiously on our door. We must take action to keep its people in their own lands, to support them in their aspirations to live and prosper there.</p>
      <p sl="es">We can also offer a European approach to the major challenges on the international stage: for example, in the Middle East peace process and relations with the Islamic world, in the fight against international terrorism, in nuclear non-proliferation, in the strategic relationship with Russia and the major Asian countries, in respect for human rights and the expansion of democracy, in the fight against hunger and poverty, in generalising access to education and health, and in social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must increase our active presence in all geographical areas of the planet by encouraging other integration processes. Please allow me at this point to highlight, as an example, the importance of expanding our relations with Latin America and driving forward negotiations on association agreements between the Union and the various Latin American regional groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must make a decided commitment to multilateralism and reinforce the central role of the United Nations in efforts to mediate and participate in conflict resolution. It is also vital that the Union makes progress in defining a common defence policy which will enable it to participate actively and independently in the preservation of international peace and security under the mandate of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Development of the necessary civil and military capabilities, European Union Battlegroups, rapid response force initiatives and European Defence Agency programmes constitute important advances which are, however, still inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
      <p sl="es">I wanted to share with you some basic aspects of my vision of Europe and the goals which, in my opinion, we should now set with a view to the future. I have tried to talk about Europe from Spain. Please allow me now briefly to talk about Spain from Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">The policies implemented by my government in recent years have borne the same hallmark as the European priorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are going through a period of economic growth, every day opening up more and introducing reforms along the lines of the Lisbon Strategy. In 2007 we have already achieved one of the two main objectives of our National Reform Programme, namely to achieve an employment rate of 66%, and we will achieve the second objective, namely to fully converge with European per capita income, before 2010, the date initially planned.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have made a firm commitment to training human resources, providing infrastructures and expanding communication technologies. In this way we are helping to make Europe’s economy one based on knowledge which is competitive in the information society.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our social model has become richer and stronger. We have healthy public finances, with a surplus of around 2% of gross domestic product, decreasing public debt and a consolidated social security system.</p>
      <p sl="es">Employment in Spain has grown spectacularly – three million new jobs in the last four years – and jobs have become more stable. We are making progress through agreements with labour and are enjoying the period of greatest harmony in labour relations since the beginning of our democracy.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have started to implement a social policy by establishing the right to care for those who are disabled and dependent. This will henceforth form a new pillar of the welfare state.</p>
      <p sl="es">Sustainability has become a vital part of our growth model. In 2006 we managed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the first time, while still enjoying intense economic growth. We are committed to Bali as we are to Kyoto.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spanish citizens now enjoy more rights, such as greater social influence, equality between men and women, now fully developed and guaranteed by law, and, very significantly, same-sex marriages which are recognised as equal to all others and which dignify us all as a society.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain has supported multilateralism and will continue to do so. Spain has supported the European Union and the European institutions and will continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">As we have done in recent years, we will continue to increase our development cooperation so that we are among the ten leading countries in the world in terms of the percentage of our gross domestic product that we give to development aid. We will keep increasing this so that, within the next four years, 0.7% of our gross domestic product will be devoted to development aid, to bringing solidarity and dignity to millions of people around the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President,</p>
      <p sl="es">For a long time we were only able to say that, if Europe advanced, Spain would do so too. I believe that I can now say today, with both pride and humility, that if Spain continues to advance as it has done, Europe will too.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am totally convinced that Europe will exceed our expectations. We can rely on the extraordinary capability of all its institutions, particularly this Parliament. At the most difficult times, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always proved to be a defence against pessimism and a courageous and tireless champion of European integration. Today I want to thank you very particularly. Your proposals and debates have influenced the major reforms of the Union during all these years.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this House, among all of you, Europe can be felt with greater force than in any other place. Europe lives here with more hope and more confidence.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore want my final words to express Spain’s recognition, and my own personal recognition, of the prestige and work of this House and of the labour of those men and women of all ideologies and from all countries who, through the various legislatures, have enabled us, from these benches, to achieve the Europe of today and to prepare for the Europe of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have successfully overcome the recent danger. Now we must tackle the many other challenges that await. We must look firmly to the future and work together to quickly bring about the Europe that we need and, above all, the Europe that the world needs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Many thanks.</p>

    <intervention id="3-093" speaker_id="28362" name="Jaime MAYOR OREJA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group" nationality="Spain" birth_date="12-07-1951" birth_place="San Sebastian" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - Vice" m_state="ES">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, esteemed Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to thank the Prime Minister of Spain for his thoughts on the direction of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that we would have preferred his speech and his thoughts on Europe to have been given at another time, before and not after the Lisbon Summit, and specifically not seventy-two hours after his appointment as Prime Minister, because these circumstances are never beneficial to achieving the real objective of such a meeting. However, ladies and gentlemen, at the same time it would be unfair of me – and our Group would not want this – if I did not thank the Prime Minister for or rightly value his contribution which is without doubt very useful in terms of the future direction of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not easy for me to speak on behalf of the PPE-DE Group on freedom and the European Union, basically because there have been personal experiences in my Group which so typify the defence of freedom and which are so recent in their occurrence that I cannot find sufficient or adequate words to explain the deep and real meaning of the European Union for our Group.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our Group is delighted at the definite progress made at the Lisbon Summit but, at the same time, we would be lying if we did not say that our Group considers that we still do not have sufficient political momentum and ambition to transform the European Union of today into the European Union that we need for the future of the European people. We cannot achieve the Europe we need if we do not believe in ourselves. We cannot complete the European Union with inertia or fine words or simply from common ground. Words such as coherence and authenticity are not enough, for example, when tackling the transposition of European directives or complying with the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, what is missing is undoubtedly determination, defence of our values and effort. It is these elements that will enable us to consolidate the moral strength of the Union and, ultimately, its own culture which is what our project essentially stands for. However, we must make our European citizens aware of these missing elements. We must tell them about these and clearly explain them. We must share with them this political need for effort and dare to tell them the truth about what is missing. They will not be discouraged by this but will, in fact, provide the hopes, dreams and proximity that we so desperately need. We must tell them more clearly what the problems are. We must prioritise these and work on these urgent issues to find a way to distribute powers between the European Union and the European nations, without generalising, but instead by prioritising and identifying the most urgent problems that remain.</p>
      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, agreement, consensus and a gradual approach have been the traditional European methods, because consensus is a method more than a value. This means that we must define and organise this consensus and, at the same time, we have to empower the European political groups, because there will be no European Union without European political parties. This also means that we should not bring to this House any national disagreements or dissensions (which are real and deep), as were regrettably brought from Spain some months ago, as you well know.</p>
      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, there are problems that require a European solution. This without doubt strengthens the Union but, in the opinion of our Group, it also strengthens the European nations. The Union will not grow stronger as the European nations grow weaker, but in fact totally the opposite: the European Union, in order to be completed, needs its members to be strong and it will be impossible to complete this project with weakened nations which threaten its territorial integrity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The value of freedom is what unites us. This is the value to end all values and it is these values which are set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that will be signed on 12 December in Strasbourg. However, this is not just an illusion: it is a renewed commitment to freedom, and not just in the territory of our Union, but particularly in the territory of our friends with whom we have traditionally shared our culture, in Latin America and also in some republics of eastern Europe. It is in these countries too that we must try to consolidate our framework of principles and values.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have one further thing to say: coherence rather than words. History has proven the beneficial effect of our culture on the world. We should pass it on and, at the same time, be aware that we cannot lock up this value within our European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are very pleased to welcome Prime Minister Rodríguez Zapatero here to the European Parliament. We are pleased, too, that you came here after the Lisbon Summit, and that you came here just 72 hours after your nomination as candidate. We would have been even more pleased if the PPE-DE Group had at least been represented by their Group chairman today.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can tell you one thing: Mr Daul has missed a good speech from the Spanish Prime Minister this afternoon. He has also missed a less convincing speech from Mr Mayor Oreja, so it was probably a good thing for him that he was not here. Since the empty seats on the right of this House also tell their own story, let me say that when Swedish Prime Minister Reinfeldt visits us, who belongs to their political family, the Socialist Group will be in attendance in the same kind of numbers as today, because I believe courtesy is a quality that you either have or you do not, and those on the right do not have it!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Spain and the Spaniards, represented by the Prime Minister of their country, have the right to be respected, and that means respect from all the political families in this House. We accord the Spanish people that respect. Mr Zapatero, you have thanked this House and you have thanked the European Union. That was a very memorable sentence from the head of the government of Spain, a country which for 40 years suffered under a ruthless and brutal dictatorship, and which gained its freedom and democratic diversity through its integration into Europe. For you, the Spanish Prime Minister, to stand up and thank the European Union does you great credit. However, we owe you a debt of thanks too, for the fact that Spain has succeeded in these endeavours. We owe our thanks to the Spanish people and Spanish democrats, men and women. Their contribution to Europe is a contribution to democracy, diversity, cultural progress and social stability. We must therefore voice our own thanks to the Spanish Government.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Spain is a model for Europe, as is the Iberian region as a whole. The same applies, incidentally, to Greece and all those countries which had to overcome Fascist dictatorships and set a course towards the European Union in the early and mid 1980s. As Western Europeans, we had the freedom to travel to these countries at that time and so we can compare them then and now. Spain is a country with a flourishing economy. It is a country with a great future, full of hope, a country whose people have made an immense contribution to peace in the world, a country which is economically prosperous and which is rightly knocking at the door of the G8 countries because of its economic strength. Who would have thought that was possible 20 years ago? So why do I say that Spain is a model? As you yourself said, Prime Minister, if the European Union’s structural and regional policies have the same economic effects in the countries which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 as occurred in Spain, Europe as a whole can look forward to a very positive future, and that is why Spain is a model for Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, Spain – you put this very well – has won out as a result of its integration into Europe. Like many other countries in the European Union, Spain relinquished some of its sovereignty when it introduced the euro. Relinquishing sovereignty over the currency means relinquishing part of national sovereignty. However, let us imagine for a moment what might have happened if Spain still had the peseta, and imagine if the Zapatero government, as its first act in office, had said, ‘we are withdrawing our troops from Iraq’. The US dollar could have played games with the peseta, and what economic effects might that have had? Relinquishing this currency element of sovereignty actually conferred a degree of independence and sovereignty for Spain. That is another reason why Spain is a good model, showing how European integration brings more, not less, strength.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Zapatero has talked about many different issues. On behalf of my Group and on behalf of the men and particularly the women in my Group, may I say a few words about gender equality. Very few heads of government in Europe have done more to promote the rights of women than you, Mr Zapatero, and the European Parliament owes you a debt of thanks for your endeavours in that area too.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Mr Zapatero, please continue with your excellent, modern and progressive policies. They are good for Spain and what is good for Spain is also good for Europe. Keep going, Prime Minister.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when Member States ratify the Reform Treaty, as we hope and believe they will, we can look forward, at long last, to a revitalised European Union – a Union with the capacity to confront new challenges, with the humility to listen to its citizens and with the political will to act. Ratification of the Treaty cannot come a moment too soon, and my Group thanks you, Mr Zapatero, for your efforts to speed up the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">My Group sees no need for a group of wise people to ponder Europe’s future. We have been there, done that, and even have the T-shirts to prove it. It was called ‘the period of reflection’ and it has come to an end. We are midway through the Lisbon Strategy and are only now making progress in growth and jobs. We are completing the single market, freeing up the potential of Europe’s entrepreneurs. We are opening legal migration pathways to help both developing and developed economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now is not the time to go back to a French drawing board, nor to follow a new British plan for a glorified free trade zone. Those visions are just views from the margins, packaged as majority opinion. They are not where consensus lies. The majority of our citizens want the Union to deliver a strong and growing economy. They want more EU involvement across the board, more involvement in combating terrorism, more cooperation in security and defence, and more action on the environment. Then, and only then, can Europe become a global player with the capacity to bring about lasting change.</p>
      <p sl="en">For how can we assure growth and jobs if Europe retreats into protectionism? How can we combat climate change if we fail to act in concert? How can we spread peace, prosperity and justice in the world if Europe bickers at the sidelines? That is why Europe needs more politicians who are prepared to lead and to take a pan-European approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Zapatero, by uniting the 18 friends of the Constitution in Madrid, you proved that your vision of an open, integrated and competitive Europe is one shared by many. It is that vision of Europe that progressives from all parties in this House want to see thrive and expand. The ALDE Group will work together with all those who share that vision and live up to it, whether on the right, on the left or in the centre, to ensure Europe moves forward. What we will not tolerate are those who profess such a vision but fail to live up to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister, Spain is often quite rightly praised for its social and economic transformation since joining the Union. We need others to follow your example and pursue your ambition for a prosperous and open Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the Prime Minister, but in a different way. The Prime Minister came prepared for a debate on the future of Europe but, unfortunately, heard some arguments about Europe’s past rather than on where we should all be moving forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that, when we look at the needs of Europe for the 21st century, each of us knows what those needs are. Likewise, each of us knows that the ideologies of the past have failed to deliver in solving those needs on their own. Only by a combination and a coordination of those different methods and those ideals have we seen progress. Whether it is in the area of equality, whether it is in the area of justice, whether it is in the area of economic development or whether it is in the area of health and safety, it has always required individual opportunities to pick and choose out of the successful methods of the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of my Group, I should like to thank the Prime Minister for the respect he has shown to this House by thanking the Union and, in particular, Parliament, as the representative voice of the people of the European Union. We see ourselves – some of the time – as being the true representative voice. On occasions we may get it wrong, but nobody can argue with our democratic accountability and with our democratic mandate to speak on behalf of the people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Too often, the views and opinions of the European Parliament are kept to the sidelines as regards what kind of discussion takes place at intergovernmental level. I was delighted, some time ago, that, during the period of reflection on the Treaty that has now gone and will not be around again, the Prime Minister decided to regroup the ‘friends of the Community method’, calling it the ‘friends of the Constitution method’, to try and form a vanguard as regards how things can move forward. He saw that the success of that move opened up other doors and opportunities for him in government when he needed support with regard to immigration and other developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I could make an appeal to the Prime Minister today as regards the future of Europe, I would ask that he would continue to use his influence, not just in the European Union but particularly in Latin America, where issues with regard to freedom, democracy and respect for human rights are becoming ever more apparent under the guise of democratic movements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, some of us see a vision of Europe that brings bright stars, great opportunities and, most importantly, respect for the fundamental differences and dignities that exist within the European Union. We should reach a point where no longer do we try to homogenise everything into one single shape or size but understand that, by giving dignity to that difference, we can actually create a better, more colourful and, certainly, more vibrant European Union for the future.</p>

      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, the Verts/ALE Group truly appreciates your firm pro-European position, your courage to hold a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty and the ability shown by your government in driving forward, calmly and without a religious war, legislation and measures on equality, individual rights and freedoms which are an example to many countries in Europe, although I do not see many women among your entourage today.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also appreciate your comments on immigration, although not always your actions, and we appreciate the fact that emphasis has been placed on the positive aspects of immigration and not just on its illegality, as perhaps your predecessor did.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason I will say to you, Prime Minister, that we have missed you in the last two years and in recent months during the institutional crisis which ended, without a great deal of passion or glory, in the ‘mini’ Lisbon Treaty. The agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference was dictated by the enemies of the European Constitution, whereas its friends, like yourself, proved to be far too discreet following that famous meeting of the eighteen.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now in Europe we are faced with several approaches: the two-tier system of Sarkozy, the Atlantic nationalism of Gordon Brown and the rather formal but very sincere pro-Europeanism of Romano Prodi. What is your view? Who are your allies?</p>
      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, you spoke briefly about the issue of climate change, although the idea of your new contract between mankind – and womankind too I suppose – and the planet is old news. You also talked a lot about gratitude for European aid. I have to tell you that it is clear today, and has been for some time, that these European funds are also being used to make Spain the country with the most kilometres of road per inhabitant and the place where concrete, also using European money, has led to serious incidents of speculation and corruption and has helped to make Spain, together with my country of Italy, and Denmark – although you are a bit worse – a long way off complying with the Kyoto targets.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I understand it, Spain has not transposed the Eurovignette Directive and still has a very extensive infrastructure policy. We hope that, as a result of the election promises that you have made on climate change – and there is no harm in doing a bit of electoral campaigning, even here – Spain will firmly change direction. We also hope that your fantastic Environment Minister will have much greater room for manoeuvre in your government than she has now.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, to end, I must say that we here in the European Parliament very much appreciate and thank you for your words, but we need allies in the governments of the Member States. We cannot rest because we need people who want Europe and have a vision of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister, you made a fine speech. In many respects it was a humanist speech which I am willing to accept as an ideal for the Europe of the future. However, we must admit that, for the current reality of Europeans to resemble the vision you have just described, many changes must be made to the procedures and structures of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You say that our Europe is a social Europe. Bravo! It is not, however, pessimistic to say that in the main this social Europe has yet to be built. The current framework of European social policy is, according to the Treaties, an open market economy with free competition. This is a framework that naturally encourages competition between social models and naturally tends to diminish our entitlements in the name of competitiveness. This is a framework that naturally pushes down the cost of manpower, encourages job insecurity and undermines social rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The social issue is undoubtedly the main reason for our citizens’ distrust of European institutions. The President of the European Central Bank, for instance, saw this for himself when he spoke recently at the European Trade Union Confederation Conference, putting forward his theory, the official EU theory, on wage moderation in the name of competitive prices. He encountered unanimous opposition. I have already said that the German Finance Minister mentioned the risk of a crisis of legitimacy in the European social and economic model. Let us, therefore, take a look at these aspects, precisely to give some credibility to your vision of the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You also mentioned relations with Africa and the need to provide a response to their calls for justice. You are right. However, in that case, for instance, we must come back to the draft economic partnership agreement which has been rejected by all our African partners because they feel sure – and I think they are right – that development of human capacities and free trade are not a good mix.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To end, Prime Minister, I wish to thank you for reminding us of what I feel to be Europe’s ultimate objectives, and if we still cannot agree as to our view of the present, let us at least agree as to the future prospects.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is a pleasure to see the Prime Minister here in Brussels. He is an exemplar to other European heads of government, as a man who allowed his own people to decide whether they wished to have the Constitution. For that he must be applauded. In the event, the people of Spain voted overwhelmingly to support the plans.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I would like to know is why he has no intention of repeating the exercise. After all, he should be confident that he will get a similar result. Is it because, as the Prime Minister has said, the Reform Treaty has not let a single substantial point of the Constitutional Treaty go? If so, it would stand to reason that he feels there is no need to ask his people the same question twice. Or, is it the case, as presented to the British people, that the Reform Treaty is so different as to be an entirely separate thing altogether and too complicated for the people to understand?</p>
      <p sl="de">This, of course, is key to all our futures. Either the political elite do not care what people want, as in the case of Mr Sarkozy and Mr Brown, or they feel that the people are too stupid to make any decision more important than what burger to buy at McDonalds. It seems to me that the European Union is rapidly becoming the world’s first post-democratic state. I can tell the Prime Minister this: if the European elite do not allow the people to speak, then, in the end, they will find other ways to make their voices heard.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view the biggest challenge facing the European Union at the moment is the total lack of democratic participation in the decision making process. The European institutions are increasingly distrusted – quite rightly in my opinion, as it happens – by our citizens who do not accept that many very important decisions which directly affect their lives are made in ivory towers which are no longer monitored by any means or person. No democratic basis, moreover, exists for these decisions. I will give two examples.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First example: the text of the new European treaties will soon be signed in Lisbon. Everyone knows that it is a barely-altered version of the European Constitution. Mr Zapatero himself has said of it that not one substantial component has been changed. Well now, that text was voted down by democratic referendum in France and in the Netherlands, but that has all been laughed off now. The best-case scenario, as it happens, is that we may perhaps get another vote from time to time to keep the Eurocrats happy, but actual democratic statements made by means of referendum are being thrown out with the trash. In this way, I fear that Europe is increasingly heading towards becoming a small club of the type which, if it governs a super-state, will tolerate no participation and consequently can no longer really be called a democracy. The same applies, as a matter of fact, to the way in which the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union is being handled. Our citizens do not want it, quite the reverse, as Turkey is not a European country – not culturally, not geographically, not religiously, not in any way at all – but, nevertheless, the Commission and the Council are taking no account of the opinion of the majority of our citizens on the matter. Instead of a debate about the future of the Union, we should have a debate about the convalescence of democracy in the institutions of the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="3-102" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Spanish Government">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I firstly want to thank everyone who has spoken for their comments and the tone of these. I can also say that I am delighted at how lively this debate has been, which was in fact just what I had hoped for. I am also delighted to have been able to contribute to a debate of such liveliness and intensity, particularly given some of the speeches for which I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain is grateful to the European Union, to the founding fathers and to the large countries such as France, Germany and Italy which have helped us to bring democracy to our country, which have welcomed us into Europe and which have then, with their resources, contributed to our development. We are grateful to other public figures and statesmen that I have not mentioned today, such as Helmut Kohl, Mr Mitterrand and Mr Palme who have contributed so much to both the democracy of Spain and its future. We feel very proud to be contributing to this common cause.</p>
      <p sl="es">This gratitude is accompanied by the thought of what Spain has been able to achieve in the last 25 years. Probably no other society in the world has seen such a political and economic transformation and such progress in its rights, freedoms and the social situation of its people as Spain has seen in the last 25 years.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain has always been very committed to Europe and has always been very pro-European. Representatives of all parties, cultures and political ideologies and representatives with great political weight have served the European institutions, in the Commission and in this Parliament where we have had three Presidents. All have served very well and I want at this point to pay tribute to those who have represented Spain in the European institutions. They have managed to forge a common pro-European culture in a form of political organisation which, according to the speeches that have just been made, is unprecedented.</p>
      <p sl="es">The political union that we call the European Union has no precedent or model to turn to because it does not fit within any of the known political classifications. Therein lies the greatness of the European Union and also its unpredictability given the necessary process of establishing a common will shared by 27 countries, 27 flags, 27 states, 27 nations, 20 languages and a wealth of ideologies that can be seen here in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a result, every advance that we have made in the European process has had no one colour and has come from no one country or ideology. It has had no one colour, no one ideological colour, and no one flag. In fact every advance has been the sum of all parts with its own flag and its own colour which is that of coexistence and unity. If anything really represents the European soul, it is a union of democrats. That is Europe: a union of democrats which means making progress based on positions which are as consensual as possible, which respect and involve everyone and which offer the same opportunities, even to those who profoundly disagree with what the European Union represents. The greatness of the European Union lies in the fact that it is a club which offers the same opportunities to those who are in favour of Europe and to those who do not want Europe to advance. That is the greatness of the European club; that is the greatness, in short, of a union of democrats.</p>
      <p sl="es">Someone referred to a ‘mini Treaty’. The perspective that we adopt can always leave us unsatisfied in terms of achieving our objectives, but if this new Treaty is ratified by everyone and if it works, it will be a great Treaty, not a mini Treaty. That at least is the position which, in my opinion, we should adopt today. We must give it time and see the potential that it may have when brought into force and when used to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
      <p sl="es">Reference was made to ratification of the Treaty. This was necessary because Spain was one country which held a consultative referendum on the Constitutional Treaty which has since been through a process of renegotiation with the nature of a treaty, in the most classic sense of what the European concept represents.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have been asked – and I do not want to avoid any questions – why we did not submit this to a referendum. There are two very obvious reasons: the first is because the Spanish people said they were in favour of a Constitutional Treaty. The Treaty that we have now adopted, pending ratification, which is already known as the Lisbon Treaty, contains many of the aspects of the earlier Constitutional Treaty. The second reason, which is very important, is that there is broad consensus in our country on the parliamentary ratification of this Treaty, both among those of us who agree with this Treaty and even among the minorities who do not agree.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I must make one point which I feel is important for the future. I do not know whether we can achieve this at any point, but it is an obvious problem in the European Union: we have an imperfect system of ratification on which there has never been any in-depth debate. In my opinion, ratification should be common, by all countries, and, if possible, in a single act and with a single instrument. This is clearly difficult at the moment, but very desirable, and I hope that in time we can have this type of ratification.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some speakers raised the issue – which has existed from the start, since the foundation of the Union in its first configuration as the European Coal and Steel Community and then as the European Economic Community – of the relationship between the European Union and the nation states. This issue has often called into question the whole democratic health of the European Union, as many decisions are logically taken through an intergovernmental procedure.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will now very briefly give my opinion on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the nation state is a form of political organisation which, in historical terms, seeks to unify territories, rationalise public action and subsequently pave the way to democratic systems. It has therefore fulfilled an important historical task.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union is a form of political organisation which is based on the experience of the nation state. It is a higher stage of the nation state. It does not take anything away from the nation state, but rather adds to this and its traditional configuration. This is because, as demonstrated by the history of political coexistence, political civilisation and political community, to unite usually means to add. Uniting and sharing are what the European Union is all about. It is not about taking anything away from or weakening what the traditional concept of the nation state represents. In fact, the stronger the European Union is, the stronger our nation states will be. That is my opinion.</p>
      <p sl="es">This also means that the European Union will be more capable, through its institutions which need legitimacy and constant legitimation by the politicians and governments of these countries … I absolutely reject one particular theory which exists in the European Union which is that, for many of the problems that exist in our economic, private or social lives, responsibility lies with Brussels. This attitude is detrimental to the integration of the European Union and to our citizens and is also, on most occasions, usually incorrect.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that history can show us and the present can teach us that the tendency to blame others for what we have failed to achieve results in melancholy and a negative attitude among people.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some speakers mentioned concrete objectives and fine words. I agree: there can be no actions without words, and no words without actions in terms of political action. I therefore believe that everything that represents an option for the future has to have priorities, political priorities which are credible and which are observable in actions and in decisions. These are under discussion. I will summarise the three that seem most important to me for the future of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Please allow me to say that these priorities have nothing to do with treaties or operating rules or structures or revision of legislation or the reduction of legislation by the Commission which, however, would be very convenient. They relate to the political objectives of the time in which we are living. I agree with the person who said that the European Union is the fruit of the interaction of many ideologies and many values. However, the European Union can be a regional force leading the world in values and actions only if it correctly identifies the priorities of the historic times in which we are living now at the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first priority is to look at what Europe knows, because the best experiences of this continent constitute a priceless lesson. Science, creativity and innovation are what have made our economies strong and our countries socially integrated. The challenge now posed by science, which is both a challenge and an opportunity, is climate change and energy sources. I must underline something that was said in some of the speeches because it is not well-known and I did not make it very clear in my speech. It is true that Spain is a long way from meeting the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. This may be true, but it is also true that, in 2006, in other words one year after my government came to power, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 4% even though the economy grew by 4%. We are therefore engaged in intensive action which will continue with regard, firstly, to alternative and renewable energies and, secondly, to energy efficiency and saving.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some 20 years ago, the big debate on how to take the lead in innovation in Europe – I am sure that this Parliament had this debate on innumerable occasions – was all about developing the new economy, the economy of information technologies. Now the new economy that will ensure the future of productive capacity and therefore its prosperity will be the economy which can, as quickly as possible, reduce our dependency on coal and provide an alternative energy source which is increasingly powerful. In my opinion this is the first challenge. I must stress that this is not only a challenge but also a great opportunity, because herein lies a good part of the knowledge that is going to guarantee us many things and also a good part of the potential sources of jobs and activities with greater added value and, therefore, with good social capacity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, Europe must advance socially. It is true to say that Europe can only advance socially, bearing in mind the African continent, the Latin American continent or part of the Asian continent, if at the same time we make determined and decisive advances in cooperation and development aid.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is because, and please forgive me for saying this publicly, I do not know what the people and governments of many countries in Africa can think when they see the European Union sometimes having a debate on what it thinks about a deep crisis. I do not know what they can think. I am just saying how I see it. I believe that, fortunately, thanks in particular to our work on democracy, innovation capacity and the welfare state which was born in this continent, thanks to these three values (work, democracy and the welfare state), we can be the continent and the Union which has the best social protection and the highest level of income and welfare.</p>
      <p sl="es">For me, improving social welfare continues to be a fundamental objective. An open economy and a social state with social rights for the people are not incompatible. In fact, these are complementary. Social policies do not consume wealth. They can help to create wealth, to create the conditions so that everyone can participate, through education with equal opportunities, reconciliation of family and working life which requires a social policy, and employment stability which is the best incentive for productivity in the task of helping to create wealth. Social policies with productivity and people-oriented objectives are a possible model which works. Of course, the model which can achieve the biggest transformation is the model of full integration and full equality for women in all labour and social spheres.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain has changed a great deal, in part due to democracy in the last 30 years. However, what has changed Spain the most has been the integration of women into working life, social life and the civic life of the country. That is what has changed us most and what has changed us for the better, for definite, because it has involved values of solidarity and progress. I want to remind you that I have a government which consists equally of men and women; none of the people here are actually from the government.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I want to mention our third objective which, together with the challenge of climate change, the extension of social welfare and the affirmation of social rights, must be developed as a trade mark of Europe. It has enabled us to get where we are and to be a reference point for other countries. This third main objective is to ensure and reinforce coexistence in a very particular manner, bearing in mind that we live in a continent which, in the last 20 or 30 years, has seen increased demographic changes in many countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">This coexistence means integration and absolute and total intolerance of any signs of racism and xenophobia. This is what coexistence means. Europe must not betray a single one of its values and, if there is one essential value in the democratic Europe, it is respect for cultural and religious diversity and therefore the firm rejection of any signs of xenophobia or racism. We would fail as Europeans if we succumbed to this temptation.</p>
      <p sl="es">This coexistence must be accompanied by great tolerance. Increasing individual and collective rights is not only the best expression of freedom, it is also another value with which, in my opinion, Europe must identify. For indeed, what better freedom can there be than respecting the religious, cultural and political beliefs of everyone or their sexual orientations when forming a partnership or entering into a marriage? What better expression of freedom is there than this?</p>
      <p sl="es">If Europe is the union of democrats, as I said before, it cannot be just about freedom: Europe must be about freedom and equality.</p>

I would like to thank you and Spain – all the governments which worked in a free Spain on European matters – for your contribution to Europe. Based on our experience of the last two decades, we are confident that no matter who governs in Spain in future, Spain will always remain true to its European calling.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, I will limit my remarks to the issue of immigration, a major concern for the future of Europe in relation to which you made some consensual proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that nobody can teach any lessons in such a difficult area, but it is also true that nobody can feel they are exempt from the solidarity required in a unified space. Opinion polls show that certain countries have a more economic approach, and others a more cultural approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In countries that place economic interests first, of course it is convenient to secure essential labour by adapting the laws, and hence the regularisation measures occasionally adopted en masse by national governments, without worrying too much about the concern that this causes, while the other Member States attempt to control migratory flows.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We could mention, for example, your government’s operation to regularise hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. France expressed its regret and disapproval at the time. Our President was quite candid about it. There must be no repetitions of this kind of operation in the future. All the more so since Spain legitimately receives EU funds to deal with the dramatic situations on its African borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The PPE advocates policies based on individual processing of applications for regularisation, and therefore refuses to accept en masse regularisations which do nothing but increase concerns. Along the same lines, the French Presidency will propose a European immigration pact. Moreover, Prime Minister, in the years to come, the Lisbon Treaty will provide the means to act in unison and refrain from implementing go-it-alone policies. This is in the long-term interest of the European Union, Spain and all the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Prime Minister, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Spanish Socialists I should like to thank the Prime Minister for coming here today.</p>
      <p sl="es">It has been said that his speech was an ideal speech. It has also been said that he has a very ambitious agenda. What I should like to say to the Prime Minister, first of all, is that his approach has been proven in practice; in other words, he has given a series of economic, political and social data that not only justify pro-Europeanism in general but also in fact. At this point, please allow me to briefly refer to something that was said here today. The issue of mass regularisations was mentioned. At the moment, France and Germany are copying the system of regularisation</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">adopted by Spain, involving individual regularisation and the participation of employers and trade unions. Please tell us, Mr Toubon, what is happening in your country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, Mr President, I want to give my personal thanks to the Prime Minister for the reference he made to certain veterans and to our work which we have been carrying out here for many years. I want to make one point in this respect: in addition to what we have received – and it is only right and proper to be grateful – we have contributed certain elements. The popular and social Europe, cohesion and the Charter of Fundamental Rights are not under Spanish copyright but they have been heavily influenced by Spain and of this we can feel legitimately proud.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards ratification, I agree with what the Prime Minister said. What is striking is that people who have done nothing in their country and who have not taken one step towards ratifying the Constitution or approving the Treaty are trying to give lessons to those who have done their job.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">I must now make one very specific point. In this ratification process, there has to be a call for solidarity and mutual loyalty; it is not right that some do their job while others try to renegotiate. This must stop in Europe once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Mr President, Mr Mayor Oreja has suffered a slip of the tongue because he has re-elected Mr Zapatero as Prime Minister some months before the elections. Mr Zapatero is, at the moment, only a candidate for Prime Minister. What would be interesting is if, with a view to the election of the next Commission President, the political groups, starting with the PPE-DE Group, were to pass the candidate a copy of Mr Zapatero’s speech.</p>

      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, welcome to this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fortunately, in Spain, the commitment to European construction has united most of the political forces, including those in Catalonia. This unity, which began in 1986, continued with the euro and was repeated in the debate on the European Constitution. It has enabled previous governments and also your own government to lead the campaign for a political and ambitious Europe. Your speech today confirms this same commitment and I congratulate you on this.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, Prime Minister, your responsibility does not end with enthusiastic speeches laden with European fervour. Europe needs leaders committed to its project in their day-to-day political actions and not just on solemn and institutional occasions. We cannot always see this commitment day to day in certain actions of your government, with the result that unproductive confrontations with the European Commission cannot be avoided. We also cannot see this commitment in those people who seem to wait for others to take the initiative before deciding on their own position.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any event, it is time for the political leaders to build a Europe which gives its people hope for this joint project. This is because, Mr Zapatero, Europe is more than just the sum of the domestic successes of its governments, including those that you may have had.</p>
      <p sl="es">The adoption of the Lisbon Treaty will mark the end of one phase, but the work will only just have begun. It will be time to continue building a space of freedom, security and justice; time to build a truly European immigration policy; time to improve the competitiveness of our companies and the welfare opportunities of our citizens, and time also to raise the voice of Europe in the world and improve relations with our neighbours, including those in the Mediterranean where so much help can be given by Spain.</p>
      <p sl="es">Without renouncing or failing to reflect its extreme national and linguistic diversity, Spain therefore has much to offer in making this great common ideal a reality and you, if the ballot boxes give you back the confidence to govern, either alone or in company with others, will have to make an absolute personal commitment to achieving these objectives.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Mr President. Prime Minister, the Lisbon Treaty adopted in December will not just shape institutional preconditions for Europe’s future. In my view there are three assessments regarding Lisbon’s results on which everyone to whom Europe’s future is important can agree – both those who welcome what was achieved in Lisbon, and those who reject it. Since the agreement in Lisbon there have been grounds for a certain optimism about the future of the European Union, firstly with regard to the Member States’ ability to agree; secondly, there is a cautious attitude towards assessing the agreement achieved, since it will not be possible to evaluate the real effect of the Treaty in that area until it has been in force for several years; the third is a negative assessment of the fact that, following the outcome of the referendums in the Netherlands and France, the Constitutional Treaty became a treaty partly by avoiding listening to public opinion. Paradoxically, however, one of the Constitutional Treaty’s basic tasks was to make it more comprehensible and acceptable to European society. As a member of the European Convention I object to the use and the spirit of the word ‘constitution’ for the new treaty. The outcome of Lisbon follows an approach that I endorse, but I do not think that the reasons for the changes will serve Europe’s future. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr Zapatero, I am absolutely delighted that you are here today and that you have placed such importance on the challenge of climate change and also on the need to act now. Welcome to the club.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time, words must be accompanied by positive political decisions and the undeniable truth is that Spain is still the black sheep on climate change with figures well behind the Kyoto targets. This requires a substantial response in terms of renewable energies; we need a policy with taxation. I am very happy about the, albeit deceptive, proposal made with regard to the additional cent on petrol. At the same time, I should like Spain to present a proposal on a European-wide environmental tax to tackle the avalanche of foreign products and imports of polluting products.</p>
      <p sl="es">We would be delighted if the extensive coal subsidies could be abolished, at both European and Spanish level, if tax measures to reduce the crazy Spanish energy consumption could be taken seriously and if investments in infrastructure could be redirected towards the railways and other forms of public transport and not towards the roads.</p>
      <p sl="es">On a more positive note, I should like to congratulate you most sincerely on the abandonment by Spain of nuclear energy. This gradual abandonment is very important and I would ask other European leaders to take note of this because nuclear energy is very expensive, very dangerous and very slow to build and is not the answer to climate change.</p>

There is still time for Europe to hold a referendum, in all the Member States, on the same day, to take account of the one fundamental element in our history: the people. Our position is not merely window-dressing; it is deeply democratic in the sense that we cannot build a European project or finish building this without the direct participation of the people.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe you are being excessively optimistic when you say that we have finished building our social Europe. In this House we very often have to co-legislate with direct attacks on the European social state in terms of work and job security. We currently have a debate ongoing about flexicurity.

These are energy, climate change, structural funds, cooperation in criminal law, intellectual property, and so on. The European Parliament is becoming co-legislator for 95% of European legislation. Therefore Parliament will be deciding double the amount of legislation that it does today. Moreover, the European Parliament will elect the President of the European Commission who will have to report to the European Parliament on each of his discussions in the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Therefore, in 2009, the European Parliament will be the strongest Parliament since its first session in 1968. It will be an equal partner with the other European institutions. Therefore we will be obliged to increase turnout in the elections to this strong body in 2009. Turnout in the last elections to the European Parliament was the lowest ever. Only 47% of the electorate took part, and in Slovakia, which I represent here, the figure was as low as 11%. A great deal of work lies ahead of us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, actually, I wanted to congratulate Mr Schulz. He has managed to ensure that he will get a pat on the back from his Socialist friends with his dull – if not to say dumb – polemics directed at the PPE-DE Group. Soon after he had finished speaking, there were just as many empty seats on the Socialist side as there are over here. Tempting though it is to claim that the Socialists only listen to their great leaders but are not interested in debate, I will refrain from doing so because we are supposed to treat each other with respect. I think an apology is warranted from Mr Schulz.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me inject a bit of life into the debate by asking you this: what lessons have we actually learned today? Well, we have found out that the Spanish are a European nation. I think I am right in saying that they were the same nation when Prime Minister Aznar addressed us. However, we have also heard a domestic policy speech with an eye to the elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not think it is the task of the European Parliament to go along with that. Angela Merkel and President Sarkozy were also here, and they did not pursue a domestic agenda; they talked about Europe. These debates are only of any value if we look at matters of detail. In that respect, my colleague Mr Dupont is quite right, of course. The fact that Spain has legalised 700 000 immigrants was condemned in unequivocal terms by President Sarkozy last week here in the European Parliament. It would have been interesting to hear why there is obviously some dispute over this issue in the European Council. It would have been interesting to hear how we are really tackling immigration. We know that there is massive illegal immigration taking place and we know that clear European directives setting out rules and procedures for the return of illegal migrants are on the table. These directives are being blocked in the European Council and are not moving forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">I fail to see how we can explain to our citizens why we are talking about Europe’s great and noble values here in this House, and yet in the daily business of the European Council – of which you are also a member, Prime Minister – progress has stalled, unfortunately.</p>
      <p sl="de">My message is this: European speeches are important, and talking about Europe’s fundamental values is important, but European action must take priority.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, when we speak of the future of Europe, history is never very far away. It was quite straightforward for our fellow citizens while the Berlin Wall was there. We knew where the threat lay for it had a location and a face. We were the vanguard of freedom, even right next to Franco, and anyway it was not necessary to talk about borders because they were drawn by an Iron Curtain. This sectioned Europe off nicely, and that was the end of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nowadays I feel the future of Europe lies in its geography. We need only take a look at our surroundings. We are right next to the world’s battlefield, from Gaza to Kabul. They need some European spirit of reconciliation over there. We are also in close proximity to the hunger zone, the world’s land of pandemics, Africa, which you also mentioned. Some sharing has to be done there, for it is here we can control the migratory flows.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then we also find ourselves in close proximity to a region that has been showing signs in recent years of religious fanaticism. I do not include everyone, of course. Here, at the same time, we must call for a dialogue of cultures and not of culture shocks. We are also in close proximity to oil and gas reserves. We need them. This means that part of our prospects depends on secure supplies and energy independence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are a few explanations we could give to our fellow citizens who are a little lost here. Modern Europe is located at the centre of continent nations. There are no empires any more. You had one, and so did we. There are some bits of it left here and there. There are no blocs anymore. Europe must be given a new direction. This cannot be achieved by simply adding directives. Some broad prospects must be outlined in order to rebuild or attempt to rebuild a kind of European dream. This is my partial vision of the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I wish to beg your indulgence, Prime Minister, for next year is the two hundredth anniversary of Napoleon I’s Spanish campaign. Since you are an acquaintance of mine, and next year includes the French Presidency, please be indulgent with us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the Prime Minister for his refreshing speech about political union. I would be grateful if he could find the time to travel to London to repeat it to Gordon Brown, his fellow Social Democrat Prime Minister, including the passages on the importance of the social dimension of the single market, and the importance of solidarity and the cohesion of the Union faced with global challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a fortnight the Prime Minister will be at the December European Council meeting, discussing with President Sarkozy the proposal to create a comité des sages . I would be grateful if he could tell President Sarkozy that we ought not to upset the prospects for ratification of the Treaty by reopening quarrels about procedures and the balance of power. Please could he also tell him that it is not sensible to try to set the geographical frontiers of Europe. The enlargement process is firmly established. Europe will find its final shape when European countries as yet outside the Union stop wanting to join us.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, from a geographical point of view, Europe has been clearly defined and its borders established. In a political context, however, the term Europe has become synonymous with the enlarging European Union. On the one hand, not all European countries belong to this organisation, yet on the other, most Members of the European Parliament are pressing for the admission of non-European countries like Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When discussing Europe’s future it is important to consider its roots and fundamental values. There are thousands of documents referring to European values. The latter are not always clearly defined, however, not even in the Charter of Fundamental Rights debated today, for example. When all is said and done, European roots are Christian, and those fundamental values were defined long ago. Constant efforts to define the obvious lead to distortions of proportion. They also affect the potential for responding to the real problems of the old continent, such as the worrying ageing of Europe’s population, migration, aggressive competition from Asian countries, terrorism, epidemics, new diseases and also energy security.</p>

      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, it is right and proper that we should recognise that, following a worrying period of uncertainty, you have been one of the leaders who has reinvigorated the European transatlantic relationship and I must congratulate you on this.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, for those of us who regard ourselves as deeply pro-European, it is sad to see that this transatlantic relationship is still laden with two items of ballast that previously made it sink: too much mercantilism and too much intergovernmentalism. We also note that, although the ship is sailing well, the direction taken – or the course set, to put it in maritime terms – is the one shown by the compass of Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy which is making the boat list clearly towards the Conservative right.</p>
      <p sl="es">The question is: what room for manoeuvre do you have, Prime Minister, in order to right the ship and correct the course? How do you think you can convince those who, despite being pro-European, are afraid of boarding the European ship because they do not see it as safe, or because they do not know where it is going, or because they cannot see either a social Europe or an environmentally sustainable Europe or an internationally responsible Europe or a transparent, democratic and popular Europe of which we have spoken so often? Do you think you can lead the jump from market Europe to political Europe? How?</p>
      <p sl="es">Also, as you have congratulated this House so much, do you not think it is time for this Parliament to be the main European legislator?</p>
      <p sl="es">Incidentally, while we are on the subject, and in light of the new information on the use of Spanish bases for the transport of prisoners to Guantanamo, does the government intend, though the UN Security Council, to review its relations with the US?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, Parliament will be deciding tomorrow whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be legally binding in future. For me, having been a member of the Convention established to draw up the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights, this will be a very important vote, not just because I had the honour of working on what is the most modern European document on fundamental rights, and not just because I – like many others – fought for seven years to ensure that it became legally binding.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Charter of Fundamental Rights is based on the indivisibility of civil, political and social rights. For me, as a left-wing Member of this House who comes from Berlin and lived in the GDR until the peaceful revolution in 1989, this is of fundamental importance. For me, the resounding ‘yes’ to the Charter is the logical consequence of our critical appraisal of our own history: an appraisal which was necessary and which focused on the massive violation of fundamental and human rights under ‘actually existing socialism’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Your country, Prime Minister, plays an important role in the EU. By voting ‘yes’ in the referendum to what was then the Constitutional Treaty, the citizens of Spain made a major contribution to the Charter not being shelved. You can and should build on this achievement. Everyone has great expectations of Europe. They expect Europe to address their daily needs and concerns. They want Europe to work in a substantive way – and not just hum the melody, as Jean-Claude Juncker said – in order to create a Europe of the workers, a Europe that is genuinely based on solidarity. That is why a vigorous campaign needs to be conducted in the European Union against social and wage dumping. Minimum wages for everyone which safeguard people’s livelihoods: that is what we need. The social issue is indeed crucial for the future of Europe!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Prime Minister, the Lisbon Treaty, or rather the renamed Constitution, is your view of Europe’s future. This is the Constitution that was decisively rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, and which we are now seeking to force through without the consent of the people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Across the 27 Member States, opinion polls show that a majority of citizens want a referendum on the Treaty. In the UK, 80% want a referendum, and two thirds would vote ‘no’, yet our government denies us the vote it solemnly pledged in its election manifesto.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister, you speak of a Europe of democracy, but Europe tramples on public opinion. The contempt we show for public opinion makes a mockery of our claim to be a ‘Union of Values’. Over and over again my constituents tell me that they voted in 1975 for a free trade area, not a political union. It is time to dismantle the supranational political structures of the EU and return to the simple trading group which the British were promised in 1972.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the fact that we are welcoming the Spanish Prime Minister to our sitting today could mistakenly give the impression that we are still in the reflection period about the Constitution, as this series of discussions with prime ministers was set up for that purpose. Happily, however, that period is behind us and in the meantime we have agreement on a good Reform Treaty. Of course you are welcome here, Prime Minister, because it is now worth talking about the future of Europe. This is more the case now then ever, because the Treaty is not an end but a new beginning.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is not an end in itself; it is an instrument that we must employ effectively and that offers us a perspective on a better administration, on more democracy, on the realisation of values such as freedom, security, prosperity and a further extension of our socio-market economy in an open and globalised world. You can take it from me, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that these are the same goals that are pursued by many of the Belgian people in their desire for state reform.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to salute the Prime Minister for being one of the not so many prime ministers who speaks the same language here in Brussels as in their respective capitals. I should also like to salute him for being one of the very few prime ministers who does not hide what Europe is and should be to their own people. Therefore, his people support him, so there was that great ‘yes’ to the European Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Prime Minister on regaining for Spain the right level of representation in this House, in this Parliament, with effect from 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the message of Spain is clear to us, and we share this message: Europe will be either social or not at all; Europe will be either a global player or not at all; Europe will either be able to combine solidarity with subsidiarity or it will fail; Europe will either be able to offer a model of sustainable growth or it will vanish; Europe will either able to offer a solution in favour of social inclusiveness, gender equality and popular empowerment or it will fall apart; Europe will be able to associate multiculturalism with civic cohesion, free competition with generosity, efficiency with justice and flexibility with security, or it will become meaningless.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also share the Prime Minister’s point of view that security is indivisible and it should be individual, social, national and international for all. I also share his point of view on immigration. Yes, the right answer to immigration challenges is integration and not expulsion; integration and not marginalisation. The right answer should be directed towards treatment of the causes and not of the symptoms.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand very well why the Prime Minister does not need a new referendum for the new Treaty. He already has a ‘maxi-mandate’ and, therefore, he may accept a mini-Treaty. We have to ratify this Treaty quickly and then restart on our way towards a more integrated Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as I have followed this debate, the impression I have gained is that everything is fine and is going to be better still, though it is actually so good already that it could hardly be any better. There are, however, a number of problems about which the great leaders of the European Union speak as one but seem to be mistaken.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are confronted by a new quasi-religion, namely the so-called greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is presented in such a way as to lead to a call for maximum reduction of emissions. European countries are therefore forced to compete with countries that do not have such strict plans for restricting emissions, In the meantime, all serious scientists now believe that the greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that occurs on a cyclical basis and that the sum of mankind’s efforts can only make a difference of a few percentage points at most.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you not to engage in wishful thinking.

      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, we Spanish Members should also be flattered because you have come here today, before reporting to the Spanish Parliament on the result of the Lisbon Council, something which you no doubt plan to do, before the Spanish Parliament is dissolved, because you must agree that the Spanish people deserve an explanation given that, as you have mentioned, they were the first to have a referendum on a Constitution that still does not exist.</p>
      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, the pro-European commitment of your speech is fully shared by the vast majority of this House. That is why I would imagine that now, from Europe and towards Spain, as you have said, you will share our concern that Spain has been the worst in Europe for transposing the Community directives into national law and yet has been in the lead in terms of proceedings for infringements of EU laws. Likewise, I have to say that your commitments here today on the environment – which can only deserve praise – contrast with the harsh reality of the facts, because just today we have heard about a European Commission report which indicates that our country is the one that is furthest from meeting the targets laid down in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, I cannot wish you luck in the elections next March. It is true that your speech was more like a campaign speech than anything else, but I do want you, and this is the crux of the matter, to do your utmost to re-establish the consensus between the Spanish political forces in the European institutions which has disappeared, Prime Minister, not due to initiatives which have come from this side of the …</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I will very briefly make two points on the issues that have been raised most insistently: immigration policy and the regularisation of the situation of migrants in Spain.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am in favour of a common immigration policy for the European Union covering border control, integration and a statute for its common regulation. We are far from this point but I can assure the two Members who raised this issue of one thing: when I became Prime Minister, I found that in my country there were 700 000 illegal migrant workers who were being exploited, who were not paying any taxes or social security contributions and who were working in the informal or illegal economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our European values are rights, legality, transparency and the rule of law. I will therefore always try to ensure that, in my country, no one is working illegally, no one is being exploited, no one is being denied their rights and no one is failing to contribute to the burdens shouldered by a democratic country. Never.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">I do not know how many of these 700 000 entered through France. I do not know. What I do know is that France and Spain, after much dialogue, because there were differences of opinion, now share a common philosophy and a common political approach. The same is true with the German Government. The experiences and circumstances of each country have been very different due to the lack of a common immigration policy. When there is no common immigration policy, we tend to blame our problems on France, or those of France are blamed on Spain, or those of Germany on Italy or those of Italy on Germany. This serves absolutely no purpose and is also harmful to European construction.</p>
      <p sl="es">When we have a policy of shared external borders, with everyone controlling these together, and a policy of integration and common status, we will not be tempted to criticise a country which tackles the issue of 700 000 people working illegally so that they can become legal.</p>
      <p sl="es">On climate change, I cannot stress this any more firmly, but I also do not want to look back to any particular government, because there have been governments in my country of all colours … Without doubt there has been enormous economic growth in Spain. The only thing I know is that the government over which I preside is the only one to have stopped the growth of greenhouse gas emissions – which we did in 2006 – and the only one to have started to reduce these while increasing economic growth by 4%. Also, 2006 was the first year when the primary consumption of electricity in Spain was reduced. We are extremely determined in this area, as we have been in other areas of political action where we have not hesitated to pass far-reaching laws on rights or to take forceful decisions on foreign policy when we have been against certain actions. In the international arena, we will not fail to be firm or determined when tackling what I have described as a huge challenge and a huge opportunity. I can assure you that Spain is not the worst and certainly will not be so in the next few years because we are going to make a huge national effort to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to invest in alternative renewable energies and to pursue a policy of energy efficiency and saving.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will end by reiterating my profound gratitude to the European Parliament. I have felt content here and also European, deeply European and, when I leave this common House of the European people, I will feel even more European. I should very much have liked to come here earlier.</p>

In employment, we must achieve full equality of opportunities, combat social exclusion, support those who lag behind, those in disadvantaged situations and those who have been forced onto the edges of society. Particularly great attention must be devoted to small and medium-sized enterprises, which may be tokens of a welfare society and an appropriate level of employment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to explain where we are in the economic partnership agreement (EPA) negotiations. I am glad to note that the strategy proposed by the Commission in its communication of 23 October was endorsed by the Council last week. As Commissioner Mandelson said to Parliament’s Committee on International Trade last week, we have turned a corner in these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">These negotiations are moving very quickly. Let me give you a sense of where we stand at this moment. In East Africa, a stepping-stone agreement has been initialled with the East African Community: Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania. We are very close to an interim deal with the Indian Ocean countries in the context of the Eastern and Southern Africa grouping.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Southern African Development Community, we have initialled a stepping-stone agreement with Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique. Angola will join as soon as it is able. South Africa and Namibia will decide on their participation in the next day.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the Pacific region, we are working in parallel on an umbrella agreement for the region as a whole and specific agreements on market access to safeguard the immediate interests of those countries which account for the region’s trade with the European Union. I expect agreement on those to be announced very shortly.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the remaining regions, the picture is less clear. For West Africa and Central Africa, meetings are taking place with so-called ‘subgroups’. It is possible that we will be able to conclude interim agreements on goods with the countries most affected, which could then be enlarged to full EPAs with the whole region in 2008. That will, of course, depend on the wish of those concerned to take this route and to present WTO-compatible market access agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Caribbean region, we have an agreement on nearly everything but, crucially, not on trade in goods, where the region’s proposal falls well short of what can be defended in the WTO. Negotiations are continuing, but we now need a clear political decision from the region to unlock the negotiations by producing a WTO-compatible market access schedule.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all regions, we are taking a pragmatic and flexible approach to achieving what remains our objective for these agreements: full EPAs with four regions. This will modernise our trade relationship and put it at the service of development, so full agreement with four regions is our objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made significant progress in recent days, but we cannot today guarantee that there will be an agreement including new WTO-compatible trade arrangements with all ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">WTO compatibility is the essential component of all agreements, whether they are full EPAs, stepping-stone agreements, or even goods-only deals. Without this, we can only offer the generalised system of preferences.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next week, the General Affairs and External Relations Council will decide on the EC regulation to implement the market access which has been offered to the ACP. It is the best ever offer in a bilateral agreement: full duty/quota-free access, with transition periods for only two products – sugar and rice.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will continue to do everything possible to reach agreements. Our offer is on the table and the moment any ACP state provides a WTO-compatible offer to complete a deal, we can move quickly to propose to the Council that it should benefit from the EPA market access regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have indicated our willingness to work with subregions, if that is what the ACP states wish. We have agreed to continue negotiating beyond 1 January 2008 on other issues, like services, investment and other trade-related areas, which are such an important part of the development component of these agreements. We have delivered on our commitment to provide trade arrangements equivalent to or better than Cotonou to any country reaching an agreement with us. We have offered to open our markets fully and match the goods trade offer with generous services offers.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we cannot do is extend the Cotonou trade regime while we continue negotiations. In the absence of an EPA, we have made clear that we cannot and will not propose solutions which are illegal or insecure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our ACP partners will need support to implement the agreements and make the necessary adjustments and reforms. This is why the Commission is working to ensure that the European Development Fund will make ‘aid for trade’ in the context of EPAs a priority. It is why we are working closely with Member States so that they bring additional money in the context of the newly-adopted EU aid-for-trade strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that concluding these negotiations means taking difficult political decisions, but we welcome the leadership shown by those ACP regions and countries which have decided to join us in initialling EPA agreements. We will continue to support them as they implement the commitments they have made and as we work together to ensure that this is a trade relationship that genuinely contributes to their development.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, after seven years of negotiations, to say that we are not where we should be is perhaps an understatement. I am not sure that is correct to say that we have turned the corner.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over the last few weeks some ACP members have grown increasingly uneasy at the prospects of the limited – as the Commissioner himself described it – GSP tariff regime that awaits them on 1 January should they not sign up to an EPA agreement. The European Commission claims to have been successful in its pursuit of an interim agreement with both individual states and subregional groups. As the Commissioner said, it signed with the East African group yesterday, while the SADC signed last week – but without South Africa and without Namibia! What sort of economic agreement is it that misses countries out? It is reported that the Commission is pushing West Africa into an agreement without Nigeria, which is one of the biggest countries in Africa and has huge trade negotiations on the table with the European Union. What is the long-term effect of these so-called framework agreements being signed? What about regional integration? As far as I can see these are breaking up the very regions described in my report that are what EPAs are all about.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament’s resolution, prepared by a political group, sets out clearly the need to look forward to these now fast-moving negotiations. We may not like these arrangements, but the deadline is almost upon us and at the moment there are no alternatives. The Kigali Declaration was extremely heavy and critical. Our resolution today in Parliament is forward-looking, and I hope that we can look forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">As their name suggests, EPAs are a stepping stone to full and comprehensive trade relations between the EU and the ACP. I am disappointed that the PSE Group has decided not to vote on them.</p>
      <p sl="de">I leave the Commissioner with one final thought. In the United Kingdom there is a saying which goes there are three great lies in the world: ‘the cheque is in the post’; ‘it was not my fault’; and ‘I am from the European Union and I am here to help’.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot help noticing that the way in which negotiations were conducted by the Commission has failed to secure signature of genuine EPAs before the scheduled date. Here I agree with Mr Sturdy: the interim agreements call into question the regional groups that had been created and formed the basis of discussions to sign these EPAs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Far from strengthening links and trust between Europe and ACP states, negotiations have aroused great concern. There is concern in relation to losses of public resources: the Senegalese President recently told the press that between 35% and 70% of African budgets were made up of customs tariffs: Nigeria is set to lose 800 million euros, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is concern in relation to the consequences of liberalisation for fragile sectors of ACP economies, which will have to face competition from European businesses. There is concern in relation to the requests to include a number of subjects in the second phase, which do not correspond to WTO obligations. Here I am thinking of services, investment, public markets and the rules of competition. There is concern in relation to the threat of introducing higher customs tariffs in 2008 for non-LDC ACP states as a kind of blackmail forcing them to accept any agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I feel we need to give ACP-EU relations a new lease of life and get negotiations back on the tracks of the main Cotonou principles. EPAs are development instruments. Liberalisation is not an end in itself. The aim of EPAs is to strengthen ACP economies to help them move into the world economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">No ACP state should be worse off after an EPA than before it was signed. The signatories must benefit from a preference system at least as favourable as before any EPA signature. Agreements must be based on the interests of the ACP states and their economic diversification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The rules of origin must be clarified to ascertain the extent to which they will benefit from any new market access measures we put forward, and genuine mechanisms for financial compensation must be implemented. The message in the Kigali Declaration by members of parliament in ACP states and in Europe must be understood. The date of 31 December is not as fatal a blow as the one you dealt.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the ALDE Group backed the request from the leader of the Socialist Group to postpone the vote, in an attempt to reach a broader agreement on the text of the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="it">We likewise share the concerns and hopes summarised in the concluding document of the Kigali meeting. EPAs are an important tool of development, regional integration and poverty reduction. EU action in this globalised world of ours must pursue these goals. Free trade, the WTO rules and even EPAs are not an end in themselves but tools at the service of world trade.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, we must also acknowledge that the legal void arising from the expiry of the Cotonou Agreement puts the ACP countries themselves at serious risk; there is much more at stake than whether or not these agreements are legitimate in the light of WTO rules and decisions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We too hope that the negotiations underway in the six regions can be concluded rapidly, and that the resumption and successful conclusion of the more complicated Doha negotiations on the reform of world trade can provide a clear-cut framework in which the developmental needs of the poorest countries can be better met, including in terms of EU-ACP relations.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are aware, however, that the ACP negotiations are proceeding slowly and that the reform of world trade, which would also have the merit of revitalising multilateralism in world trade, is flagging.</p>
      <p sl="it">Feasible solutions should therefore be pursued in a pragmatic manner. To this end we believe that the Commission’s chosen strategy of a two-stage approach – namely first interim agreements relating only to trade and then a more general agreement – serves to avoid an interruption in the flow of goods at favourable rates, as provided for at Cotonou, which could be very detrimental to the ACP countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, it was astonishing to hear you talking about the negotiations as though nothing had gone awry and everything had gone swimmingly for the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the last few months, we – here in Parliament – have pointed out on several occasions that the Commission has overburdened the negotiations with the ACP countries. We pointed out that an agreement on goods was enough to meet the WTO conditions and that an agreement on the Singapore issues was not essential. This criticism fell on deaf ears in the Commission; indeed, the Commission brushed our criticism aside. Your abrupt change of course towards interim ‘goods-only’ agreements is too little, too late. ‘Goods-only’ at this stage is a confession of failure caused by your own lack of insight. It would have done you more credit had you admitted self-critically for once that your negotiating strategy was a mistake.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second big mistake was the way in which the negotiations were conducted. They were obviously conducted as if they were simply about an ordinary free trade agreement, not a development-based framework agreement. The ACP countries were unanimous in complaining that they were put under pressure, and this testifies to the miserable atmosphere at the negotiations. We heard this message very clearly in Kigali, and I must say to the Commission that the tone of negotiations is very important too, not just the substance.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is vital to avoiding making yet another big mistake. We now need a solution for those non-LDC countries which do not feel able to sign up at present. We must avoid a collapse of trade relations, so we need a proposal for a transitional arrangement for 2008.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission’s negotiating strategy was completely wrong; in fact, it was a catastrophe. It was based on the ‘Global Europe’ strategy, which is all about market access for Europe’s major transnational corporations.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have always wondered what this approach has to do with partnership agreements. Partnership means something completely different. Partnership means respect for the country which needs to carry out economic and social development. A partnership agreement must foster respect for the fact that the provision of development aid must not be linked to the conclusion of an EPA. Economic partnership agreements have to take account of the development of the weak, and weakest, countries. No country, if it does not sign, should be in a worse situation than it is already. That is fair partnership and that is an approach based on solidarity. The Commission was miles away from that. I think it is a good thing that, under pressure from many sides, it is now starting to pursue a different strategy, although I am very sceptical about this when I see how it is acting with Mercosur, ASEAN and the Andean countries, where it is still pursuing the same old way of thinking.</p>
      <p sl="de">We Europeans seem to be saying, ‘this is what is going to happen, take it or leave it’. I repeat, that has nothing to do with partnership. I was rather annoyed – in fact I was appalled – by what happened here today, that we could not use the Kigali decision as a basis, even though it was endorsed by all the Members who were in Kigali. Parliament should have given this delegation its support by endorsing the decision.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, EPAs are a controversial theme in Africa and are increasingly developing into one in Europe. This issue involves fundamental differences of insight concerning the possibility of fighting poverty by means of sustainable economic growth in ACP countries. It is clear that purely financial aid has not made a real contribution to the reduction of poverty. We believe that these trade agreements can offer a window through which we can get away from a long history of barely effective aid. The global trade with ACP countries has decreased. It is now less than 1% and the Millennium Development Goals have not been achieved in Africa. The situation must change. Europe has a moral duty to help the ACP countries grow economically and to increase trade with them. The EPAs must make a contribution to this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the benefits of trade and economic integration are evident, particularly in an increasingly globalised world. Competition, a good climate for investment, market access, and working factories are essential for economic growth in ACP countries. We must be flexible and pragmatic, but within the framework of the World Trade Organization. The signing of the completed trade agreements is no longer expected by the deadline of 1 January 2008. Some countries in East and South Africa have, however, reached interim agreements. These are goods-only agreements. They cannot be called a step towards regional development. We must quickly start supplying technical support to strengthen these countries and then eventually reach a complete agreement, including, for example, services.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my Group recommends, as others have said, that, in the interests of credibility and authenticity, Parliament establish a position which reflects what was unanimously agreed at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly and was reflected by the Kigali Declaration. I believe that it is both a moderate and balanced document, which represents lengthy and successful negotiations between all our political groups – including, of course, Mr Sturdy’s political group, as he made reference to it – and with the ACP.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have never encountered the kind of pressure that the ACP has faced during these negotiations, especially as they are threatened with being severely disadvantaged by Europe’s GSP tariff regime. It is that threat that has caused the emergence of new regional groupings, and we will possibly see bilateral agreements, for example with Côte d’Ivoire. These subgroupings which the Commissioner has talked about are not something that we should see as a great achievement, but rather as something that threatens regional integration and is causing massive regional tensions amongst the ACP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar and Comoros have agreed a subregional EPA; West and Central Africa have put forward no market access offers and so face GSP. South Africa and Namibia, in the SADC, seem to have reached a red line they cannot cross and are being asked to include most-favoured-nation clauses which would oblige them to give the EU any market access they may concede in the future to other countries. The Pacific, of course, is also not experiencing the best of negotiations and it is unlikely that any countries other than Fiji and Papua New Guinea will sign or initial.</p>
      <p sl="en">Intransigence and a lack of flexibility have clearly alienated the ACP, especially when they realise that the Commission is pushing for agreements from the ACP that it has not sought from others, and colleagues from the Committee on International Trade will confirm this. Both technically and politically, the ‘goods-only’ agreement has proved impossible, even for the Caribbean. The capacity of the Caribbean is greater than of any other region. Only last week, they said that what was on offer was simply not tenable for them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Surely, the Commission must now step back, take the pressure off and reassess how it can ensure that we do not do the unthinkable and throw the non-LDCs to the wolves. The willingness of both sides to continue negotiation in good faith should be communicated to the WTO in order to avoid the trade disruption which failure to sign an EPA by the deadline would cause.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU must make the required internal legislative changes to permit the continuation of the current trading arrangements. Subsequently, the EU and the ACP could work together to ensure that there is no opposition or challenge in the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, as Members of the European Parliament, simply cannot return to our constituencies, wherever they are in Europe, and say that vulnerable ACP states are going to be treated in this way when they are already agreeing amongst themselves that they are being asked to agree economic partnerships that they see as being harmful to their economic interests.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to inform you of the serious concerns expressed in recent months by overseas communities in relation to EPAs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EPAs cannot amount to mere free trade agreements under the auspices of the WTO, nor can they jeopardise the already fragile economies of our overseas communities. They ought to represent a genuine partnership to create a new economic and trade framework favourable to development in all such territories. The geographic location of overseas communities in close proximity to many ACP countries places them at the centre of the preferential reciprocal agreements with these countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am well aware that the outermost regions and overseas countries and territories (OCTs) making up Europe’s overseas territory concern only six EU Member States and that obviously issues in these territories are largely unknown. Nevertheless, the particular situation of the outermost regions is known and must be taken into account much more specifically within these negotiations on the basis of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty. Additionally, OCTs next to ACP countries must also be given a special focus in terms of respect for the association agreements which already link them to the EU by virtue of this Article.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I thank you for supporting the amendment I intend to table in a bid to secure an intelligent balance between regional integration of overseas territories and their European links. Although negotiations may be difficult, particularly concerning protection of local markets and the list of sensitive products, I trust the Commission will find a respectful compromise between the specific interests of outermost regions and OCTs and of ACP countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that what will be important is to use the next few weeks to shape the agreement so that everyone can be happy with it. It is an agreement of great importance and it has immense symbolic resonance. It is not just about negotiating a free trade agreement for the regions and countries of Africa and bringing them closer to Europe. It is also about producing an agreement for a real development round, which fights poverty and genuinely shows that the European Union is in a position to negotiate an agreement in a way which puts the African countries at their ease and helps them feel a bond with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are several points which are important, as you yourself said, and you mentioned a number of them. We must ensure that the regional agreements genuinely benefit the countries concerned. We must ensure that the non-LCD countries also get an agreement and are not left out, and we must ensure that all the countries can develop in the right direction. The agreement which you proposed, in the form of a two-step approach, must also guarantee that no one is left out, so that ultimately, we are genuinely moving in the right direction, which is still not guaranteed today.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Markov, we should utilise the opportunity available to us now as a result of not adopting the resolution tomorrow, in order to reach a consensus in Parliament, and I think we have enough points of convergence for that to happen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank all who contributed to this interesting debate. I am sure that we see it as an ongoing process. I am not part of it directly or personally but, for an agreement, you need goodwill on both sides and for many partners to agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said in my introductory statement, we are working in a pragmatic and flexible way. Those who are ready or willing to follow the same approach follow not to the detriment of the others, but for the gradual achievement which is important for all regions and for international trade as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were some questions or criticisms about the tone of the negotiations. I want to assure you that it is in a spirit of partnership. We take into account, in this spirit of partnership, the development objectives and the constraints on our partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some questions were about goods-only deals. The stepping-stone agreements lead towards comprehensive EPAs and these are supportive of ACP development and regional integration. So we are not losing sight of the overall picture and overall needs of our partner countries and regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not want to repeat many of the points I made at the beginning, but the process continues. Sometimes a deadline brings pressure to find a solution during the last few days or weeks, and we are making real progress. I quoted many names and countries where we have recently initialled stepping-stone agreements, and we will continue doing so, but our interest is really in finding solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Processes will continue, because there is more than one stage in this situation. As I said, after 1 January, we will continue working on issues like services, investment and other trade-related areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the General Affairs and External Relations Council next week will support the proposal for a regulation of the Community to implement the market access which has been offered to the ACP. As I said, it is the best ever offer in a bilateral agreement. We are being not only open but also very constructive. The strategy the Commission proposed, and I tried to describe, was fully confirmed by the Council – all 27 countries – and, in this spirit of partnership and this constructive manner, we will continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective is really a fully-fledged economic partnership agreement. This will be a catalyst for regional integration. Once the first-step agreements are concluded, we will continue towards this objective. Nobody is left out or forgotten in this process. We not only have in mind, but support very actively, the least developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that is all I can say for now, either in response to questions or by way of confirmation, but I am sure that this House will come back to this point in the coming weeks and months, because this is also about the timing of our agreements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the adoption of the first two railway packages in 2001 and 2004 and before the adoption of the third railway package on 13 December 2006, the Commission proposed a new set of legislative measures on cross-acceptance of rolling stock, particularly locomotives. The aim of the measures is to revamp the rail sector by removing hindrances to the operation of trains on the European rail network.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission launched this initiative for two main reasons: to facilitate free movement of trains within the EU by making the procedure for placing locomotives in service more transparent and efficient, and also to simplify regulations by consolidating and merging the three rail interoperability directives into a single directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The full package contains a communication, three legislative proposals and their impact assessment: a communication setting out the current difficulties and proposing a number of solutions to simplify certification of railway vehicles; a proposal to recast the existing rail interoperability directives; a proposal to amend the Regulation establishing a European Railway Agency, and a report on the impact assessment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is the central focus of these texts? One crucial aspect is facilitating free movement of trains, and this concerns the procedure for approval of locomotives. According to railway companies and manufacturers, the approval procedure is extremely long and costly, and there would appear to be very little justification for a number of the authorities’ demands from the purely technical standpoint.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission shares this view and intends to solve the problem by amending the legislation and also by asking railway authorities in the Member States to modify their attitude, and hence the importance of the communication issued along with the legislative proposals, suggesting solutions that may be applied immediately with no need to wait for any amendments to laws. This communication has not been issued in vain. One cooperation agreement has already emerged, signed in May for the Rotterdam-Genoa corridor. This agreement follows the concepts proposed in our communication to the letter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We could also mention the proposed recast of the directives on interoperability and safety. The Commission had two objectives in mind when it drew up these proposals. The first was to simplify the approval procedure for railway vehicles. To this end we have introduced the principle of mutual recognition of authorisations for placing in service already issued by a Member State. This principle is that rolling stock which has already been granted authorisation for placing in service in one Member State will not require any further certification in another Member State beyond that required by additional national regulations arising out of the characteristics of the local network, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, in a bid for clarity, we have used a single text to combine the 1996 Directive on interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and the 2001 Directive on interoperability of the conventional rail system. In that regard, the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny has been introduced for certain powers delegated to the Commission by the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Amending the interoperability and safety directives prompted us to carry out two further operations. We have made a number of amendments to technical issues in the new interoperability directive in light of experience gained during ten years of work not only by the Commission but also by the Member States in relation to comitology, by industry and the sector and, as of 2005, by the European Railway Agency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also wanted to respond to other operators by clarifying, in the safety directive, relations between the railway company and the entity carrying out maintenance. The aim is, through this directive, to set out the new regulatory framework emerging from the Community directives on the opening up of the market and from the new contract on the use of wagons implemented on an international scale by the COTIF Convention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now I come to my final point on the proposal to amend the Regulation establishing a European Railway Agency. This concerns extending the powers of the European Railway Agency to allow it to compile the various national procedures and existing technical rules for authorisation of locomotives, and to draw up and subsequently extend the list of requirements to be verified once only, either because these are internationally recognised rules or because they may be considered as equivalent between the Member States. This task will be carried out in cooperation with national safety authorities under the guidance of the Agency. The Agency must issue technical opinions at the request of national safety authorities or the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While making these amendments, we also clarified a number of other points in the Regulation on the basis of past experience, particularly in relation to the introduction of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) and registers of rolling stock.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I apologise for this rather technical commentary, and wish to say that the first and second rail packages, and soon the third package also, form the legal and economic framework for sound operation of rail services within the single market. The operation will be completed by the opening up of national markets from the technical point of view. This is the objective of these proposals so eagerly awaited by the railway industry. I wish to thank Parliament for its splendid and rapid work on these texts.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though we are compelled to hold a ‘technical’ debate, as the Commission Vice-President has said, we are taking a major political step forward today.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ever since the first Treaty was drawn up in the late 1950s, European transport policy has had three goals: to create a single market, to connect networks which were separate from one another – so as to create a single market for and between modes of transport, of course – and to make networks interoperable at the construction stage. Interoperability is not a technical matter, therefore; it really is a precondition for establishing Europe-wide markets which are absolutely necessary and the stated aim of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">Major progress has been achieved in almost all respects, yet the railway sector lags behind somewhat. We find ourselves today with the same goals as those in the 1960s. The reasons are different, and this is not the time to explore them, but this point needs to be made in order to strengthen our conviction that we are taking a major step and that it is crucial for us to succeed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Interoperability is therefore a key condition for building, and being able to move around on, networks free from technical barriers which prevent full freedom of movement for engines and carriages. As such, it is a fundamental step that had to be taken and must be taken as rapidly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission was right to stop distinguishing between interoperability on high-speed networks and traditional networks, and hence to push as far as possible in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="it">It was also right to put the problem of safety on the table at the same time, since safety is sometimes presented – and I need to tread very carefully here – as a reason for attaching conditions to interoperability. How can an engine-driver be made to cross a border when he may not understand the language of the country to which he travels? How can a locomotive be made to cross a border when it might not be perfectly suited to the network on the other side? I could go on.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission therefore did well to bring the two elements together. We absolutely must guarantee safety, but within the bounds of a system that is interoperable, because if safety is put first as a condition for preventing interoperability, there is something amiss in this business. The very fact that it was decided to create a European Agency dealing with these matters and others, as we shall see, is undoubtedly a sign that we are taking things seriously.</p>
      <p sl="it">What has Parliament done? Parliament has broadly approved the Commission’s proposals, with a few recommendations intended to make the system more interoperable. In the report on interoperability, Parliament envisages setting deadlines by which authorisations should be granted, in relation to existing rolling stock, of course. It also advocates that the burden of proof of the fact that something is not interoperable – even on safety grounds – should be shifted onto Member States: in other words the initial assumption is that, once certified, everything can go everywhere, unless someone can give me a serious reason why that should not be the case. Thirdly, Parliament envisages that the retrofitting of all existing rolling stock should be eligible for state aid. Those, I believe, are the contributions made by this House.</p>
      <p sl="it">The same applies to safety. Here too, we have attempted to say that certification should be mandatory by a certain date: 2010 is our proposal. This should allay everyone’s fears, without exception, given that everyone is treated in similar fashion, rather than continuing to regard the monopolies still running railway services as automatically being particularly competent and therefore exempt from these obligations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The third point concerns getting the Agency up and running. On this point I have one key question on my mind, and I would address it to everyone, in particular the Commission. We quite rightly saw fit to separate out safety from everything else by creating 25 European agencies. That was a major decision taken some time ago. I now wonder, given that these agencies are not yet operational, whether it might not be worth considering whether to have one single European Agency working through 25 offshoots in the different countries. This is a fundamental issue and would help us find a positive solution to the allied problems of interoperability and safety at European level.</p>

    <intervention id="3-145" speaker_id="4377" name="Josu ORTUONDO LARREA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Spain" birth_date="13-02-1948" birth_place="Bilbao" p_group="Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe" m_state="ES">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, as a result of globalisation, our economy, the progress of the Community and the welfare of our citizens depend more than ever on an effective, efficient, economic and, above all, sustainable system of transport.</p>
      <p sl="es">All modes of transport are needed. The railways enjoyed glory days in the beginning, but were then pushed aside by vehicles travelling on roads and motorways, due to their greater versatility, individuality and accessibility. Now, with our roads at risk of collapse and our environment in a critical state due to pollution, we are once again looking at the railways as a hope for the future to meet our needs for domestic mobility.</p>
      <p sl="es">Aware of this, the Commission has proposed a new legislative package to improve the technical part of the regulatory framework for rail transport. This involves revising the directives on interoperability and safety and the Regulation on the European Railway Agency. In general terms, it was years ago that the European institutions first considered the need to consolidate the railways at Community level. Just on the issue of interoperability, everyone knows that, in July 1996, in other words 11 years ago, we adopted Council Directive 96/48/EC on the high-speed rail system followed, in March 2001, by the Directive on the trans-European conventional rail system.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, for more than a decade, the levels of interoperability of the European networks have not gone beyond 7% and it is the requirement for national approval of locomotives and traction units in each of the Member States where these are to be used that is currently one of the main barriers to the creation of new railway companies dedicated to the transport of passengers and freight, and also a major obstacle to the interoperability of the European railway system. As Member States cannot decide on their own that their authorisations for placing in service will be valid on the territory of other Member States, a Community initiative to simplify and harmonise national procedures and to encourage more systematic use of the principle of mutual recognition is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="es">The current directives regulate only new rolling stock placed in service. The new directive is intended to consolidate, recast and merge the current directives. For our part, based on brief technical reports that we requested in accordance with Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, we have proposed transferring to our Interoperability Directive the contents of the former Article 14 of the Safety Directive. This is specifically intended to give the rail sector greater legal certainty and enable the simplification of the authorisation for placing in service.</p>
      <p sl="es">We agree with the condition of there being at least one authorisation issued by one Member State for each vehicle. This authorisation will stem from compliance with the ‘EC’ declaration and with the applicable technical specifications on interoperability. Member States will consider as meeting the essential technical requirements those structural subsystems authorised to be placed into service in any other Member State and will not require any further authorisation, except where compatibility with infrastructure characteristics or limitations may be affected.</p>
      <p sl="es">In our report, we wanted to structure the various aspects and sections of the directive in a way more easily understandable to those concerned, by devoting a specific chapter to the requirements for placing vehicles into service, depending on whether this involves first or second authorisations or vehicles meeting all the TSIs (Technical Specifications of Interoperability) or only some of these.</p>
      <p sl="es">On all the aspects mentioned and throughout the whole procedure, we have remained in periodic contact with the shadow rapporteurs of the various political groups, the Commission and also the Council Presidency. We have finally been able to reach agreement, having resolved an important issue which was the maximum time limits for deciding on an authorisation, thus eradicating the well-known and paralysing administrative silence due to a lack of decision.</p>
      <p sl="es">Following a great deal of effort, we have agreed that authorisation will be automatic in the absence of a decision and we have also agreed on the rest of the articles. On behalf of this Parliament, we have therefore tabled a joint amendment, signed by all the parliamentary groups, which contains the same text that will be presented to the Council of Transport Ministers. I hope that the fact of having reached agreement at first reading will be beneficial to the whole sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">I want to end by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for their help and cooperation in achieving this objective.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to thank both rapporteurs very warmly for their good and constructive cooperation. I think we always succeeded in finding common ground on matters of substance, we were able to reach agreement very quickly and I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs for the way in which they managed to reach a deal so swiftly with the Council. After all, what benefit would a protracted dispute with the Council have brought? We could have lost a whole year! No, in my view, in spite of everything, we have managed to make progress on this matter at first reading and that is a great triumph for the House, the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would just like to focus on two or three points, and I am sure, Commissioner, you will pass this on to the European Railway Agency. We are giving the Agency greater responsibility for the setting of safety standards and interoperability criteria. I hope that the Agency will utilise these opportunities in the interests of our industry, that it will set new standards quickly, and that it will operate in an efficient and practical manner. As a passing comment, I also hope – and here I turn to Mr Costa if only he could hear me, he is on the phone, and phone calls are always more important – I hope that as more tasks are taken on by the European Railway Agency, the less the national agencies will have to get involved, and the less the national agencies have to do, the less bureaucracy there will be. If the bureaucracy works properly at European level, we will not need 25 national authorities. We want to save the European rail industry unnecessary overlap and duplication of work.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have a final comment for the Commissioner and the two rapporteurs: it is very important that we have reached an agreement. If the Member States miss their deadlines to decide on mutual recognition, then they are assumed to have given their authorisation. It is only through this authorisation function that we can exert the kind of pressure on national authorities that is needed to prevent them from constantly dragging their feet.</p>
      <p sl="de">Together, then, let us ensure that we save costs through cross-acceptance of locomotives and rolling stock, thereby increasing availability and giving further impetus to European rail freight in particular.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Vice-President Barrot, I must admit that I am torn today because my Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero, having appeared before this House, is now attending a reception at the Council. However, I have decided to remain here to listen to you and hopefully therefore to reinforce to some degree the Europeanisation of rail transport.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am delighted at the truth and the opportunity that have been presented to the European people by the Commission through an exercise which is really better law-making, involving the recasting of a series of old directives in order to produce a single text and make substantial progress in favour of the railways.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect, I congratulate Mr Ortuondo once again on his dedication and his almost punctilious tenacity in developing such a good legislative text. I must admit that I am also delighted at the excellent cooperation that there has been between all the groups in order to make progress on such an important issue as interoperability.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must also say that the best possible balance between safety and the need to advance courageously towards interoperability has been achieved. Safety is also absolutely guaranteed by the two reports produced by Mr Costa, also with great dedication.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Agency is improved and strengthened and its tasks and needs are also better defined. We also hope to be able to develop these more harmoniously in the future. European citizens must not therefore be afraid as rail safety has been Europeanised and therefore strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="es">The work on interoperability urgently needed to be completed as we must first Europeanise rail transport and then improve convenience and logistics, bearing in mind that we also now have a new text on dedicated routes that will make interoperability even more essential.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Mr Costa has said, progress needed to be made in terms of realising the ambitions of the legislator, in other words Parliament and the Council, with regard to allowing trains to circulate freely. I believe we have managed to create the conditions to minimise the ever-present legal uncertainty which was why all the issues of mutual recognition of authorisations for rolling stock and locomotives constantly kept running into barriers and obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we have even made clear who, how and when these must be recognised. We have even given a bit of a push, through the progress made on administrative silence …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate may certainly seem quite technical to our fellow citizens. It certainly is technical, although the harmonisation of rail safety and interoperability rules constitutes one of their major concerns as they go about their daily lives. I recall, for instance, the terrible accident a few months ago in Zoufftgen, between Luxembourg and France, which shocked us all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we wish to find a solution to the challenges ahead, particularly climate change, if we wish to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and bring about the modal shift, in other words reduce road freight services in favour of other means of transport causing less pollution, we must remove some of the present technical barriers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To create a genuine European rail space, we must either harmonise Technical Specifications of Interoperability or introduce mutual recognition of standards. The current procedures for national approvals of rolling stock are too long and costly. We must facilitate administrative procedures, reduce time-limits and do all we can to harmonise national safety regulations, which sometimes lead to major traffic restrictions for no good reason.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish, of course, to offer my warmest thanks to our rapporteurs, Paolo Costa and Josu Ortuondo Larrea, for their splendid work, especially since this seems to satisfy all our political groups and it would seem, I hope, that we are heading for an agreement with the Council at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to make three quick observations. First of all, as all my colleagues have said, I am pleased we have achieved greater readability. The provisions in relation to authorisation will be grouped within a single legislative document, the Interoperability Directive, for both the trans-European high-speed rail system and the conventional system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second observation: I am also extremely glad that a number of principles, rather technical a priori but nevertheless very important in this case, have been adopted in relation to approval; particularly cross-acceptance of rolling stock except in the event of specific characteristics of the local network, the obligation for the national authorities to demonstrate the actual safety risks, and the role of the Agency in the compilation and classification of national rules for clarification purposes. Here I also feel it is important that the Agency avail itself of expert advice from network managers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also pleased with the principle of implicit authorisation in the absence of a decision by national authorities within three months but, on the time-limits laid down for holding the keeper responsible, I wish to state a clear reservation because I fear this could remove responsibility from the rail company.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in amending the Directive on safety of the Community’s railways, it is important to support efforts aimed at creating a common market for rail transport services. That is why a common framework for regulating railway safety must be established.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission should be authorised to adjust and adopt common safety measures and common safety targets. It should also be authorised to introduce a single certification system. To that end, existing requirements should first be checked, together with current safety conditions in Member States so as to establish whether the current safety level of the railway system has not been eroded in any Member State. Priority areas where safety needs to be improved further should be identified too. A safety certificate should constitute an assurance that the railway undertaking has put in place a safety management system covering the provision of transport services on the European network.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Items of rolling stock authorised to be placed into service in a given Member State must be covered by this authorisation in other Member States, if indeed the latter require such authorisation. The directive in question states that whenever rolling stock is authorised to enter into service a legal entity responsible for its maintenance must be appointed. That is very important. The entity in question could be a railway undertaking, a sub-contractor or the owner of the rolling stock. This measure responds to the expectations of the market in services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The initiative before us will ensure that rail transport becomes more competitive and will allow jobs in the sector to be saved. Amendments to this directive have been eagerly awaited, especially in the new Member States. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Vice-President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, with these three reports, the convergence of the European rail network will take a massive step forward. Safety standards will be harmonised and monitored in future by the European Railway Agency. Mutual recognition of railway vehicles within the EU Member States, which is long overdue, will be ensured. That being the case, I would like to express my warm thanks to the two rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, for without this good cooperation, we would not have achieved this result.</p>
      <p sl="de">The difficult times are finally over. In order to be able to operate a locomotive which was licensed in another Member State, it often took three years and could cost up to EUR 10 million. This was provocative and to the detriment of environmentally friendly rail transport long before the EU had 27 Members. In future, the authorisation of a railway vehicle will apply in all 27 Member States of the EU unless, within three months, a Member State raises an objection and justifies why the operation of the vehicle is not possible on safety grounds. Its operation cannot be prevented for trivial reasons such as the colour of a fire extinguisher or the size of the wing mirror. The burden of proof will thus be reversed. In the past, manufacturers had to carry out a great deal of painstaking work to demonstrate that there were no grounds for concern, but in future, a good case must be presented for any safety concerns, and it is the European Railway Agency – whose powers will be enlarged – which will decide whether these concerns are justified.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the three-month deadline passes without any objections, the authorisation applies to the EU’s entire rail network. This means that railway vehicles can be manufactured in greater numbers and at lower cost. Germany’s Federal Railway Administration, in particular, resisted the curtailment of its powers to the very end. It is thanks to the persistence of all the groups in this House that a viable compromise has been reached and that Josu Ortuondo Larrea’s report can now be adopted by consensus at first reading by the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, following the rejoicing over the unanimous support for these three reports by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to wind up the discussion with two critical observations: the European Railway Agency can fulfil the useful task of further developing and applying the new European Rail Traffic Management System and reducing its dependence on manufacturers. But the Agency is especially needed in other areas due to the increasingly large scale of operations, liberalisation and competition on the tracks. These developments necessitate more and more bureaucracy to make it possible to coordinate everything properly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Long before the creation of the European Union, that coordination happened differently. There were good agreements between national railway companies, which organised train connections together over long distances, together with the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits. I doubt whether the new model is an improvement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">From now on, any railway vehicle which is approved in principle in one Member State will automatically be accepted in other Member States. Such a situation does not even exist yet on a small scale between town tram companies; this is because the sharpness of the bends, the location of stops and sometimes the distance between two tracks mean that some trams cannot travel every route. I expect too that the railway companies will frequently appeal for possible exceptions on the basis of security. In practice, therefore, very little will change.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Commission’s Interoperability Directive admits that it is about enabling ‘citizens of the Union … to benefit to the full from the advantages deriving from the establishing of an area without … frontiers.’ This vision is a burden to the UK because many of the EU population buy only one-way tickets.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that isolated, narrow-gauged and preserved railways will be exempt. But what about secondary rail routes? Presumably, all this extra paperwork allows Luxembourgers, Latvians and Lithuanians to line up and run services from Long Eaton to Letchworth.</p>

Current Portuguese locos would come off the track before the Channel Tunnel, as the rails in France are too narrow.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, with a view to achieving interoperable railway networks and ensuring a high level of sustainable mobility for our citizens, as well as efficient connections between EU regions, we should undoubtedly welcome the simplification of the current regulatory framework sought by the Costa and Ortuondo Larrea reports. I should like to take this opportunity to thank both colleagues for their excellent work, especially given the strategic importance of interoperability, the indispensable need for safety and the need to establish the European Railway Agency with an extended mandate.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is undoubtedly a good idea too, for the reasons given, to improve the technical part of the regulatory framework and promote the cross-acceptance of rolling stock. The new procedure will thus be based on the principle of mutual cross-acceptance of authorisations already granted by a Member State, for which the necessary additional certification will be little more than a pro forma.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is all very well, then, but all rolling stock absolutely has to be in decent condition: not only rolling stock which moves from one country to another, but also that which travels on local networks. Railway users in Italy suffer obvious discrimination, since the most obsolete and often defective rolling stock is used on Italy’s local network, at least by comparison with standards in many other EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">If the Commission could investigate further, it would ascertain huge differences in the service provided. As I have pointed out on previous occasions, the Italian railways provide an altogether unsatisfactory service, especially as regards local transport.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason among others, I believe that the responsibilities of railway companies and owners should be more clearly defined with respect to safety, and also as concerns compliance with social standards and standards of service to users.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I firstly want to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work on the various reports which represent another step towards the integration of the European railways.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are faced with the challenge of developing a competitive, profitable, sustainable and safe European railway system, in other words a true alternative to other modes of transport, thus enabling a modal shift.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the European railway system currently still suffers from many problems which have not yet been solved. We can travel by train from Madrid to Berlin but, unfortunately, this journey, in a Europe in which we do have a single currency and an internal market, would be a real epic as we lack an integrated rail system.</p>
      <p sl="es">The differences in track width between certain countries, the lack of standardisation and technological harmonisation of rolling stock and signalling systems, the disparities in training and certification of locomotive drivers and the insuperable difference in voltages supplying the tracks all make rail transport less competitive and work against the very reason why trans-European transport networks were planned, in other words to achieve a truly internal market in transport thus enabling more European construction.</p>
      <p sl="es">Please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to raise with you and the Commissioner, albeit briefly, the well-known and serious problem that is threatening the connection between the Iberian Peninsula and the European rail network, particularly in the Mediterranean area. This is not just a Spanish or French issue, it is a European issue. Commissioner, if the work on this line is not speeded up, we will not, in the medium term, be able to overcome the almost insuperable orographical obstacle of the Pyrenees.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect, I want to call on the European Commission and the Commissioner to urge the Spanish and French Governments to solve this problem with a view to achieving a truly European rail system. I know that things are difficult at the moment in Spain because a minister is being questioned and the government is a lame duck, but there will soon be another government and, with this, a new hope.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the conditions under which the economy operates are constantly changing. As a result, ongoing changes in many sectors are required, and we are today concerned with changes in the operation of railways, and in particular with the safety of their operation. Accordingly, the relevant provisions need to be systematically brought into line with the current situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Many changes have taken place recently. These include the enlargement of the Schengen Area to admit a number of countries whose railway systems vary considerably where technical conditions are concerned. In addition, railway monopolies have been done away with in many countries and undertakings owning the network have arisen, along with regional and international transport undertakings. This all calls for tightening up of the definitions and principles of procedure related to ensuring security on the territory of the Union. The situation will largely be resolved by amending national provisions to take account of developments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposals contained in the report by Mr Costa represent added value in this regard. Mr Costa has proposed changes aimed at simplification, such as transferring Article 14 of Annex VII to the directive on interoperability. This will significantly improve the readability of the directive. Establishing clearer responsibility for safety is fundamental. I should like to thank Mr Costa for all the work he has done preparing the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in relation to this apparently technical issue of interoperability of the European railway system and the role of the European Railway Agency in terms of safety, we find ourselves at the heart of a genuine choice between civilisations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Either the EU implements a European railway market based on competition of ‘everyone against everyone else’ and the dismembering of national railway companies in the vague hope of retaining the proper safety levels – this is what the Commission’s proposals mean – or we make arrangements for cooperation between all the Member State rail companies to implement a network throughout the EU to transport passengers and freight at high speed in all safety. The latter could be achieved by developing the Railteam alliance, bringing together the main European high-speed operators.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should note that European railway history has already made a decision between the two systems. Great Britain implemented the choices that the Commission is now proposing on its own rail network ten years ago. The result: a general deterioration in the service, and a deterioration in safety leading to fatal accidents. On the other hand, ten years ago Thalys was set up on the basis of cooperation between the SNCF and the SNCB, despite opposition by the Commission. The result: an efficient, safe, quality service in response to passengers’ needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the strength of this historical experience, I wish to ask the Commission to abandon its choice of railway competition in favour of cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has much to offer to help all of us make our lives and our economies better. Unfortunately, almost all these good intentions have names which are difficult to pronounce.</p>
      <p sl="de">This applies especially to one of the priorities in today’s railway package. Interoperability is the magic word which describes what we want and what we must achieve if we are genuinely to have a functioning railway system in Europe. Locomotives and other rolling stock must be aligned with each other, but for that, we need authorisation procedures which are interlinked.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has presented a relevant proposal which we have developed further in Parliament in a consensus between all the political families. We hope that, along with the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) and other things, this will help us achieve a better-coordinated rail system for a single Europe. Our system is based on the concept and principle of mutual recognition and technical harmonisation, sets clear deadlines and criteria for authorisations, and requires – and this is very important – that, in the event of an application for authorisation being rejected, the national safety authority must prove that there is a risk to safety, not the other way around.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we want, and what we hope to achieve, is that many of the tasks which have been transferred to the European Railway Agency in this context will be carried out by that Agency as quickly and purposefully as possible. My hope is that, as my colleague Georg Jarzembowski has said, during and at the end of the process, there will be less bureaucracy here in our single Europe than is currently the case. We are confident that our proposals can secure broad consensus in the House at the vote, so that the tangible outcome will indeed be more interoperability.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Costa, for their splendid work within a very short space of time on a rather technical issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning the proposal to recast the rail interoperability directives, I see that an agreement at first reading is within reach. This has been achieved as a result of several working sessions and I wish to congratulate Mr Ortuondo Larrea in particular for his personal undertaking to see this proposal through. It was important to establish a precise detailed procedure for certifying locomotives and other railway vehicles in relation to possible action by national safety authorities, and to simultaneously impose a ceiling on the maximum time-limit for the certification procedure, as Mr Jarzembowski said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The result of the negotiations to which the Commission has made a technical contribution is an amendment which completely remodels the text of the directive, and with which the Commission agrees entirely. Thus, Mr President, if this agreement is confirmed, we will be sending out a firm political signal to industry and the national safety authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is now up to the national safety authorities to make the approval procedures for railway vehicles less expensive and more rapid. We will also be adopting this legislation in record time, showing that European laws can move at the same speed as the TGV.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to reply to Chairman Costa in relation to the national safety authorities. These were created in response to the 2004 Railway Safety Directive. For most of the Member States, this meant creating a new authority from scratch, with all the budget and recruitment difficulties this entailed. It would be a rather difficult task, Mr Chairman, to take away a function from these authorities which has only just been allocated to them, and this would also cast doubts on the credibility of our railway policy. I agree with you, however. In the long term, we can imagine that one day there will be more extensive Europeanisation of this device. I wished to give you a reply on that point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now come to the issue of safety, where you acted as rapporteur. As you wished, a portion of these directives has been transferred to the new interoperability directive. With the exception of compliance with the new comitology decision through the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the only remaining major component of this proposal is the issue of railway vehicle maintenance and the role of vehicle keepers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More than half the amendments tabled are acceptable to the Commission as they are in principle or in part. However, I must mention the situation of Amendment 21. On this rather technical issue, any amendments envisaged must comply with the legislation already in force, particularly the Safety Directive, but also the Technical Specification of Interoperability for wagons that entered into force on 31 January 2007 and the decision on the national vehicle register that entered into force on 9 November 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These amendments must also be line, as far as possible, with the various situations that may be encountered in practice. They must bear a close relationship to the practices in force in other modes of transport. They must not enshrine in legislation a contractual commercial model that may evolve along with the reform of the railway system. That is why Amendment 21 does not meet with the approval of the Commission. The same is true, Mr President, with Amendments 3 to 7, 10, 14, 17 and 22, essentially for purely technical or judicial reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to finish with some remarks on the proposed amendment to the Regulation establishing the European Railway Agency. Since the new functions assigned to the European Railway Agency basically depend on the interoperability and safety directives and the driver certification directive, the text should not pose any major problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In relation to Amendment 4, where you want the Agency to act as the national authorities’ certifier, I am pleased that a reasonable compromise has been found in relation to Mr Ortuondo Larrea’s report. In the long term, the Agency could take on that responsibility, but at the present time experts agree that this kind of reorganisation would be premature. The potential models for cooperation between the European Railway Agency and national safety authorities must be examined. The Commission has undertaken to assess the impact of all these options to allow the best decision to be taken by 2015.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The other amendments are acceptable as they are, either in part or in principle, with the exception of three. Firstly, Amendment 5 grants the Agency a mediation role in problems with the issue of safety certificates. We do not agree with this amendment for the reasons already stated. Secondly, we do not accept Amendment 6 for reasons of coherence with the corresponding article in the Railway Safety Directive. Finally, we do not accept Amendment 8, since this would bring the Agency in as an adviser on commercial projects, whereas this task corresponds to a Community body.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have listened carefully to all the speeches today. I feel that in the main the European Parliament has properly gauged the value of these provisions which are set to truly Europeanise our railways. I do not intend to answer all the questions posed. I simply wish to state that we have allocated 85% of funds for railway projects to the trans-European networks. I wish to tell Mr de Grandes Pascual that we have not neglected mountain routes, particularly the Pyrenees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also wish to say that, whatever approach is taken to the railway system, we must nevertheless admit that, if we want trains to make a comeback in Europe, we must make a genuine effort to Europeanise the system through technical interoperability and harmonised safety regulations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the year 2007 will be a key year for rail transport. As of 1 January national and international freight transport has been open to competition. We are seeing that the revitalisation process in this sector is beginning to bear fruit. The railways’ market share, following a decline since 1970 in most of the Member States, has now stabilised and is in fact growing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The legislative proposals you are discussing here today will help railway companies compete with road traffic. I am therefore extremely pleased with the agreement on the interoperability directive, and the Commission will do all it can to bring about a rapid agreement on the other two aspects of these measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, please allow me to express my most sincere gratitude to all the Members who made a sustained effort on such a technical item. I feel this has helped us to make much more rapid progress since, had we been compelled to contemplate a second reading, we would have lost one precious year. Thus I feel that 2007 will be a good year for rail transport, and this also makes it a good year for the fight against global warming, in which we know rail transport may be particularly useful.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Commission’s proposal to improve legislation in the field of interoperability is welcomed, taking into consideration the need to improve the rail transport system in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">National procedures for the certification of locomotives and rolling stock, as well as those for certification of locomotive engineers, are very different, actually preventing the free movement of trains on the Union’s territory.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is extremely important for the regulations on interoperability to be extended to the entire Community railway network. TENs are already designed on the principle of interoperability and, therefore, investments should focus on the normal railways and on all categories of rolling stock, in order to make them reach the European common standards in the future.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Interoperability is a requirement, but there are also regions of the European area where no railways compatible with high-speed trains can be built: mountain regions, isolated regions in general, railways going through tunnels and viaducts.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe the lawmaker should issue specific provisions because, on the one hand, we cannot deprive these regions of the benefits of rail transport and, on the other hand, we cannot ignore the conditions for the safety of passengers, trains and infrastructures themselves.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The national railway safety rules imposed by the Member States are essential for the railway systems to meet safety requirements and for their interoperability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Upon putting into operation any rolling stock, a legal entity in charge with its maintenance shall be appointed. I believe technical specifications should indicate the basic parameters and the technical characteristics required for the maintenance of components, subassemblies or assemblies incorporated or designed to be incorporated in a railway subsystem.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Speed restrictions are imposed on 66% of the Romanian railways due to the condition of the railway infrastructure, and 77% of the rolling stock is worn out. Romania has to invest in the development of railway transport. I consider it extremely important for Romania and Bulgaria to be rapidly connected to the system of high-speed rail transport.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing a pre-negotiated common position of Parliament and the Council on the revision of the Directive concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities. We can view this as a great success for Parliament, the Council and the Commission, so I would like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to my parliamentary colleagues from all political groups and from all the committees involved, especially the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Culture and Education, Henri Weber, Ignasi Guardans Cambó and Helga Trüpel. They have done much to make it possible for us to present a success, a joint result, today.</p>
      <p sl="de">My thanks also go to Commissioner Reding – Commissioner of the Year 2007, congratulations! – who tabled the proposal for the revision of the Directive with great resolution and willingness to cooperate, in equal measure, and worked on it with us.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank the Council, specifically the German Presidency, under whose leadership it proved possible to achieve the common position, and the current Portuguese Presidency, which stalwartly defended the common position achieved, thereby enabling us to debate it today and vote on it tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">‘Television without frontiers’ is crucial for freedom of information and pluralism of the media in Europe. We therefore greatly welcome the fact that we have been able to update this Directive just in time. On the basis of the country of origin principle, we have achieved joint objectives for traditional and new forms of television, regardless of platform. For traditional TV, this mainly encompasses the right to short-term reporting Europe-wide, safeguards on better access for the disabled, better controls on advertising aimed at children, and independent national media supervision.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we have also improved the financial bases for commercial broadcasting, not by increasing advertising – that still stands at a maximum of 12 minutes per hour – but by introducing more flexible rules. We have taken the difficult step of allowing product placement so that private TV broadcasters, in competition with Google and other rivals, will be able to offer free-to-air TV services in future. It was the European Parliament which worked to achieve adequate transparency directives here.</p>
      <p sl="de">For modern TV on the Internet, the principle which will apply after tomorrow’s decision and its ensuing implementation at national level is that TV will remain an economic and cultural product regardless of the technology used. That is the European model which we have safeguarded with this Directive for audiovisual media services, as it will be known in future. TV on the internet and mobile TV should also have a future in Europe, not only as an economic product but also as a core guarantee of freedom of information and media pluralism.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is so important to have initiated this modernised Directive just in time. ‘Just in time’ means that the forthcoming negotiations on the telecoms package, which have now begun, as well as the deliberations on online content can take place against the backdrop of this clarified legal framework for traditional and new audiovisual media services.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I would ask you for your support in tomorrow’s vote so that we secure a broad majority in favour of progress in our European media policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is always a great satisfaction for a mother to see the child she brought into the world grow up into an intelligent lively teenager. This is how I feel this evening about our audiovisual media services ‘without frontiers’ directive, a feeling of satisfaction and pride I wish to share with the child’s godmother, our excellent rapporteur Ruth Hieronymi.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are many ways of testing a child’s intelligence. Mrs Hieronymi has listed them: a scope adapted to future audiovisual means, since it has been broadened to audiovisual media on demand such as VOD (video on demand); reaffirmation of the principle of the country of establishment, and thus consolidation of freedom of movement of programmes, adding in an intelligent cooperation and dialogue procedure to prevent or settle any potential conflict; a balance between respect for consumers and additional freedom for our businesses; enhancement of the right to information with the new rules on access to short extracts of key events. All these new features, and more, I feel go to prove an intelligent balance between renewal and respect for values.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As testimony to the child’s vitality, I wish to point to promotion of cultural diversity in the digital field, acknowledgement of new advertising techniques, a legal framework finally provided for product placement, attention finally paid to access to audiovisual media for our fellow citizens with visual or hearing disabilities, and the trust placed in the industry by arrangements to apply the directive using self-regulation or co-regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament played a major role in bringing the child to adolescence, and I wish to express my gratitude. This is another example of splendid cooperation between the three institutions which have successfully completed legislation that will form an essential basis for the industry and the culture of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is now time for the child to leave the nest and spread its wings as an adult. In the case of a Community directive, this means transposition by the Member States. In keeping with EU policy, I do hope this stage does not make the child obese. It would be all the more paradoxical as, in the new directive, we call on industry to draw up codes of good conduct on advertising aimed at children that leads to obesity. Therefore I hope that, as far as possible, the Member States will refrain from adding national obligations to the detriment of their audiovisual industry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am absolutely sure that the text to be submitted for your approval tomorrow will provide genuine legal security in the industry, and will also promote our values of society and culture. With this legal framework, the EU is moving ahead of legislation on other continents. I think we can be proud of it. We are also helping our industries in terms of creation. We are making a contribution to the best possible financing scheme for our films and to access for Europeans to premium content schedules on free television networks: so it is this evening that, with you and thanks to you, I have the feeling that our mission has been accomplished.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, first of all let me congratulate and thank our rapporteur for her work on this matter, as also the Commissioner. This is a question on which there are many different and very strong views, yet we have produced a proposal which we are discussing here this evening and which points the way forward for European television.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There are a few things that I think are important to emphasise. Among other things, we establish the principle of country of origin legislation, which means a better and stronger basis for diversity but also for common European television and – an important point – better conditions for a European film industry, since that is a closely related issue. It also means better scope for free media to exist across Europe’s borders.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Of course certain things could have been even better. I myself thought it would have been good if we had had greater openness on the matter of advertising time, but more flexibility is created here. I think that the proposal which has now come back on the matter of product placement also amounts to an improvement. We therefore have reason to be satisfied with the progress which has been made.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let me just say one thing regarding the future, since this legislation is based extensively on the existence of a difference between what are called linear and non-linear media services. I think that the difference will play less and less of a role in future. It is already apparent now that this difference is not so great or so relevant. I think that it will be important to follow developments in this field, so that we do not end up with a situation in which traditional TV media in Europe are in a less favourable position than those which broadcast in non-linear ways, via the Internet or by other means, because in the long term that can damage our chances in the global context. Once again I would like to thank the rapporteur and to note that we have taken a step forward.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by quoting my colleague Henri Weber. This text is an acceptable compromise for the Socialist Group and, during the negotiations, we succeeded in adding some valuable provisions to preserve the European audiovisual model. I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, for her determination, patience and also a particularly open and positive spirit of compromise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Certain issues in relation to the digital revolution within the context of the knowledge economy made this review necessary. The rules have been extended, in an appropriate manner, to the new audiovisual services. Protection of minors is guaranteed, as is the protection of EU citizens from incitement to all discrimination. These new services shall contribute to the financing of films and the European audiovisual component. A percentage of their turnover will be paid into support accounts, and there will be guaranteed exposure of European productions in on-line catalogues. Pluralism in the media has now become an official requirement. The role of the regulatory authorities has been enhanced, and the adoption of provisions in relation to accessibility for all is recommended most strongly to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of advertising, the Socialist Group wanted to retain the rules of the current Directive. With advertising limited to 20% per hour, the duration between two advertising screens is now 30 minutes, whereas we wanted to retain 45 minutes for European screens. We are nonetheless satisfied that product advertising is banned during documentaries, information broadcasts and children’s programmes. The Member States may, however, choose to allow this kind of advertising for films, television fiction and sports broadcasts. In this case there are strict regulations for product placement in order to prevent abuse and certain perverse effects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A balance has therefore been found between freedom of expression, circulation of information, public access to new services such as VOD (video on demand), and content with a cultural and economic value. The emphasis on quality will allow European production to strengthen its position. This is one of the major effects of the directive.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I feel we have reached the end of a very long journey. It has taken us a long time and has involved the efforts of many people, many Members and many experts, even people who followed this debate very closely outside the House because it was so important to them. We should all feel very pleased with ourselves because tomorrow, barring any surprises, the text arising from all these negotiations and debates will be unanimously adopted, perhaps even without a vote, the real test that such a text may be adopted almost by acclaim.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The time has therefore come to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi and the other shadow rapporteurs, but especially Mrs Hieronymi and, I must say, the Commissioner as well. She says she feels the mission has been accomplished. She is right. She really can feel that way today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This means we will be adopting a very clear legal framework with clear rules that will make investment in audiovisual means more secure and certain. The rules will be extendable to new digital media and to new means linked to new media, with all the essential features required for consumer protection and protection of minors, without simultaneously overlapping or simply amplifying the existing provisions, for the means are new and the legal responses must also be new.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new rules certainly make advertising more flexible. We are aware of this. We debated them and we gave them our support. By and large it was my Group that worked hardest to ensure this text finally came through, because we have not denaturalised the European audiovisual model. We never actually went that far, but we know – and we ought to say this out loud because we also supported product placement, and we did it in all conscience – that if we want free television for viewers, although this is never free, but it is for the viewers, and if we do not want this kind of free television to be paid for only through taxation and public finance, there must be means of finance within a framework of competition. This, then, is the context in which we have authorised product placement. We have made it transparent and we have made it very clear how and when it ought to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is now time to make arrangements for implementation. Here I would ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities again. It is true that the child has flown the nest, but not completely. Implementation must be monitored very closely, and in particular, Commissioner, something must be done in relation to one aspect where I have serious concerns. I think there is a general feeling in certain Member States that there are now no regulations for European television between now and the time of implementation. There are no laws any more, we might say. This, however, is not true. The Television Without Frontiers Directive, which is still valid, laid down advertising rules, and the rules set out what could be done and what could not be done. There is a general feeling that, until the new regulation, until the new directive is applied in the Member States, the rules already in force are not applicable. Here it is your responsibility and that of the Commission to make it clear that this perception is incorrect, and this is not the way in which the situation ought to be viewed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the amendments to the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities aim to ensure that recipients of audiovisual media services in Member States can take full advantage of the benefits of the internal market by implementing the principles of regulation according to country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Amendment of the Directive will bring the European Union’s provisions into line with the most recent technological advances. The European Commission’s proposal distinguishes between linear services, namely transmission through traditional television, internet or mobile television that delivers material to the viewer constantly pursuant to an ongoing programme, and non-linear services similar to television downloaded from the network on demand.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Retaining the so-called Television Without Frontiers Directive in its current form would aggravate the unjustified differences in the regulatory treatment of different methods of distributing similar or identical media content. The current provisions regarding television should remain in force for linear services. For non-linear services, however, minimal essential provisions should be established. These could, for instance, concern the protection of minors, a ban on incitement to racial hatred, and a ban on surreptitious advertising. This is all provided for in the proposed changes. The Union of the Europe of the Nations Group will therefore vote in favour of the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in our renewed deliberations on the new version of the Directive concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, henceforth to be known as the ‘Audiovisual Media Services Directive’, we have constantly conducted a cultural policy debate as well, concerning cultural diversity and maintaining quality in TV broadcasting. With Parliament’s final decision, the legislative process is really just starting, so we are already looking ahead.</p>
      <p sl="de">I urge the Member States to make use of the subsidiarity principle enshrined in the Directive and fully exploit the scope for more cultural and media diversity. This applies especially to more rights for independent producers, the contribution of non-linear services such as video-on-demand providers in support of European productions, and limiting the scope for product placement. Public broadcasting in Europe, in particular, should do without product placement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Throughout the work on the new version of the Directive, we had a dispute over matters of fundamental principle. This focused on how much market liberalisation we want and where, precisely, we intend to regulate. From the Greens’ perspective, this dispute has been resolved in favour of more market-oriented liberalisation, especially advertising. Our Group will therefore not support the new version of the Directive in tomorrow’s vote. The numerous new opportunities for even more advertising – whether in sports programmes, series or feature films – will result in a loss of quality in Europe’s media. Public broadcasting will therefore play an even more important role in future, and national legislators must enable it to fulfil its mandate to inform and educate as comprehensively as possible, also via new media such as mobile or Internet TV. That is why, also when dealing with the new version of the Telecommunications Directive, we need to establish an appropriate framework at European level, if broadcasting is in future to be received to a greater extent via mobile phones or the Internet.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the compromise which Ruth Hieronymi – of course with help from her colleagues – has devised here is one which I can wholeheartedly support. I really would like to thank her very warmly; this was a very difficult piece of work and she has done a marvellous job. In my view, the compromise covers most of what we wanted to achieve at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="de">As we know, the rapid pace of technological development had rendered the old Directive obsolete. I myself worked on this first Directive. We now have something new: new transmission opportunities, new services ‘on demand’ alongside traditional TV, so we need this new directive. For me, it was important in this context to uphold the country of origin principle and maintain short-term reporting. More flexible regulations on advertising have been introduced, but I believe that maintaining a maximum of 12 minutes per hour is the right thing to do. As before, cinematographic works and news programmes will not be interrupted.</p>
      <p sl="de">One sticking point, as you know, Commissioner, was product placement. Many of us voted for the present compromise with a heavy heart. What is positive, however, is that the ban comes first, followed by the exemptions which have already been mentioned here. I think that if these are correctly applied, we will not have any American-style conditions. The restriction on advertising in children’s programmes is also something which I welcome. This compromise enables the audiovisual sector to face up to the major changes taking place and adapt to technological and market conditions. The compromise helps the audiovisual sector to become more competitive in future. This compromise is, at the moment, the best balance between media pluralism and cultural diversity, and offers the opportunity to develop a more competitive European audiovisual industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once again, may I express my warm thanks to the Commissioner but especially our colleague Ruth Hieronymi.</p>

It is a considerable step forward for the European audiovisual industry, and I can only rejoice in this along with all the speakers who have said so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A question was asked: what will happen between now and actual implementation of the new directive? I am able to reassure the Member on this point. We will continue to apply the rules of the Television Without Frontiers Directive. In fact, I have just initiated infringement proceedings against Spain for exceeding advertising time. The same will apply to all Member States who do not play by the rules: until we have new rules, the old rules are still the rule.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I wish to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi and Mr Guardans for their splendid dialogue with the Members and for the quality of the reports that they drew up with the Council which have led to the presentation of this extremely consensual report at second reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council has accepted a large number of Parliament’s requests and all the requests of my political group.

      <p sl="fr">Parliament has shown that it was able to conduct negotiations with the Council, with these having produced a much more elaborate text than before.

      <p sl="hu">The new regulation for borderless television has had uneven success. It is pleasing that we are creating legal bases for digital and non-linear television. It is already the eleventh hour, due to the rapid development of technology. I feel it is very important that the public service television stations that broadcast the values of the Community should make use of the opportunities provided by the new technologies. If public service broadcasters cannot keep pace with commercial channels with regard to technological quality, then it is to be feared that they will lose the viewers they have had up to now, and their cultural, public-life and other quality programmes will not reach younger generations. The final version thoroughly softens the rules on advertising. It is particularly annoying that we have not managed to ban the crafty increase of volume in advertising either, even though our electorate throughout Europe deplores this practice. It is also saddening that even children’s programmes can be interrupted by adverts. The product placement regulation is a sober compromise. The legislation does not bring about many of the objectives of the European Parliament, but if it were not created the lack of regulation would presumably be even more problematic.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the Council’s common position, which brings some significant changes regarding the protection of children and minors, the access of disabled persons to audiovisual services and the placing of advertising products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Spot announcements for alcohol and tobacco are perceived by young people as a way of being socially accepted among adults and these vices are correlated with physical attraction, fun, adventure and recreation. Moreover, intensive advertising, especially addressed to children, for food products and beverages with a content high in fats and sugar undermines the positive initiatives for public health protection, such as nutrition education and correct labeling of products. The European Union is dealing with an obesity crisis and television aggravates this problem. In Spain, 48% of the advertising during children programmes is for sweets, fast-food products and crisps, and in Great Britain, food products high in fats and sugar represent 80 and 90% of the TV advertising.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Council’s text lays an emphasis on the development of codes of conduct related to “junk food” advertising to children, as well as on introducing filter systems and PIN codes that will increase the protection of minors from the negative influence of audiovisual services and will play an important role in the fight against obesity.</p>

Please listen carefully and free from any fear: ‘whereas the’ Russian ‘public is not sufficiently informed about the extent of the crimes committed in the’ Second World War, ‘most notably in’ Finland, the Baltic States, Katyń and the Königsberg region; Parliament ‘believes that the citizens of’ Russia ‘are entitled to be told the truth about the … policies of war and genocide committed in their name and to have knowledge of the perpetrators of war crimes’; Parliament ‘believes that’ Russia ‘must honestly confront its’ Soviet ‘past in order to progress and that coming to terms with the past is an integral part of the road to reconciliation with’ Russia’s ‘neighbours’.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the situation of European Roma, in connection with our opinion, which was adopted at the last plenary session. I feel it is essential that the European Commission and the Parliament should work side by side and take responsibility for this minority, assuming a much more emphatic role than they have done up to now, and preparing, implementing and monitoring programmes aimed at the inclusion of social groups that have been excluded and marginalised. As part of this, it would be very important for the Members of the European Parliament work side by side with the Commissioners who are directly or indirectly responsible for minorities, their integration and their inclusion and, as a specialist group, jointly to prepare a comprehensive, cross-border Roma strategy with effective monitoring, which would provide an opportunity for those who live in the most deprived areas and for the groups in the most disadvantaged situations to have access to the Union’s development programmes. In order to do this, a joint European crisis map must be drawn up, through which it would be easier to assess the areas afflicted by abject poverty. Two years ago, the European People’s Party were the first in this Parliament to adopt a Roma strategy. I would like the other parties to join this. I feel it would be very important for us to appear together, side by side, at the Roma hearing on 14 February and to act for this minority. It is very important that something should happen. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, eyewitnesses are reporting a speeding incident which almost defies belief, involving Harald Rømer, the Secretary-General of the European Parliament, at around 3 p.m. on 14 November this year, apparently in a Luxembourg-registered CD vehicle which was travelling from the European Parliament into the centre of Strasbourg. Sparrows were crushed beneath his wheels as he roared along the Allée de la Robertsau, blasting past slow-moving vehicles in traffic queues at speeds of more than 100 km/hour and forcing startled pedestrians to leap to safety off the zebra crossing.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore have a few questions to ask Mr Rømer: were you indeed travelling in this vehicle at the time? Who was at the wheel? What instructions had you – or had you not – given to the driver? Why was the vehicle in question being driven in such a reckless manner, and why was the speed limit exceeded so dramatically? Do you think that traffic regulations do not apply to you? Would you not say that as the European Parliament’s most senior official, you should be showing special consideration to others and keeping within the limits of traffic law? Is this how you intend to behave in future, and should all road-users run in fear from you?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sand in the Kosovo hourglass is trickling down relentlessly, and 10 December is almost upon us. Unfortunately the dialogue of the deaf continues between an extremely autonomous Kosovo inside Serbia’s borders and supervised independence. The legislative elections of 18 November only increased political aspirations, with the victory of the independence supporters in a ballot marked by a record abstention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU must therefore come up with a strategy other than independence, thereby affirming a European foreign policy.

The fact that extremist parties did not obtain the required number of votes to enter the European Parliament shows that Romanian citizens have already proved European maturity and responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Polish fishermen demonstrated in front of the European Commission’s headquarters in Brussels yesterday. They were protesting against the unfair and discriminatory action taken by the Commission against the Polish fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The problem relates to the ban on fishing for cod in the Baltic Sea. Cod is the main source of income for Polish fishermen. The fishing ban was imposed by the Commission as a punishment for exceeding the annual quota for cod catches. In addition, the Commission has threatened that Poland may not be allocated a fishing quota at all for 2008, or that its quota will be reduced. That would certainly bankrupt the Polish fishing industry. The quotas allocated are very restrictive and are based on incomplete and distorted data concerning stocks of cod in the Baltic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Against this background, the question arises as to why Poland was the only country subjected to control, when my country called for detailed control of fishing in all countries. German, Swedish and Danish fishermen are also exceeding the quotas. Are Polish fishermen to become Commissioner Borg’s sacrificial lamb? Alternatively, is this perhaps an effort to eliminate competition by recourse to the European Commission? The Union has evidently failed to take the notion of equality on board, and I therefore support the protest.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0276/2007) by Mrs Kallenbach, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons [COM(2006)0093 – C6-0081/2006 – 2006/0031(COD) ].</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firearms are not an ordinary type of product like any other. A series of tragic events – in Erfurt, Antwerp, Helsinki and elsewhere – have vividly demonstrated the potential danger that firearms pose to the safety of our citizens, especially children. We therefore need very strict rules governing the manufacture, sale and possession of firearms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although our European legislation expressly permits Member States to go beyond the common level of protection afforded by EU law, I am most grateful that Parliament has sought to substantially improve the levels of safety applicable in Europe in respect of firearms. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs Kallenbach, and the Chairman of that Committee, Mrs McCarthy. My express thanks are due to both of them for their excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I remind you of the background to today’s decision. The starting point was the need to make various amendments to our legislation to enable us to ratify the UN Firearms Protocol. A comprehensive revision of Europe’s firearms legislation was not planned until after that. Thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, we have done all of this in one major step, at the first attempt, in fact, as the Council has also given its blessing to the unified proposal before us today.</p>
      <p sl="de">Solutions had to be found to a number of difficult issues and today’s outcome stands up to scrutiny. We are not encroaching on the different traditions and cultural specificities in our Member States, where there are long and highly disparate traditions relating to hunting, sports marksmanship and weapons collecting. These have been respected. A European Firearms Pass will make cross-border travel easier and provide a sound basis for transnational meetings of hunters and sports marksmen in future. We have also opted for appropriate marking and registration of firearms to allow cross-border transfer and transport of firearms in the internal market, but making this more transparent and therefore safer.</p>
      <p sl="de">An important innovation is the registration of all weapons in personal ownership. We need to know who has what. Registration will enable us to curb the illegal ownership or transfer of firearms to an even greater extent. Data will be kept for 20 years, so that traceability is guaranteed for a long enough period. That is certainly to be welcomed. In this context, however, the Commission is considering clarifying, in a declaration, our understanding of the new Recital 9e of the Data Protection Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have also decided to ban the acquisition of firearms by minors under the age of 18 in future. Europe is thus sending out a clear message that firearms are not something that young people should have access to. Of course, we will still allow junior sports marksmen and hunters under the age of 18 to pursue their hobby but only under adult supervision; that means parents or coaches, for example. There have been far too many tragedies involving firearms that have fallen into the hands of young people. I hope that the new rules will help to avoid further tragedies of this kind and raise awareness, especially among junior sports marksmen and hunters, of the need for particular care when handling weapons.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have been confronted with one new problem arising as a result of technological developments and criminal activities in Europe: I am referring to the conversion of copy weapons, which in themselves are not dangerous, into fully operational guns. This is a problem which was first drawn to our attention by Mrs McCarthy. This has allowed de facto circumvention of the law. That will now be stopped. Let me say in passing that we will have to look more closely at the problem of conversion of copy weapons over the next two years in order to close any safety loopholes. The same applies to the question of how we ensure that firearms are deactivated effectively.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you know, the Commission was in favour of building sanctions into European legislation, as the European Court of Justice’s rulings are clear on this point. The Commission recognises, however, that Recital 8 includes a reference to these sanctions under criminal law and the UN Protocol. That is important, as compliance with Article 5 of the UN Protocol requires sanctions to be applied by Member States. I am confident that this is something that the Member States are envisaging in their national law. A Commission declaration on this issue will also be submitted to the European Parliament’s Secretariat . I would particularly like to thank Mr Alvaro for his support here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe will thus have modern firearms legislation that prioritises the safety of citizens and takes account of the need to protect our children and young people. We are thus increasing the level of protection afforded by Community law.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is now up to the Member States to recognise the sign of the times and, taking account of national conditions, to develop these provisions further on an individual basis. This means that any Member State which considers that more stringent provisions are necessary and appropriate will have my personal support, and I can only encourage these Member States to take such action.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am relying on your colleagues in the national parliaments to make a clear decision when it comes to the issue of firearms. The watchword must always be ‘safety first’. Today’s decision will clear the way for that, and I would like to thank you for your support in this endeavour.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commission declarations appended to debate</p>
      <p sl="de">1) Declaration on Sanctions</p>
      <p sl="de">'The Commission welcomes the rapid adoption of the Council Directive amending Directive 91/477 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons, but regrets that the Council opposed its initial proposal regarding Article 16 on criminal sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission notes that the Community has competence to establish criminal sanctions in conformity with Article 5 of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.</p>
      <p sl="de">Accordingly, the Commission considers that any decision to ratify the Protocol would have to be accompanied by a declaration of competence that correctly reflects the scope of the Community competence.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission reserves its institutional rights in this regard.'</p>
      <p sl="de">2) Draft declaration on data protection</p>
      <p sl="de">'The Commission notes that the processing of personal data under this Directive is subject to compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and cannot prejudice the level of protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data under the provisions of Community and national law, and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set forth in Directive 95/46/EC.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this respect, the necessity to prolong the minimum period during which the registers containing information on the owners of weapons are kept from ten to twenty years should be justified. The Commission is convinced that such processing of personal data is justified in view both of the dangerous nature and longevity of such weapons and of their possible misuse for criminal purposes, which therefore requires the proper tracing of both firearms and their owners.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission further notes that, in view of the purposes of this Directive, and in accordance with the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC, access to the centralised data filing system, or the system guaranteeing access to non-centralised filing systems, should only be available to police and judicial authorities for the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences.'</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a very protracted process is nearing what I hope will be a successful conclusion. Let me start, then, by expressing my warm thanks to everyone who has made a valuable contribution to this process: the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Podestà, Mr Lehtinen and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, the Committee Chairman Arlene McCarthy, and the secretariat responsible, the staff of the rapporteurs for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Alvaro, and others who supported the process, the Council Presidency, represented by António Delicado and his colleagues and last but not least, the Commission, represented by Mr Michel Ayral and his colleagues, who were motivated by their Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, to find a common solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have learned a great deal throughout this process. I have learned about the true role that lobbyists can play: some of them contributed constructively to achieving common solutions, whereas others deliberately set out to obstruct the process with half-truths and misinformation. From the outset, it was obvious to me that it is no simple matter to strike the right balance between the requirements of a well-functioning internal market, the justified safety concerns of citizens about the illegal use of firearms and the understandable desire of hunters and sports marksmen to pursue their hobbies largely unhindered. As Mr Verheugen has said, we wanted to utilise the experience gained with the application of Directive 91/477/EEC, remove some of the shortcomings identified, and transpose the UN Firearms Protocol, which was signed by the Commission back in 2002, into Community law. We were therefore obliged to include specific articles to cover the illegal use, trade and acquisition of firearms. This compromise takes account of these requirements. I admit that I would have preferred even more clear-cut provisions here and there, for example in order to achieve better legislation or to simplify matters, and indeed to reduce the number of firearms categories to two on a Europe-wide basis, as is already the case in two-thirds of the Member States. However, I was unable to secure majorities here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, however, I am very satisfied with the compromise achieved. Let us consider for a moment: we will thus be implementing a partially harmonised firearms law in 27 Member States. We still have very disparate firearms laws in place at national level, and this partial harmonisation will facilitate legal trade and make a contribution to greater safety. A 100% guarantee that there will be no abuse is impossible, but as we have already heard, we should recognise that we have an obligation to try, as far as possible, to prevent tragedies such as those which occurred in Germany, Finland or Belgium.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not intend to focus on the details of the new legislation now; you are familiar with them already and Mr Verheugen has already mentioned a number of them. I welcome the fact that, by 2014, we will have a computer-based firearms register in the Member States; this will improve information exchange and do much to facilitate traceability in the event of abuse, and may even make traceability possible in the first place. We take the Internet age into account as well, as the provisions will apply to online purchases just as they do to face-to-face trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I conclude by making a number of points which should make your decision easier and counter the arguments of those who oppose better European firearms legislation. The directive will not apply to weapons and ammunition collectors, to public services or to cultural and historical institutions. The provisions will not apply retroactively. We are proposing national firearms registers, not a European register. Although we do have a register of that kind for cows, it seems to be more difficult to achieve in relation to firearms. Nor are we opposed on principle to manufacturers, dealers, sports marksmen or hunters who deal responsibly with firearms with full awareness of their special nature.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have been told that, when the original Directive was debated in the 1990s, very serious concerns were expressed, and the discussions became very emotional. Later, though, this Directive came to be regarded as very helpful, practical and effective. In that sense, I am confident that the compromise before you will also be a success, and I count on your support.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I do not think there is much to be added to what Mrs Kallenbach has just said, other than that it has been a pleasure for me to work alongside the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Arlene McCarthy, and my colleague on that Committee, Gisela Kallenbach, with whom I worked very closely with great confidence during this phase of the process. Not least, I would also like to thank the Commission, represented in this case by Commissioner Verheugen. Such close cooperation is a rare commodity.</p>
      <p sl="de">What can you say in a minute when you have taken 30 seconds to thank people?</p>
      <p sl="de">In essence, what we have achieved is this: the European Union has sent out a clear message that, when it regulates the legal firearms trade, it is equally concerned about tackling the illegal transfer and abuse of firearms. We have made it clear that the European Union will not tolerate any form of crime involving firearms on its territory, that we will not tolerate people using weapons which they have not acquired through a legal process, and we will not tolerate a situation in which people abuse the rights they have acquired through the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">I say this to everyone who has today received countless e-mails, as I have, from hunters and sports marksmen accusing us in the European Union of restricting their freedoms: read the directive, contact the Commission and you will see that the European Union has taken action to protect its citizens, not the reverse!</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Kallenbach, and to the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for having made themselves constantly available for consultations, enabling us to achieve an innovative but, I must say, well-balanced compromise.</p>
      <p sl="it">The purpose of the proposed amendment to the Directive is to adapt it to the UN Protocol on combating organised crime, as concerns the legal purchase and trade in firearms intended purely for civilian use. The Directive covers issues to which everyone is sensitive, such as the safety of our citizens, but also sporting traditions and the customary lifestyles of millions of Europeans who go hunting.</p>
      <p sl="it">Close consultations with the Council have enabled us to produce a text that strikes a fair balance between the desire to draw up harmonised rules and respect for individual countries’ specific cultural practices, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the first point, I would emphasise the marking system for firearms and their essential parts, not least for purposes of ensuring their traceability, the obligation to retain data for no less than 20 years, more rigorous monitoring of online selling, given the risks this is known to entail, restrictions on the use of firearms by minors and by people thought likely to endanger public safety, and the introduction of general principles on the deactivation of firearms.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the second point, I would recall that the present four-category classification has been preserved, out of respect for the already-mentioned cultural and traditional practices, with a reassessment of the advantages and drawbacks of perhaps cutting back to just two categories to be carried out by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the Council’s lack of availability has meant that the European Firearms Pass will not be the only document required for the carriage of firearms, and in my opinion this is a missed opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur Mrs Kallenbach, to the other shadow rapporteurs, and to Mrs McCarthy, Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for seeing through this complicated legal package. When almost two years ago we started this work, we were assured that this would above all be a technical measure, the sole purpose of which was to use the UN Firearms Protocol to enable it to become EU legislation. The process, however, was anything but a technical one. Some wanted to ban weapons completely and restrict people’s legal enjoyment of them, whilst certain people did not want to see any kinds of controls on the purchase and use of weapons.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Under the leadership of our rapporteur, Mrs Kallenbach, however, we found a balanced compromise among the main groups, one which takes account of the safety of individuals and society as well as the needs of those who enjoy using weapons as a pastime and hunters too, for example. It is a good thing that all weapons in the EU should be registered in order to make it easier to trace them and that Member States in future will have to keep the details of a weapon and its owner for a period of 20 years. It is also important that imitation and converted weapons should be covered under the directive. The lives of hunters and marksmen will be made a lot easier when the European Firearms Pass is the only document they need when travelling from one country to another, and there should be no fee charged for one.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The age limit of 18 years old which is stipulated in the directive and its exceptions is sensible, in my view. It means, for example, that in my country, Finland, the thousands of registered underage hunters may continue to pursue their hobby with the permission of their parents, just as they have up until now. It is directives such as these which prove their worth in the eyes of the public. The EU’s Four Freedoms will likewise gain strength when the EU is developed as a safe area of internal rights.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I too first of all would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kallenbach, for a very well drafted report. It is important for everyone’s future to prevent the illegal manufacture of, and the trade in, firearms. The report will help achieve this objective.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We Finns have been concerned about whether or not young people should be allowed to continue to hunt for pleasure. The sport is subject to licence in Finland and closely supervised, and there is guidance available from experienced hunters in the safe and responsible use of weapons. I think it is important that this best practice and long tradition in Finland will also be able to continue after the new directive has been adopted. It is important that tomorrow we agree a carefully prepared compromise, in which the different practices in the Member States are made compatible and the Member States can allow, subject to certain conditions, the purchase and possession of firearms for the purposes of hunting for under 18-year-olds too.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is very important to control possession of firearms if we wish to ensure the safety of people living in Europe. Clearly, any relevant provisions must not unduly restrict the right of citizens to ensure their own security on their own property, nor must they restrict their right to ensure their personal safety when undertaking important public duties or after having done so.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, citizens are entitled to possess weapons that are family heirlooms or are used in hunting or for sporting purposes. This is all part of Europe’s tradition. All restrictions should relate to the psychological state of the individual and should also apply to people suspected of offences classed as crimes. Furthermore, I believe such restrictions should apply to people who publicly advocate Fascism and radical Communism and to extremist Islamic activists.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Technology is currently available in Europe allowing anyone good with their hands to create an amateur firearm relatively quickly. The implementation of undue restrictions will not therefore prevent the criminal fraternity from possessing firearms and will unduly restrict the rights of citizens, including their right to self-defence. Our border controls must be strengthened still further, because illegal immigrants are still managing to enter Europe and weapons can be smuggled in even more easily.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the proposed changes to the EU’s weapons directive are aimed at improving the control of weapons. There will be better labelling and more stringent requirements on trade in and the manufacture of weapons. That is good, and it is especially good that the committee wants to tighten up these requirements even further. This issue takes on particular importance, seen in the context of the tragic fatal shootings at Jokela School in Finland a few weeks ago. The combination of drifting youngsters, the spread of a culture of violence on the Internet and access to weapons is unfortunately a lethal one. That is why the tighter measures we now have to adopt are immensely important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also good that this is a minimum requirements directive. In other words Member States can go further and have more progressive legislation. I would like all EU legislation to be on this basis. That would solve many problems. It looks as though we can reach agreement on first reading. That is good because it enables us to save time and resources which can be devoted to something else, for example work to bring about a more peaceful and more child-friendly society.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, hunting is an old-established custom. Every Member State has its unique hunting tradition to protect. Today’s debate therefore represents the conclusion to a long process. Strong wills have opposed one another, many discussions have taken place and the shadow rapporteur has been barred from taking part in the tripartite meetings.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many of the original proposals could have threatened the hunting cultures of Member States. Regrettably, the European Firearms Pass did not suffice as the only document needed for the occasional use of hunting and marksmen’s weapons in another Member State. Freedom of movement is prevented by the fact that certain Member States are permitted to require additional documents. Huntsmen and marksmen from the Community will be subject to greater bureaucracy than persons from third countries. Fortunately fees for such permits have been prohibited.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the course of the process, as shadow rapporteur, I tried to influence the final report on those occasions when I was permitted to participate in the meetings. My work focused mainly on two questions. I was concerned to prevent a ban on ordering weapons on the Internet and to forestall changes in the availability of exemptions for schools offering training in nature management and marksmanship. In remote regions a ban on the purchase of weapons on the internet would prevent access to weapons for hunting purposes. In Sweden today we have good regulations on internet purchases, which are accepted by both the hunting community and the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The second question was about the minimum age criteria, which would affect various types of upper secondary school programme. In Sweden training in hunting performs an important function in teaching future generations about hunting and game conservation. Now our hunting traditions can live on. What had been an unwieldy bureaucratic proposal has now become an acceptable, though not ideal, compromise.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Schengen and ever more brutal criminal gangs undoubtedly make it essential to adopt a tougher approach to the illegal possession of firearms and to organised crime. However, the whole thing becomes a farce when innocent citizens, hunters and sports marksmen are, in effect, treated the same as criminals. Instead, the overriding priority must be to increase numbers in our police forces, which have been cut back in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the United Kingdom, crime statistics have soared since the total ban on handguns was introduced, and in my view, this should make us pause for thought. In our increasingly unruly times, when the state is making savings in the security sphere, it must be permissible for innocent citizens who have all their mental faculties to ward off a threatened attack on life and limb if necessary. The fact is that most crimes are not committed using legally acquired weapons.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU should perhaps focus to a greater extent on better protection of its borders, for example by increasing the resources available to FRONTEX, and on improving cooperation in the security sphere.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU countries have perfectly serviceable firearms legislation and if more stringent provisions are required or necessary, the relevant decisions should be taken in the countries concerned.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the starting point of this dossier and look at how far we have come, I think it is fair to say that we have managed to put this very controversial issue back on an objective footing. In cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we have found a solution which allows better controls on firearms throughout the European Union, without neglecting the justified interests of sports marksmen and hunters who are concerned about excessive bureaucracy and excessive registration requirements. I am most grateful to Commissioner Verheugen but also to the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Arlene McCarthy, and of course our shadow rapporteur, who worked very hard on this dossier for many months with the rapporteur and the other colleagues concerned. This was not a simple matter for the various groups involved, but I think we have achieved a compromise solution which – given the background in the Council – was the only possible route.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the trade-related part is concerned, which is covered by the UN Protocol and which still lies ahead, the question is to what extent the Commission is capable of presenting a proposal which will meet with the general approval of Council and make Parliament’s work rather more straightforward. I am not being ironical, Commissioner: in all seriousness, I wish you every success in skilfully convincing your colleagues in the Council that the obligations they have undertaken under the UN Protocol must naturally apply in the EU as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to thank everyone who played a part in keeping the ball in play on this very controversial issue. I think that a sound solution has been reached for all concerned on the basis of a compromise, and I hope that tomorrow we will be able to endorse this compromise with a broad majority.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am speaking as a concerned MEP, and not as committee chairwoman. I believe that, with this new law on weapons, we can demonstrate to our citizens that Europe can act to tackle the problem of illegal guns. We have tough laws in Britain, but without this EU law guns will continue to find their way onto the streets of cities like Manchester and Liverpool.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, this is a 9 mm Smith &amp; Wesson copy – a convertible weapon designed to fire blanks or CS gas pellets – which, when converted, fires live ammunition. Do not panic – it is not loaded, it is convertible, not converted. A gun like this tragically killed a 12-year-old Manchester girl, Kamilah Peniston. Mothers Against Violence, mothers who have lost children to gun crime, ask me where these guns are coming from and what we are doing here to stop the illegal smuggling of these deadly weapons.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greater Manchester Police tell me that 46% of all guns seized last year were converted weapons. Converted weapons are now a cheap, popular choice for criminals, and they are a growing problem in Europe – not just in the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I thank Commissioner Verheugen, Ms Kallenbach our rapporteur, Mr Alvaro and 25 of the Member States for supporting my amendments to crack down and tighten controls on these convertible weapons. Putting them under the same control system as real hand guns will make it much more difficult for criminal gangs to get their hands on them, and it will cut the smuggling of these weapons, which are banned in Britain.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Association of Chief Police Officers in the UK fully supports this law and its requirements for convertible and deactivated weapons, for marking, for traceability and for controls on weapons’ sales by distance communication, including the internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the recent tragic shooting in Finland and the attempted shooting at a school in Germany, it is clear that we need stricter EU-wide standards of gun control. This is Europe being pragmatic and taking practical action to protect our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The tragic and senseless gun deaths of young people in my region – 15-year-old Jessie James, 11-year-old Rhys Jones and 12-year-old Kamilah Peniston – are a deeply sensitive issue. Their lives were taken from them. We, here in Europe, owe it to them and their families to ensure that we take these guns off the streets.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
      <p sl="et">In today’s society with all its dangers, all attempts to increase people’s security are whole-heartedly welcomed. Security is a prerequisite for all freedoms. Security is a basic quality of a democratic society.</p>
      <p sl="et">Fresh in all our minds is the Jokela School massacre, which was not the first example of such an occurrence. We must, however, ensure that it is the last.</p>
      <p sl="et">According to World Health Organisation data, interpersonal violence and suicide rank respectively third and fourth worldwide among people aged 15–44 years as the leading causes of ill-health and premature mortality.</p>
      <p sl="et">A large proportion of these occur through the use of firearms. The easy availability of firearms has been associated with higher firearm mortality rates.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is most welcome that the European Union understands the need to shift the focus to the specific threat.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to go into one more aspect. Specifically, since the transposition of the Directive in 1993, the internet has developed considerably and become an electronic market place.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Directive's aim of stopping trade in firearms can only be achieved, therefore, if internet trading is included in its scope.</p>
      <p sl="et">I am therefore of the view that the Member States of the European Union must react in an appropriate and consistent manner to the situation regarding the firearms in question. To do so we need harmonised preventive and punitive measures and we need to integrate them into a single policy.</p>
      <p sl="et">Finally, my thanks to the rapporteur and the people who worked with her.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with time to make only one point, I want to draw attention to the unequal way in which the European firearms pass operates in practice, particularly as it affects the hunting fraternity. If the owner of a registered weapon wishes to go hunting in most other EU countries, he simply produces his Europass at his point of entry, but if he wants to enter the United Kingdom he must supply his original Europass in advance, and then wait six to eight weeks for it to be processed by the local police. Thus he is without the pass for that time and cannot hunt in other third countries in the mean time.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no need for such bureaucracy, which is severely damaging the promotion of hunting holidays in the United Kingdom, including in my constituency of Northern Ireland. Surely, even an advance photocopy of the Europass would serve the same purpose. I trust, therefore, that, in due course, that anomaly will be addressed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basis for the amendment of this Directive was the UN Protocol and the question of how we can tackle terrorism effectively. That was also the basis for the Commission’s proposal. The rapporteur’s proposal adopted a fairly revolutionary approach to the existing Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at what we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow, we see that it is a compromise which, as so often, does not completely satisfy all sides. The compromise is this: on the one hand, we are trying to tackle everything that is illegal – and here, we are never rigorous enough – and on the other hand, we do not wish to overly complicate the use of legal firearms. There are certainly some aspects, such as categories or registration, where tougher rules on the basis of subsidiarity would have been appropriate, but this was not a 100% success. However, a start has been made and we will see how the exercise works out in practice, and how Member States tackle this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that this is a viable compromise, and I know that everyone involved has worked very hard to achieve it, so I too would like to express my thanks.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, however, I think we must constantly be mindful of the difference between legal and illegal firearms. We have to tackle the issue of illegality in a rigorous and consistent manner, but we must apply a judicious approach and a lack of bureaucratic complexity as the appropriate benchmarks in the legal sphere.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the text we will be voting on tomorrow is a compromise which finally satisfies almost all legal gun users. The Commission’s original text was perfectly acceptable to us, as were the positions of the Council. The rapporteur, unfortunately, adopted rather weird positions, and we had to put up quite a fight against her initial ideas. I also wish to thank Mr Podesta for his truly carthorse work, his patience and his diplomacy within the PPE Group and at many working meetings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The compromises we have produced satisfy all legal gun users. I should say that French hunters are quite satisfied that the four categories have been maintained: this is an important issue in France, and I am very pleased this evening that we managed to retain them. I am also pleased to say that I am satisfied with the central registration system, for it is also logical that we should be able to trace guns. I feel this is a most important point for the safety of citizens. Arms dealers are also satisfied with the CIP marking. We are also satisfied with remote sales. We are relatively satisfied with the text as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I feel that the past year’s work ought to make us reflect on the matter of the initial positions of the rapporteurs, and I must say we should be wary of adopting excessively inflexible positions on certain initial aspects. In fact, if the Commission, the Council and the PPE Group had not firmly defended their positions, I believe we would have been steered towards a text that would have been impossible to apply, and towards green positions and an ideology to the great detriment of hunters and legal gun users.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have to answer that question because it just shows that Mr Rübig does not understand the legislation in front of him.

The IND/DEM Group was invited, it appointed a rapporteur 18 months ago, it did not turn up to any meetings in committee or to any hearings, and it did not turn up to any trialogues. Ms Goudin knows very well that she was only appointed two weeks ago to take over from the shadow rapporteur, who did not turn up.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0399/2007) by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on a renewed EU tourism policy: towards a stronger partnership for European tourism [2006/2129(INI) ].</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-221" speaker_id="4747" name="Paolo COSTA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Italy" birth_date="23-07-1943" birth_place="Venezia" p_group="Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe" m_state="IT">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting, and that I had the pleasure of putting together with the cooperation of a number of colleagues, in fact follows on from a report already adopted by this House – the one by Mr Queiró – through which Parliament sought to make a contribution to European tourism policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The inspiration behind this report is the need to devise a different, and I hope more practical, approach to European Union policy on tourism, which is currently restricted by the provisions of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Member States have not conferred much responsibility for tourism on the European institutions under the existing Treaty, and I must say that not even the treaty we are about to approve - and which I hope the Union will adopt next month in Lisbon - will increase the EU’s formal powers over tourism to any great extent.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, however, the existing Treaties do enable the Union to implement a large number of policies which have a considerable impact on tourism and on the possibility of increasing it or maintaining Europe’s competitiveness as a world leader.</p>
      <p sl="it">The purpose of this report, therefore, is to set out various possibilities. The list drawn up by us in this House, with everyone’s assistance, is merely an indicative list, which I hope can be further expanded. It is a list of opportunities for using the EU’s full range of existing powers to benefit tourism.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let me give just two examples: the tourist is a traveller, so by definition many of our transport policies can be seen, or re-read, in terms of and in favour of tourism; the tourist is a consumer, so many of the EU’s consumer protection measures can be re-read in terms of tourist requirements.</p>
      <p sl="it">More broadly, however, tourists – especially those arriving in Europe from third countries – are people who cross borders, just as other people cross borders for various reasons. The European Union’s visa policy, its immigration policy, should be carefully revised in order to be able to attract the maximum possible number of tourists.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many of the contracts signed by tourists nowadays are concluded directly, using web-based technology, and do not afford them full protection. The EU can thus do a lot for tourists by protecting such contracts or introducing types of contracts which do afford protection. I will spare you the details.</p>
      <p sl="it">In sum, we all acknowledge that tourism is one of Europe’s most promising industries, and I think we can say that – above all for reasons of cohesion – it is worth standing by our main aim of developing the tourist economy; this means making the most of resources such as cultural and environmental resources, which can be done by utilising the Union’s formal powers to the full.</p>
      <p sl="it">The intention behind this report is therefore to encourage the Commission and the Council to envisage a set of initiatives belonging formally to other fields of competence – I repeat, consumer protection, transport safety, guarantees for certain tourism-related contracts, immigration policy, coordinated promotion campaigns beyond Europe’s borders, and so on – to put together a set of initiatives, a package of tourism initiatives. I firmly believe that these could constitute a real contribution by the European institutions to preserving and developing a sector that, as we all know, plays a major part and will play an ever greater part in the future of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Committee Chairman, Mr Costa, on his report. The report makes clear the great extent to which tourism is influenced by different Community policies, but above all, it shows how important this sector is for Europe as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tourism is an expression of Europe’s lifestyle and prosperity but it is also a key economic sector with substantial potential for growth and employment. In fact, tourism already accounts directly and indirectly for more than 10% of gross domestic product in the European Union and provides around 12% of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is not just Europe that is seeking to benefit from the extraordinary economic prospects afforded by the development of tourism. We have to equip ourselves with the capacities that will enable us to flourish in competition with other traditional and new tourism markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Here, Europe can build on the competitive advantages which already make it a highly attractive destination. We have an unparalleled heritage, a unique geographical concentration of attractive and culturally diverse sites, and we rightly have a reputation for a high level of service.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are trump cards that we must play as we seek to develop Europe as a tourism product in future. Quite simply, our destinations must be the best and the most attractive, forming an offer that makes Europeans and non-Europeans want to spend their holidays here, again and again.</p>
      <p sl="de">This means that the criteria which have to be met in other sectors of our economy have to be met in tourism as well: we need European tourism to be a product that is innovative and provides an optimum choice for consumers, that meets the highest quality standards and that is as environmentally friendly as possible. In short, it must be a product which is an expression of our European values and strengths.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me give you some examples of how we are promoting cooperation and keeping this competitive edge in the tourism sector. Last month, we had the European Tourism Forum in Portugal, an annual event bringing together all actors in this sector, and it is an excellent opportunity for cooperation and for showcasing Europe. On that occasion, I had the honour of presenting the ‘European Destination of Excellence’ award to 10 European destinations nominated as the Best Emerging European Rural Destinations of Excellence. This pilot project is helping to raise the profile of all Europe’s destinations outside Europe and draw attention to the diversity and quality of tourism in Europe. I would like to remind everyone that this type of project was explicitly called for in Parliament’s previous report initiated by Mr Queiró. I would like to thank the European Parliament and Mr Costa in particular for the generous support given to this successful initiative. I am pleased to say that far more countries are now participating in the second round of the competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can also tell you at this stage that the web portal for ‘destination Europe’ has been a success and provides a sound basis with potential for expansion. We are currently exploring other ways of improving Europe’s image as a tourist destination and are hoping for your support here.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, let me emphasise that increasing sustainability in tourism is a key aspect of our policy. I am convinced that if we integrate sustainability aspects into all areas of our tourism industry, this will enable us to protect those competitive advantages which already make Europe the world’s most attractive tourist destination.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission unveiled its new ‘Agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism’ last month. The components of that ‘Agenda’ constitute a response to the calls set out in this and the previous report from Parliament. I think that here too, we can look forward to continued good cooperation in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is my hope that the ‘Agenda’ will be adopted by all tourism industry stakeholders and, indeed, by tourists themselves, and given that all of us in this Chamber are frequent travellers, that includes us as well.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the tourism sector is particularly significant. Directly and indirectly, it generates more than 10% of the GDP of the European Union and employs roughly 12% of the workforce. Although this does not fall within the competence of the European Union, there are a number of measures and actions which may contribute to an upward trend in the sector and its sustainable development. Many of these are already mentioned in the report, and at this point I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="el">The challenges facing tourism call for a coherent policy response at EU level: a comprehensive and competitive framework for action, with specific quantitative and qualitative targets. In the new planning period, and given the targets which have been set under the revised Lisbon strategy, cooperation and synergy are necessary at all levels – European, national, regional and local – to enable the tourism sector to contribute to achieving these targets. It is also necessary to coordinate the policies and actions which have direct or indirect impact on the tourism sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that on the question of what kind of tourism sector we want in the European Union, we have already given our answer. We want a viable sector which will develop according to the principles of sustainability, will offer high-quality tourist products and services, and will not exclude anyone. If we all act together, at all levels, we can now achieve this aim.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tourism is extremely important to the EU. It certainly has major effects on economic growth and job creation in Europe. Beyond these aspects, it also encourages integration, dialogue between different peoples and knowledge of each other’s cultures, and thus helps in the development of a sense of European citizenship. Consequently, in the absence of a common tourism policy, issues in this industry, which covers several areas and involves a wide range of services and professions, must be taken into account at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report submitted to us today brings this need to light. I must therefore congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, and more specifically for supporting some of the priorities stated by the Committee on Culture and Education. Europe’s diversity and richness mean that it is still the world’s most popular tourist destination. We must rethink our policies and update them to take more account of culture in order to retain this position. Likewise, we must highlight the need to preserve Europe’s natural and cultural heritage and promote traditional culture, in particular popular and artistic crafts, trades and skills which are in the process of disappearing, and encourage initiatives to enhance and promote this heritage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, among other measures we must support the creation of a European Cultural Heritage label, which I feel sure will increase our fellow citizens’ sense of belonging to a common cultural space and identity. It is also essential to encourage development of new technology which plays such a major role in selling tourist products, promoting cultural commodities and events, and managing and conserving sites, and will continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in association with all tourism players at all levels, we must promote sustainable and high-quality tourism which is competitive, environmentally-friendly, responsible, and above all accessible to everyone.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, it is rightly stated in the report under discussion – and I must here congratulate the rapporteur – that the tourism sector is at the crosswords of numerous European Union policies and has a substantial impact on growth and employment and also on social and territorial cohesion. It is therefore essential to realise certain aspects of tourism policy, following the definition of the guiding principles in Parliament’s resolution of 8 September 2005 for which I was the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first aspect concerns simplifying and harmonising the tourist visa application procedures for entry into the Member States, with a view to reducing their costs and facilitating access to the European Union for tourists from third countries. However, we feel it is right, if not essential, to maintain the security rules required in order to combat terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration. We also see a need to modernise the system for collecting statistical information, including the Satellite Accounts, as it is only with up-to-date and trustworthy data that the public authorities and industry can take the key strategic decisions which will allow Europe to maintain its current leading position.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also have a point to make on the rather more contentious issue of a possible harmonisation of quality standards for tourist accommodation in Europe. The multiplicity of classification schemes for hotels must be combined with the issue of protecting the rights and expectations of tourists when making their choices. Will it be possible to establish, in the European Union, minimum standards for safety and quality which guarantee the reliability and transparency of information provided to these consumers? This is certainly desirable but we feel that it will only be possible on a voluntary basis and by inviting all the stakeholders to take part in this work. The Commission may, if it so wishes, assume a fundamental driving role in this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is not enough time to mention other equally important aspects of this report, including accessible tourism for tourists with reduced mobility, passenger rights or the external promotion of European destinations and the development of sustainable policies. However, it has been adequately demonstrated, and I will end on this point, that the European Parliament has done its work and we hope that the other public bodies, in partnership with the private sector, will reinforce their spirit of cooperation and respond effectively to the challenges of developing a renewed and sustainable EU tourism policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the new EU tourism policy proposed by the European Commission and discussed in the Costa report deserves my full support. This is due both to the main objectives set out following the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy – improvement of competitiveness, creation of more and better jobs, sustainable development – and also due to the instruments through which the Commission proposes to achieve these objectives: coordination within the Commission and within national authorities, cooperation between the different stakeholders and establishment of specific supporting actions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur, Paolo Costa, who I congratulate on the quality of his report and also on his readiness to accept the proposed amendments, has drawn attention to certain aspects and concerns omitted from the Commission communication. He has put forward possible opportunities and solutions for a future renewed EU tourism policy, particularly on the visa granting policy, harmonisation of quality standards, improvement of visibility and understanding of labels by tourists, consumer protection, accessibility of tourism for tourists with reduced mobility, guarantee of passenger rights, and promotion of destinations within the European Union. We feel it is absolutely right that account should be taken of these aspects and the solutions proposed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr Costa’s draft report has in turn been enriched and improved by a number of amendments, many tabled by colleagues from my Group. I myself, in order to reinforce the terms of the Commission’s proposals and take account of the rapporteur’s proposals, tabled various amendments further to the positions that I defended in the Queiró report. These included: the need to duly consider the accessibility handicap affecting regions with specific natural or geographical characteristics, such as the outermost regions; the need for the renewed EU tourism policy to make European tourism sustainable in economic, social, territorial, environmental and cultural terms; the promotion of Europe as a tourist destination or a collection of attractive tourist destinations; the need to coordinate the policies with a direct or indirect impact on tourism; closer cooperation among the stakeholders in the sector – the European Commission and the Member States, the regions, local authorities and tourism services – and better use of existing European financial instruments. I therefore particularly call on my Group to support this report and I urge the Commission and the Council to take due account of the suggestions and recommendations of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tourism certainly accounts for a very large slice of our economies but, to a certain extent, it also represents the continued construction of the European identity and our cohesion policy. It often contributes, of course, to maintaining activity in the most isolated areas, and is often the main resource in our outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This comprehensive report sets out the main points on which the EU can now provide genuine added value in order to optimise this resource intelligently so that it is beneficial to all, to those working in the tourist industry, to the tourists themselves, and in short to Europeans, with long-term conservation of our landscapes and ecosystems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Personally, since I come from a region lucky enough to have three European neighbours, I am particularly sensitive to border tourism and I hope that, through the partnerships, this type of tourism will help build a genuine living space both for European citizens and beyond the EU’s internal borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, to open up to a larger extent to non-EU tourism, we must implement a coordinated policy to grant tourist visas. I would also like the EU to adopt statistical tools and a cross-sector approach in terms of Community financing in order to bring about the well-known leverage effects on innovation, jobs, an improved offer and quality of service. I hope we can create European quality labels in accordance with ecological and social criteria, and quite simply enhance information and protection for European consumers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, when Thomas Cook opened his first travel agency in 1841, I am sure he did not anticipate that 166 years later, tourism would account directly for approximately 5% of the income of European countries. I should add that, if the links with other sectors are taken into account, tourism currently generates over 11% of GDP and approximately 25 million jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should therefore like to thank Mr Costa for his report on such a dynamic sector of the economy. We are all aware that tourism is not directly covered by Union regulations. Nonetheless, the Union’s role as a coordinator and promoter makes a significant contribution to presenting Europe as a very attractive and diverse tourist destination. It has a bearing on tourism within the Union, on incoming tourism from countries outside the Union and on outward journeys to the latter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These issues are of great importance to the new Member States, including Poland. Only now are many people starting to discover how attractive places that were previously behind the Iron Curtain can be as tourist destinations. In this context, national, regional and local authorities have an important role to play in encouraging tourism. Tourism also encompasses so-called Green Tourism, tourism in search of Europe’s cultural heritage, health tourism, pilgrimages, and eco-tourism seeking natural beauty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am glad the problems for disabled and older tourists have been taken into account, though perhaps more attention could have been devoted to them. The Cohesion Fund should be used wisely to support the development of infrastructure, in particular transport infrastructure. The European Regional Development Fund may also be used to support the development of ICT, including the Internet, and to promote cross-border cooperation to benefit tourism in its broadest sense. In addition, the European Social Fund should be used to finance training programmes in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, I should like to say that standards are the key to success in this sector. Nobody is satisfied with mediocre quality. A tourist who is disappointed with the standard of transport or of a hotel or a tourist who has a poor experience in a restaurant will never return to the destination concerned again.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to Paolo Costa. I especially welcome those aspects of the report which underline the importance of social and ecological sustainability. A carefully preserved natural and cultural landscape is the best magnet to attract tourists to a destination country.</p>
      <p sl="de">The acceptance of tourism by the citizens of the host country – in other words, the people who live and work there – is a key prerequisite in ensuring that tourists feel that they are genuinely welcome guests. A high level of training and overall satisfaction among employees in the tourism industry is what is needed to guarantee satisfied guests. Mobility is a prerequisite for tourism, and ‘soft’ forms – public transport, cycling or walking – will promote growth without destroying the essential bases of a healthy and, of course, sustainable tourism industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">This comprehensive report contains a number of ideas which should be more than pious wishes. I trust that these ecological and social principles will be embedded in the ‘European Agenda 21 for Tourism’ that has been announced.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the tourism industry, especially in countries such as Cyprus, Spain, Greece and others, is a sector of major economic importance, and yet the European Commission does not have a word to say about those who work in it.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is an industry which is perhaps the first to apply flexible hours for employees, and where seasonal layoffs are the order of the day. It is also a sector where the employment of foreign nationals raises two key issues: firstly, their exploitation, and secondly, their use as blackmail by large hotel chains to drive down the wages or benefits paid to local workers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Apart from this, the European Commission simply confirms the fact, without making any substantial comment, that the cause of job creation in this sector is the high level of part-time employment and the flexible employment terms. The concept of long-term employment seems, then, to be nothing but pie in the sky.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the opportunities implied by healthcare tourism. It is important that we make use of all the available programmes to support such healthcare tourism, including the second Community healthcare action programme. I would like to stress that we must involve the insurance sector more in supporting healthcare tourism, and together we must find a way for cross-border cooperation with this funding.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The question is whether we will be able to make such services part of the common market. We are talking about services that not only account for a proportion of economic growth but also help European citizens so that everyone can benefit from the opportunities offered by healthcare tourism and, within this, the opportunities offered by the common market. Indeed, it is true that, to do this, we will need, or would need, a slightly better-defined quality system, so I very much support Mr Costa’s initiative, which has undeniably formulated a way to make progress in this direction. It would be good for our European tourism if those arriving from outside, from third countries, knew what they were getting from the services and what they were paying for. Briefly, in summary, I therefore think that when we talk about this sector, we need to look at tourism in a much more multi-faceted way, and we must also investigate what these services can bring us from the perspective of the common market. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, who is chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and who began by pointing out that the Treaties allow policies that impact on tourism. It is therefore very appropriate that we are considering this issue. Equally, as Mr Arnaoutakis reminded us a few moments ago, at least 12% of jobs in the EU depend on tourism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is much more, nowadays, than just a common market for goods and capital. It is a common market for people. EU citizens, as we know, are travelling more than ever, not least as tourists. Many, perhaps most, have very good experiences, but it is the minority – the few who have less happy experiences – that give some aspects of the tourism industry a poor name.</p>
      <p sl="en">I draw colleagues’ attention in particular to paragraphs 24 and 25, which call for a set of comprehensive guidelines for hotels that are sensitive to the needs of consumers. Those guidelines should take into account the demands of families with children. Not all hotels may be able to respond to these, but the industry really needs to make itself as family-friendly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, a system of classification must take into account the needs of the elderly and the disabled. The Transport Committee has argued for this in the case of airlines, and it is right to require that hotels, too, should not discriminate against this social group. Nor should they be able to make moral judgments on who qualifies as a couple, and who does not.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is also right to point out, as it does in paragraph 48, which suggests a charter of rights and obligations for tourists, that tourists should themselves behave properly and respect hotels and the tourism business.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a good report, it is a ‘good news’ story and it sends a message that Parliament is acting sensibly in the interests of the consumers. I hope that message reaches the people of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some extremely interesting ideas emerge from Paolo Costa’s truly excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should just like to make a few brief remarks, based on the profound changes in demand caused mainly by globalisation, by the increasingly large presence of tourists from third countries on our soil and by increased life expectancy. All of this means that we need to draw up a European Union tourism policy which is appropriate for this day and age; we must also review its strategic objectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Queiró highlighted the need for a classification of hotel facilities. I fully agree with him, and I would add that European quality and safety standards should also be established for tourist products.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must respond to our citizens’ new requirements as beneficiaries and consumers of tourism services. From this point of view, I would just cite two examples from among the many novel ideas contained in the Costa report: an ‘Access for all’ label that would guarantee accessible facilities for tourists with reduced mobility, and the European tourist programme for retired people.</p>
      <p sl="it">Allow me to make one concluding remark about training: we should also think about specific individual qualifications for workers involved in tourism for retired people and for the disabled.</p>

      <p sl="pt">While we accept and value many of the aspects covered by this report, we must intervene in this debate to stress, firstly, that tourist activity and high-quality tourism require the professions involved in this sector to be governed by legal regimes which protect labour rights and promote quality jobs and worker qualification. In our opinion this implies, among other aspects, appropriate vocational training, improvement of working conditions, promotion of stable contractual arrangements and fair and dignified levels of pay.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, we would stress that tourism can contribute to territorial cohesion, economic development and regional employment which is why a cross-sector approach must be adopted in the Community policies and funds for this area, in particular by setting up a specific Community programme to complement the actions of the Member States. These points form the content of some of the proposals that we have tabled and which we hope will be supported by this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we do not often deal with tourism in this House and I am therefore particularly grateful to Mr Costa, the rapporteur. I should like to congratulate him on a job well done.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Visa policy is mentioned in the report too. I consider this to be a crucial matter, and we should pay great attention to monitoring the issue of visas and the operation of border crossings on the territory of the new Schengen countries. Russia and Ukraine have expressed concerns regarding the issue of visas to drivers, including coach drivers, and to couriers. Indeed, only yesterday Mr Barroso received the head of the Association of International Road Carriers of Ukraine, who voiced their concerns. I am familiar with the situation and referred the matter to Mr Frattini a month ago. So far no reply has been forthcoming. I consider this to be an important matter. It is essential for Parliament and the Commission to focus on monitoring implementation of visa policy.</p>

      <p sl="it">The deadlock surrounding the Constitutional Treaty has had a knock-on effect in the tourism sector which, according to the approach under discussion, should become a Community policy. The individual Member States have in recent years pursued tourism strategies that have, in general, led to overall growth in this sector within the 27 countries’ individual socio-economic settings. The number of tourists has risen, investment has been injected and staffing requirements have grown, with manifestly positive effects on employment. What has been lacking until now is a clear, comprehensive plan on the part of the Community institutions. Competition between countries is increasing and substantial new offers are clearly becoming available in various parts of the world. Under these circumstances Europe must show that it is up to scratch: in other words, it must rise to the serious challenges looming on the horizon and overcome them.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Globalisation, demographic changes and increased transport are contributing significantly to the rapid growth in tourism, which has great potential for growth and employment. Tourism currently contributes approximately 4% to the EU’s GDP, and indirectly more than 10%, and accounts for about 12% of all jobs.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Tourism encourages people to understand each other better, it promotes the formation of European identity and, through relationships among social, economic and cultural groups, it encourages dialogue between cultures. Establishing a model for European tourism is of primary importance for the Union, since it must be built on values linked to the quality and sustainability of tourism objectives and to equal access for all.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Simplification of the rules, harmonisation of policies that concern tourism, and extending the use of the European financial instruments available must be actively promoted. The development of tourism must be sustainable; in other words, it must respect local communities and environmental protection. In order to do this, we need a support framework and an effective structure involving all the interested regional and local parties, within which partnership and effective leadership will become easier. For the measures implemented in order to achieve the goals, we must bear in mind the fundamental principles of subsidiarity, which define the division of responsibility among the individual parties concerned.</p>

      <p sl="sk">From the point of view of sustainable, integrated regional and local development, tourism has considerable impact on the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU-27. It also plays an important role in increasing employment in less-developed European regions, thus helping to iron out regional disparities. Also, even though it has not yet been possible to develop a consistent cross-policy approach to tourism at EU level, we cannot allow Europe to lose its market share in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Commission, together with the Member States and regional councils, should encourage and financially support new forms of tourism, such as eco-tourism, agricultural tourism, social and health tourism. I view this as one of the tools for ensuring sustainable development of the regions, with emphasis on protection of natural and cultural heritage and its preservation for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Tourism must be better supported by information campaigns. SMEs, primarily tourism business start-ups and those offering new tourism products or developing economic activity in new localities or tourist regions, must have better access to information and be able to make use of available European funding programmes through the Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also want to emphasise the need to exchange experience gained through tourism projects already put into practice, which offer an opportunity to learn from incorrect approaches used in unsuccessful projects and to avoid similar errors in other European regions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Developments in recent years have shown that European tourism, like any other economic sector, is strongly influenced by wider global conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to respond to these challenges successfully, more intensive coordination of national policies is essential. Entirely in line with the subsidiarity principle, Member States must utilise the opportunities available at EU level in order to augment their existing national policies. In this way, the EU can make an effective contribution to curbing burgeoning bureaucracy and dismantling obstacles within the tourism sector by means of harmonisation. Our aim must be to make efficient use of available resources and utilise all the opportunities to create synergies in order to boost the EU’s global competitiveness and create more jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">An important step, in this context, would be to simplify visa procedures and reduce the costs for tourist visas in all the EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also urge the EU to adopt uniform quality standards for hotel accommodation in Europe in order to enhance transparency and, at the same time, to strengthen the rights of consumers. This must not lead to any lowering of national quality standards, however, but should send out an important signal to consumers. The EU must utilise its existing opportunities to provide active support to Member States in this context without, however, calling existing national competences into question.</p>

    <intervention id="3-244" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for giving its support to the Commission proposal from last August. As the rapporteur, Mr Arif, emphasises in his report, Lebanon is in a very difficult situation both politically and economically. Its need for funding is acute. With this macro-financial assistance, the European Union is acting on the pledge it made at the international donor conference last January in Paris, when we agreed to give financial support to Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you know, the operationalisation of the financial assistance is beset by considerable uncertainties due to the political and constitutional crisis which has not yet been overcome. Nonetheless, the Commission is keeping to its pledge to complete all the necessary internal procedures so that the assistance can come on-stream as soon as circumstances permit.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our talks with the Lebanese authorities on the political conditions to be linked with the programme are nearing a conclusion and I can assure you that these conditions will be in full conformity with the EU-Lebanon Action Plan established within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and with the Lebanese authorities’ medium-term economic reform programme. We will of course be utilising all available means in order to minimise, as far as possible, the risk of fraud, corruption and financial abuse, as called for in the draft report.</p>
      <p sl="de">I note that the rapporteur is proposing various amendments to the Commission proposal. We will look at these amendments very carefully and give our opinion to the Council. However, I can already tell you that we will not be raising any objections to most of the amendments on the legal provisions themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission is aware that, at the hearings about new financial assistance, Parliament had to react to very short deadlines. The timetable for all the institutions involved has been tight, due to the specific nature of this financial assistance as a crisis instrument.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, in order to ease the situation and improve cooperation with the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the Commission pledges in future to inform the INTA Secretariat systematically, and in advance, of any new financial assistance transactions; this will be done by means of an information memorandum as soon as new financial assistance is in prospect.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present this report to you today on the allocation of macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Lebanon. This is testimony to the EU pledge to help the country recover from successive crises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lebanon is currently one of the world’s most debt-ridden countries, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 180%. The impact of the civil war between 1975 and 1990, the 2006 summer crisis with Israel, chronic political instability and an economic policy set adrift have caused a serious economic, financial and social crisis. The reality of this situation calls for urgent action to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It transpires that funds in connection with the adoption in January 2007 of the EU-Lebanon Action Plan as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy will not be available until 2009. The exceptional MFA we are set to adopt will bridge that gap and will have an immediate impact on public finances and the balance of payments in Lebanon, provided it is implemented immediately. The MFA will consist of a donation of 30 million euros and a loan of 50 million euros to help the Lebanese Government take on post-war reconstruction and continue its economic revival.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My report fully approves the need to secure this financial assistance for Lebanon. It does, however, introduce a number of amendments to the Council’s proposal for the sake of clarity and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First and foremost, we ought to bear in mind that the assistance must be strictly complementary to the finance agreed by the Bretton Woods institutions, the Paris Club, bilateral donors and the EU under other programmes. It must be coherent with EU external action or policies and guarantee the added value of the Community undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council will also need to explicitly and publicly take up Parliament’s recommendations as to the conditions and criteria attached to the assistance, in other words improved transparency and increased sustainability of public finances, application of the budgetary and macro-economic priorities defined, implementation of specific measures to prevent any risk of fraud, corruption and misuse of funds, distribution of assistance with a fair balance among post-conflict expenditure, reconstruction, excessive debt and the social needs of the population, and full compliance with international democratic and human rights standards and the fundamental principles of the rule of law. Provision of aid for Lebanon must be accompanied by real progress on the objectives mentioned, and this must be set out in a grant agreement drawn up jointly with the Lebanese authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to our basic work on this text, I also wish to mention some of the difficulties encountered while the report was being drawn up, given its urgent nature. It is for this reason that, for any future decision relating to the granting of MFA, the Commission and the Council must provide us with much more notice. For Parliament to carry out its work satisfactorily, it must have better-quality information in good time. In this regard, implementation of an early warning system by the Commission would ensure faster handling of the dossier by the competent committee in Parliament and avoid unnecessary delays which might have a serious negative impact on the final beneficiary of the financial aid. The quality and coherence of our work and the quality of our cooperation with the other institutions rely heavily on this factor.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In line with previous Parliament resolutions, I wish to stress that such a substantial instrument cannot be simply regarded as exceptional. It must have a regular legal basis and cannot be based on ad hoc Council decisions for each operation. A framework regulation on MFA, laid down under the codecision procedure, is necessary in order to enhance transparency, accountability, monitoring and reporting systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also make rapid arrangements for interinstitutional discussions as to the most suitable legal basis for this kind of instrument. In the case of MFA for Lebanon, one of the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and also classified as a developing country, we feel that the legal basis for this action should have been Article 179 of the EC Treaty instead of Article 308 of the EC Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is precisely because Lebanon is a developing country that Parliament insists on not neglecting the social aspect of the reforms that the Lebanese Government might undertake. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), nearly 24% of Lebanese live in complete destitution, and 52% of Lebanese are considered underprivileged. Moreover, nearly 9% of the population are illiterate, less than one-third of the population reach primary school level, and only 13% of Lebanese reach university.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Despite this reality, it must be said that the social question is not currently at the centre of Lebanese political debate, and the social content of envisaged reform is extremely limited with respect to economic and financial concerns. It is, however, in the interests of Lebanon and its partners, as I have already said, to find a fair balance between the various items of expenditure, particularly funds for education and training. It must be borne in mind that persistent social inequalities may have serious economic and political consequences which could prolong the country’s instability.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Lebanon is in an extremely serious and tense situation and it is clear that a way out from the institutional crisis in that country must be found. With this in mind, a working group from the Committee on Foreign Affairs will next week visit the country to do what this Parliament has always done: bear witness to the solidarity of our institution with the cause of peace, understanding, harmony, reconciliation and democratic consolidation in that country.</p>
      <p sl="es">It was precisely with this aim in mind that Mr Arif produced his report on macro-financial assistance for Lebanon. I must say to him that, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we did not want to get too bogged down in technicalities given the extremely serious and tense situation in Lebanon, as I have said, following the succession of President Lahoud. However, we obviously did want to ensure full respect for the competence of Parliament as an arm of the budgetary authority, maximum clarity and transparency as the rapporteur was proposing, and therefore correct and effective use of the funding, thus avoiding any kind of corruption, as indicated by Commissioner Verheugen in his speech.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this context, we believe that this macro-financial assistance falls within the spirit of the association agreement, or the association between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries, within the future framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and, of course, within the obligations made in the agreements of the Paris III Conference on the reconstruction and recovery of Lebanon. It also falls within the spirit of the agreements made with the international institutions.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I note with satisfaction that the responsible committee has adopted the proposals we tabled. It was very courageous of the Committee to propose the new concept of ‘the availability period of financial assistance’ and interpret it in such a way that the validity of the legal act could be prolonged simply through comitology committee procedure. The Commission is just an executive body and cannot have the role of legislator. Such it would become if it should decide on how long financial assistance should last.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On the Committee on Budgets I note with satisfaction that the responsible committee has adopted a positive position regarding our proposal for an amendment to the legal basis, although that would only be done in respect of future proposals on macro-financial assistance. A more proper legal basis we feel is Article 179 of the EC Treaty and not the general Article 308 which has now been used. We hope that the Commission and the Council will in future take account of this message from Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the current institutional vacuum in Lebanon constitutes a major threat to the country and the region in general. With a non-functional parliament, its members in fear of their lives, a destabilised government and a paralysed economy, Lebanon must now find a way out of this crisis. More than ever, the EU must also remain alert in support of its neighbour and ally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The macro-financial assistance proposed today by the EU is more welcome than ever before. This exceptional assistance with a time limitation, aiming to rectify the budgetary situation of a country where agreed efforts to reduce the burden of debt were destroyed by the murderous conflict of the summer of 2006, falls fully within the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. It is not, therefore, a traditional form of assistance as this budgetary support will help enhance Lebanon’s political and economic sovereignty and independence. Assistance must, of course, be subject to an anti-fraud mechanism for greater transparency in the administration and disbursement of funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also ensure better coordination of the financial institutions working to rebuild the country. We must, in fact, implement the neighbourhood instrument, IMF measures and FEMIP actions in a coherent fashion to guarantee effective and sustainable assistance. As the Annapolis Conference opens up a window of hope, Lebanon remains a key factor for peace and stability in the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is true that Lebanon had financial difficulties before the conflict with Israel in the summer of 2006, but that war was, perhaps, the straw that broke the camel’s back. Lebanon, as Mr Arif has said, is now one of the most indebted countries in the world and, according to the UNDP, almost one in four Lebanese lives in complete destitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have in Lebanon, despite the problems that it faces, a government determined to bring about economic stability. In such a situation, it is right that we should be prepared to provide macro-financial assistance to assist in that recovery. Mr Arif is right to argue for safeguards to ensure that we have appropriate policies for tackling corruption and to make sure that funding is not abused. The right mechanism for doing that is through absolute transparency in the granting and spending of the money, proper monitoring of expenditure and ex-post evaluation of the measures taken.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lebanon, as the Commissioner has indicated, has become one of the EU’s partner countries in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The money from that policy will not be available until 2009 or 2010, but when that funding does become available I look forward to the EU assisting in the social and economic reforms in Lebanon. In the interim, macro-financial assistance can make a big difference in helping Lebanon tackle its indebtedness and help bring stability to its government. I therefore welcome it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we are today debating macro-financial assistance for Lebanon. The latter is in the midst of the most serious economic and political crisis to befall it since the end of the war in 1990. The House has heard, from many independent experts on the problems of the Middle East, that the European Union should actively support the democratic authorities in Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Lebanon is now at a particularly important juncture. It is at a stage when the last ghosts of war may finally be laid to rest. There is also a danger, however, that all the old conflicts will break out again. We should therefore use the instruments available to us and play an active mediating role helping to resolve Lebanon’s internal conflicts. The conflict between Israel and Lebanon caused enormous damage in a country that had just managed, with great difficulty, to rebuild its infrastructure after 20 years of war. The conflict also had a negative impact on social relations in Lebanon. It led to a strengthening of radical forces, thus plunging Lebanon anew into internal cross-community conflict.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Lebanon needs time to stabilise again. It needs mediation between all parties. The financial assistance provided by the European Union and by other countries and institutions will provide an opportunity for the Lebanon to get back on course towards reform. Reform is bound to take time, but will result in the emergence of a country that is politically, socially and economically stable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I welcome the Commission’s initiative and the fact that Members of the House have taken the issue of macro-financial assistance on board. This allows us to send out a signal to the people of Lebanon assuring them that the European Union considers itself to be their partner. I should therefore also like to thank the rapporteur for so skilfully endeavouring to involve Parliament in the decision-making process regarding assistance to Lebanon. Finally, we must remember that rebuilding Lebanon is just as much in our interest as Europeans as it is in the interests of the people of Lebanon.</p>

    <intervention id="3-254" speaker_id="4384" name="Alain LIPIETZ" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="France" birth_date="19-09-1947" birth_place="Charenton" p_group="Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is quite an important report just before the Bali Conference.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are aware that international trade is developing at twice the speed of gross world product. This means it is causing growth in the transport industry, one of the most prolific producers of greenhouse gases. It is also enabling the relocation of production, which can be good in terms of using workforces and applying wage regulations, but, given that it takes no account whatsoever of the cost of greenhouse gases produced by this division of labour, it may accelerate the production of greenhouse gases and climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To give you just one set of figures: ships, which carry 40 times more freight than planes, produce only twice as much greenhouse gas, but we still use planes to transport our goods to optimise the production cycle. I therefore feel that, further to the Stern Report and the four reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we should be aware that it is worth waiting half a day or even three more days for a product to arrive at its destination, rather than destroying our climate at a price the Stern Report estimates as 5 000 billion dollars.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Beyond this comment, the report makes an attempt to open up certain avenues. Obviously there are certain avenues relating to transport. We are pleased with the recent vote on the addition of the aviation industry to the European quota system. The report encourages reflection on industrial organisation to reduce the geographic scale of production chains – producing in closer proximity to the end user – and makes a number of proposals in relation to trade in environmental commodities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are proposing, within the context of the WTO and the bilateral or bi-regional agreements – in other words, all the agreements we are currently negotiating – is to prioritise the assessment of the effects on climate change within the assessment made by these agreements of the environmental effects. We also suggest prioritising a considerable reduction in all tariff and non-tariff barriers – and here we are thinking about royalties in particular – that hinder trade in own goods and services which are the ones that can reduce the production of greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All this must evidently be carried out within the most multilateral context, with the WTO if possible, in the absence of any bi-regional agreements currently being negotiated by Europe. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that, after 2012, in the initial post-Kyoto phase, mankind will not have reached a unanimous agreement on the fight against climate change. In this case, Europe’s decision to lead the fight against climate change will definitely hit some of its sectors. It will not hit all of them. In many cases, being the leader of the fight against climate change provides a competitive edge. In some cases, and here I am thinking specifically of the cement industry, this could pose enormous problems and could even lead to cement tourism. In that case, when all the possibilities of multilateral agreements have been exhausted, we suggest adopting the GATT’s Article 20, in other words, border adjustment taxes to restore fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This, ladies and gentlemen, forms the basis of my proposals.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful for the initiative of the Committee on International Trade in addressing issues relating to trade and climate change.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report by Alain Lipietz is a useful source of policy ideas and proposals. We are pleased with this report, because it recognises the interconnectedness of the various aspects of the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="el">Climate change is a very serious issue which, essentially, affects all sectors, including trade. We must endeavour to define a mutually supportive and coherent policy. The European Union aims to facilitate trade, ensuring that it is viable and also that it contributes to other policies, such as the policy on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="el">We welcome the fact that the report recognises the prospects for negotiation on environmental goods and services. We believe that this represents an important contribution by trade to the climate change targets. We hope to see progress on this issue during the current round of multilateral trade negotiations for the Doha Development Agenda. We are pleased about the recognition of the need for the environment agreement secretariats to acquire observer status at the World Trade Organisation, which is something we tried to achieve for the current round of trade negotiations. We are also pleased about the recognition of the contribution that can be made by our new free trade agreements to questions of climate change, through special provisions.</p>
      <p sl="el">The links between opportunities for access to new markets, i.e. for increased trade flows, and policies on climate change, are obvious.</p>
      <p sl="el">Environmental policies provide a strong incentive for technological innovation and promote economic performance. Scientific and economic data show very clearly that the benefits of containing climate change outweigh the cost of reduction policies.</p>
      <p sl="el">The adoption of further measures to combat climate change may result in significant competitive advantages for producers in countries with restrictions on carbon emissions, because – in combination with other policies – it will lead to lower consumption of valuable resources, and to environmentally friendly technological innovation, for which the market access opportunities are increasing. In this way we shall arrive at a situation which benefits everyone, in terms both of competition and of the environment. We must continue to seek out further opportunities to strengthen the positive contribution made by trade policy towards combating climate change.</p>
      <p sl="el">I note that the report includes in this context the issues of export credit, progressive elimination of trade subsidies with a negative impact on the climate, and the strengthening and broadening of market access for direct foreign investments. All these are interesting issues which we can discuss in greater detail.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must also continue our efforts on sustainability criteria in relation to forestry products, deforestation and illegal tree felling.</p>
      <p sl="el">To conclude, let me thank you once again for this valuable contribution to the discussion on climate change at a very important time, when we are only days away from the start of the Bali Conference on climate change, which we hope will provide the motivation for negotiations on an international post-2012 agreement.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, it is high time that world trade faced up to its climate responsibility. Since 1990, world trade has grown exponentially. What is the result of this from a climate point of view? Obviously, increases in transport and emissions. Is it reasonable, for example, that the EU’s livestock farmers should import millions of tonnes of soya from Brazil for the European meat industry, or that fish should be caught in Norway, shipped out to China for filleting and cleaning and then back to Europe for preservation? No, of course not!</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our excellent opinion gives us an opportunity to take concrete measures to deal with this. We demand that transport should bear its environmental cost. We want to disseminate green technology to the developing countries, for example, by making fundamental changes to patent and intellectual property rights. We want to abolish subsidies to dirty energy production. We want to have compulsory environmental certification of biofuels and we want all trade agreements to be assessed from a climate perspective. These are just a few examples from this excellent report. By achieving these things, we can ensure that world trade becomes part of the solution and not part of the problem.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . − Thank you for the floor, Madam President. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the connection between two of the themes discussed by the report before us are extremely topical. The connection between certain forms of trade and climate change is ever more obvious. It is indisputable that intensive international trade gives rise to numerous harmful consequences, including an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, while reducing plant habitats which absorb greenhouse gases. Despite all this, I am convinced that free trade is not in itself identical to environmental damage. The spread of trade and the international division of labour does increase production efficiency, over and above the negative effects. This can result in us consuming fewer energy sources in total.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, to highlight three thoughts in this vein from the opinion prepared by our Committee. Firstly, it is essential that the commercial barriers to environmentally friendly technologies are removed as quickly as possible. Such action will require the European Union to take an active role in the international climate change negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Secondly, we must strive for the price of products in future to reflect harmful consequences that are not immediately noticeable, including impact on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thirdly and finally, we feel that discussions of suitable depth on the relationship between trade and climate change are of primary interest to the Community. Rather more so since Europe can play a leading role in the export of green products and services to the world.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, as is also apparent from the above points, the members of the Committee on Industry are unanimous in their opinion that both removing barriers to trade and action against climate change can only be brought about with the broadest possible international collaboration. The discussions within the Committee have confirmed for us that, with regard to climate change, trade is not only the problem but also part of the solution. Thank you very much, Madam President.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union must take a leading position – as to a large extent it has succeeded in doing – in the adoption of environmentally friendly policies. In this respect, your own contribution, Mr Dimas, has been substantial. The adaptation of all sectoral strategies to sustainable development models is, in any case, a primary regulatory target.</p>
      <p sl="el">The strengthening of international trade is considered to contribute to world economic development and indeed to benefit not only the developed but also the developing countries. The rapidly increasing volume of cross-border trade flows, however, is a challenge to climate policy. The limits of the mutually supportive or antagonistic relationship between the world trading system and policies on climate change are the subject of the report we are discussing. Unfortunately, an imbalance can be seen in the report between the commercial and the environmental component. The rapid development of international trade ought to be treated exclusively as a factor causing environmental stress. Furthermore, the adoption of climate policies is not, in itself, enough; there is a need for a coherent overall plan reflecting environmentally friendly preferences in the policies on transport, trade, industry, energy and agriculture. In any case, the Union’s effort alone is not enough to combat climate change. The Union’s world lead in establishing models of environmental and social protection must be continued and promoted in its trade relations with countries outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="el">Ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution contains some key points. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats has decided that a final vote in favour of the motion should be dependent on the outcome of the votes on these points.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when it comes to climate change, trade is often seen as part of the problem, and it is true that some trade simply cannot be justified. Sending Scottish prawns to Thailand to be peeled and returned to Scotland is just nonsense, and a waste of energy. However, as Mr Lipietz’s well-argued report demonstrates, trade can also be part of the solution. I will take just three brief examples.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the setting of high energy-efficiency standards in Europe for household goods such as fridges, dishwashers, microwave ovens and so on can not only lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions here, but also create the conditions for higher standards elsewhere. For example, a single factory in China produces 80% of the world’s microwave ovens. It is unlikely to want to produce to one standard for Europe and another for elsewhere in the world, or even, for that matter, for its domestic market.</p>
      <p sl="en">A second example mentioned by the Committee on Industry is green goods or, to use their proper name, environmental goods and services. If we eliminate the tariffs on environmental goods and services, we can encourage trade in products that help third countries reduce their carbon footprint, such as the export of energy-efficient generators, wave technology and solar panels. Let us again take the example of China. China is currently increasing its electricity-generating capacity every year by the equivalent of the UK’s total capacity. Clearly, encouraging China to use the latest and most efficient technology could play an important part in allowing it to continue its growth without experiencing a proportionate increase in its carbon footprint.</p>
      <p sl="en">A third and final area would be to empower consumers to make informed choices on what products they buy, through the provision of clear information on the carbon footprint of each product. However, we must be careful to ensure that the information is properly calculated and presented. The ‘food miles’ labels currently used by some UK supermarkets are unsatisfactory and can give misleading information. Flowers from Kenya, for example, have a much smaller carbon footprint than flowers grown in hothouses in Holland, but a glance at the label would lead one to a different conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in this debate on the impact of world trade on climate change, I should like to draw attention to the following matters.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, as a world leader in efforts to combat climate change, the European Union is calling for a reduction of between 25% and 40% in global greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. It should be borne in mind, however, that if the European Union achieves these emission reductions mainly as a result of its own action, with little contribution by other countries, the European Union’s economic development might be threatened.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, economic entities that are subject to various restrictions in Europe as part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can no longer compete with entities operating in countries where no such restrictions apply. Many sectors and types of production have ceased to exist in Europe due to unfair competition from producers in South-West Asia and South America.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, following the introduction of restrictions relating to excessive greenhouse gas emissions on the territory of the European Union, we have witnessed the relocation of manufacturing outside Europe, where no such restrictions exist. As a result, many jobs in Europe will be lost forever.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fourthly, if no agreement on limiting greenhouse gas emissions is reached at global level, and the European Union is determined to move forward on its own, compensatory taxes should be imposed at the Union’s border. This should apply in particular in those sectors in which competition is already seriously affected as manufacturing costs have not taken account of environmental costs. Whenever possible, the so-called climatic dimension of trade exchange must also be taken into account in bilateral trade exchange agreements between the European Union and third countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The same arrangements should apply to ventures supported by the European Investment Bank. In the case of support by different types of undertakings, these arrangements should also be implemented by national agencies charged with guaranteeing export credits and direct investment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Al Gore claims that the debate on global warming is over and that it has been proved beyond doubt that human activity is responsible for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I suggested recently in committee that the sun’s enormous influence on the earth’s climate over millions of years could not be ignored in this debate, and that the sequence of long ice ages, interspersed with short interglacial periods, was the most likely explanation. I received a very hostile reception.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the chairman, Mr Markov, insisted that it was not appropriate to urge excision of a view that happened to conflict with current orthodoxy. Let us remember that, when Galileo declared in the 17th century that the earth revolved around the sun, he was threatened with torture by the Catholic Church for daring to contradict the accepted fact that the earth was at the centre of the universe. It took the church until 1992 to agree that Galileo had been right.</p>
      <p sl="de">The only CO2 at issue in the global warming debate is the trivial amount produced by burning fossil fuels. That comparatively small amount is the only modern and unusual addition to the vast quantities constantly being produced by all living things and all decaying organic matter, and through volcanic activity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Before we risk ruining the world’s economies with carbon emission taxes and the like, please let us reopen the debate and make absolutely sure who is right.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable colleagues, as we deal with this draft report, we should concentrate on the real issue, namely trade and climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, in his first draft, the rapporteur did not manage to produce positive economic and socially compatible proposals as to how we can tackle this problem. In my view, there is far too much confusion, both by the rapporteur and in the report itself, between the issue of trade and the issue of transport. It is not world trade that is the problem, nor the worldwide division of labour; and nor is the problem the fact that thanks to trade, regions that have been or are still poor are now experiencing economic growth. No, our problem, surely, is that transport is not efficient and ecologically friendly enough. Our problem, surely, is that due to poverty or low levels of prosperity in some regions of the world, many people and countries cannot afford the climate protection that is necessary and makes ecological and economic sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is only by integrating these regions into world trade that we will achieve a situation in which these people can afford environmental and climate protection. If you face a daily struggle for survival, you are not going to be thinking about environmental or climate protection. It is only through well-functioning world trade that we will be able to sell our modern technologies around the world and thus make a contribution to protecting the climate.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why, in my view, it is more trade, not less trade, that is the proper response to the problems of trade and climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am therefore most grateful to my colleague Georgios Papastamkos for being able to introduce numerous important themes into the committee debate, and I am most grateful that the ALDE Group has tabled various amendments for tomorrow’s plenary that move in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to conclude with a request. In this report, we unfortunately have several points where we have discredited our social market economy. We should find a way to remove these outbursts against our economic system, which has brought prosperity and social security to so many people. I would be grateful if the groups could show some creativity here so that our Group can also vote for this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I must start by congratulating the rapporteur on his detailed work on such a complex issue as the relationship between trade and climate change. Europe has been a global leader in the fight against the worsening of climate change. However, in order to be credible and achieve the proposed objectives, it must reinforce the coherence of its various policies on this issue. In particular, a European trade policy, one of the oldest common policies of the Union, must not and cannot be forgotten. This balance between environment and trade is not easy to achieve and is not being sufficiently achieved, particularly within the World Trade Organization.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the European Union, meeting the climate change objectives requires an effective effort to reduce carbon emissions which will in turn impact on the conditions of production and the respective costs of an increasing number of productive sectors. It is time to ask ourselves whether, in a world of global competition and faced with the problem of the planet’s survival, it makes sense for this effort to combat climate change to be, more than anything, a European effort? Is it acceptable for the emissions of so many sectors to be moved away from European soil to areas of the globe which are environmentally less protected? Can environmental violation be a legitimate source of competitiveness? Is it acceptable for different environmental compliance rules to exist for the main tradable goods at world level depending on the area of the globe where they are produced?</p>
      <p sl="pt">I think not with regard to all these questions. We need to find a balance between the environment, including climate change, and trade which will guarantee a collective, proportional and equitable effort, without excluding anyone, particularly not the main global trade partners. A new balance between the development of the vast impoverished areas of the globe and the planet’s survival must be quickly found through dialogue, mutual respect and determination faced with converging objectives. The effort must be global and we can only hope that, in December in Bali, this process will begin in a serious and committed manner.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that commercial transactions at European and global level have increased significantly in recent years. While this development encourages the economic development of nations, it has a significant impact on climate change. I am therefore expressing, on my own account, my concern about this particular problem. We need to decide how trade policy can contribute positively towards solving the problem of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="el">The target we have set for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 is quite ambitious. I hope we will win this bet, because the cost of losing will be enormous. Here I would like to underline the Commissioner’s contribution and congratulate him on all his initiatives and efforts in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="el">Greater support and a greater effort are needed in the transition to means of transport which are more environmentally-friendly; the promotion of industry which is more climate-friendly; the development of new technologies and the creation of financial disincentives for activities with a negative impact on the climate; effective cooperation between the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and the European Union; and ongoing consultation and the participation of civil society and non-governmental organisations operating in the environmental sector. The European Parliament has an important role to play. I hope the results of the Bali Conference, in December, will send the optimistic messages which we are all hoping for.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is vital to mainstream climate policy for the fight against climate change to be productive. The report being considered is a valuable one indeed and inspires a very necessary discussion: trade policy must form a part of climate policy because growing trade is resulting in more greenhouse gases. On the other hand, trade policy is very specifically effective as a form of climate policy and may, therefore, be part of the solution.</p>
      <p sl="fi">First of all, trade policy has great value in the promotion of environmental technologies. International trade is one of the most effective tools for the transfer of technology transfer. The role of the World Trade Organization is an important one, because it is essential to remove tariffs on green goods and improve the rules on intellectual property. On the other hand, it is intolerable that the WTO still endorses distorting subsidies on fossil fuels, for example, thus obstructing the path to green technology.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For no very good reason the report makes much of the success of Kyoto. Kyoto is full of loopholes, which are in fact aggravating the situation. Unilateral actions distort competition and lead to carbon leakage. Moving emissions from one place to another is not cutting them. Besides, solidarity towards people in developing countries is not to cause their environment to be contaminated. Kyoto leads to environmental exploitation. Climate change is a global phenomenon through and through and calls for global solutions. A global emissions trading scheme with the compulsory commitment of all the industrialised countries and rising economies is therefore absolutely essential.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I completely sympathise with the concern expressed in the report about the fate of forests with the increase in trade. The EU needs to pay special attention to the risk posed by biofuels to forest sinks. The targets for renewable energy sources set by the Commission must not be allowed to accelerate climate change either.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the National Electoral Council has announced that a popular referendum on the proposal for constitutional reform made by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the National Assembly will be held on 2 December 2007. On that day, the people of Venezuela will have the opportunity to exercise their democratic right of decision on the proposed changes that would shape important aspects of the political, institutional, economic and social life of that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is closely following the ongoing constitutional reform process in Venezuela, as well as in other countries in the region. It stresses the importance it attaches to the fact that each new constitution or constitutional reform should reinforce democracy and the rule of law. It also believes that each constitution should be based on a broad popular consensus and adequately reflect the plurality and diversity of each nation. Constitutions should unite people and not divide them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is following with interest the intensive debate on constitutional reform in Venezuela. It has observed that some sectors of Venezuelan society are in favour of the proposed changes, but also takes note of the strong opposition to the reform expressed by other sectors. Those sectors are voicing concerns, notably on aspects of the reform which they consider would – if the reform were approved – entail an increased concentration of powers in the hands of the President, a weakening of democratic control mechanisms and of the existing institutions and a threat to democratic pluralism. Others consider that what is proposed goes beyond a mere reform and implies modification of the fundamental structure of the state.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is aware of the situation and is paying due attention to it. While it considers that it is the people of Venezuela who should themselves pronounce on the reform proposal, it also stresses the importance it attaches to the campaign on the reform being conducted in an open manner and in a spirit of mutual respect. It also expresses the hope that the referendum will take place in a peaceful atmosphere and in a transparent manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that context, it is worth noting that the recent electoral observation mission sent by the European Union to the last presidential election in Venezuela considered that the electoral process in general complied with international standards and national legislation and underlined the peaceful environment in which the elections were held.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the American continent as a whole is the closest to Europe in terms of values, ideals, vision of the world and individuals, their dignity and their rights. What we call the West to my mind clearly includes Latin America.</p>
      <p sl="es">In recent years there have been some positive trends in Latin America as a whole, bringing it ever closer to Europe: pluralist elections and democratic consolidation, growth with more balanced and open economic policies, regional integration processes and very important agreements with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, there are exceptions in this positive panorama: in addition to the traditional one of Cuba, that of Venezuela is now emerging. This country is going through a process of increasing authoritarianism in which freedoms are being restricted, the opposition is being harassed and fear is being created among the people who even suspect that their vote is no longer secret. In this House we regret the closure last May of Radio Caracas Televisión.</p>
      <p sl="es">On Sunday a constitutional referendum will hurriedly be held which aims to introduce an authoritarian and exclusive regime and which proposes to establish what is being termed ‘Socialism for the 21st century’. An until recently very close associate of President Chávez has even termed the process a ‘coup’. I regret that an election observation mission from the European Union has not been officially invited.</p>
      <p sl="es">What is more, this referendum is being held in a climate of violence and tension which has even cost the lives of students who also reject the plan. In recent years, physical and legal insecurity, kidnaps and land occupations have also increased. As a result, for example, many of my Galician compatriots have left the country at the average rate of one thousand people per year since President Chávez came to power.</p>
      <p sl="es">Emboldened by high oil prices, President Chávez is looking for followers and allies in other countries, he is making a lot of noise in international forums and he is intervening in the sovereign affairs of his neighbours. As President Uribe has said, President Chávez wants to set the continent alight. His attitude is a problem for the democratic stability of Venezuela and for harmony and integration processes in Latin America as a whole. He is also disrupting the relations which have been expanding in the last decade between countries on that continent and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Bearing in mind the next Lima Summit, the attitude of President Chávez represents a serious challenge which must be carefully considered by the European Union and its Member States.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the first thing we have to do in this Parliament, in line with its own tradition of respect and non-interference, is not inflame the situation further, either in continents or third countries, as a result of our own words.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Millán Mon is right to say that Latin America has developed very positively in recent years, both politically – as the vast majority of its countries are democratic – and economically, and also, albeit more modestly, in social terms.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe has contributed extensively to this development, through its companies, its investments and particularly its development aid which is the highest in that continent.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this general context, I would not say that there is an exception, but rather that there is a particular situation in Venezuela due to the personality, which is also very particular and very much his own, of President Chávez. However, it must not be forgotten – especially not in a democratic institution such as this one – that President Chávez has been re-elected three times with large majorities and without any justified suspicions of electoral fraud.</p>
      <p sl="es">Under these circumstances – that is to say, we are not talking about a dictatorship – we must tread carefully, try to increase dialogue by extending the hand of friendship and also encourage this country, which admittedly is fractured and divided, to engage in internal dialogue, consensus and reconciliation. We must do this in the belief that a country cannot be transformed with a majority of just 60% or 40% and that the rules of the game cannot be changed without a broad consensus involving at least 70% or 80%, as has occurred in other countries around us and in our old continent, in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Admittedly, the internal situation is very worrying for the reasons that I have set out: the drift or the suspicion of a drift towards authoritarianism; the concentration of power; the successive loss of the division of powers, and also the reduction in freedom of expression using an instrument barely known in Europe which is termed ‘en cadena ’. This allows the President or one of his ministers to commandeer, at any time, all the television channels and all the radio transmitters so that the President’s messages can be broadcast. These do not just last a minute or two. In fact, in exceptional cases, they can go on for several hours a day. In a country where few newspapers are read and where television and radio are the main media, this is a problematic situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I insist – and I will end on this point – that, faced with this referendum, we must be cautious, offer dialogue, hold out the hand of friendship and try to mediate between the two opposing sides in Venezuela.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Venezuela is a country of exceptional natural beauty and is very rich in natural resources. It has some of the world’s largest deposits of oil, coal, iron and gold. Despite its natural riches, the majority of Venezuelans have remained very poor, with far too many living in conditions of appalling poverty. Only a small minority belonging to a rich elite have benefited from the country’s riches.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under those conditions of gross social inequality, it is no wonder that populist politicians like Hugo Chávez have emerged as saviours of the poor. It is also no wonder that Mr Chávez’s nationalisation programme was welcomed by most Venezuelans. They saw Hugo Chávez as someone who was going to lift them out of the misery of poverty and deprivation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same thinking applies to the forthcoming constitutional reform referendum. I am sure that referendum will secure the necessary popular approval, and it is too late now for public opinion to be changed. Therefore, what we will in essence have after 2 December is the emergence of another Fidel Castro. It seems that, just as one totalitarian leader is fading away in Cuba, another is being born in Venezuela. However, in diagnosing that sad reality, we should, perhaps, also ask whether we in the West are in any way to blame for how things are turning out in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must do this not just so that we can be morally and politically correct academically, but also so that we can, in practice, prevent similar occurrences in the future. Sadly, it is apparent that, in our dealings, with Venezuela over the last few years, we have made numerous grave mistakes. Hugo Chávez got to where he is today partly because we have helped him through our foreign policy omissions and commissions. Therefore, in contemplating our strategy on how to deal with him in the future, let us start by saying ‘sorry’ to the Venezuelan people.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am speaking as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Andean Community. As such, I have been visiting Venezuela one or more times a year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since I started going to this country, in other words since the military coup against President Chávez, I have been hearing the Venezuelan media screaming against the President, against the dictatorship. In the hotels I used, even though they had three, four or even five stars, you were not allowed to watch public television, and anyway it is not always possible to do so as it is normally broadcast in a snowy format. The generals behind the coup still stroll around the largest square in Caracas and President Chávez, legally elected, re-elected and re-elected again, has never lifted a finger against them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Venezuela is one of the countries trying to deal, as peacefully as possible, with the conflicts which are commonplace all over Latin America. I am not wholly enamoured with all the changes that President Chávez has tried to make to the Bolivarian Constitution. Having said that, as Mr Matsakis stated, it is the people of Venezuela who will decide.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can certainly make excuses for the way in which we gave the impression that we supported the military coup. It is true that this has helped radicalise the regime in Venezuela. I feel, however, that, first and foremost and above all, we ought to respect the decision of the Venezuelan people.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would ask the European right to stop meddling in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European right does not like Cuba because it says that there are no elections, and yet it does not like Venezuela because there are. In fact, Venezuela is one of the countries in Latin America that has held the most elections, all supervised by the Organization of American States, by the European Union and by foundations as prestigious as the Carter Center.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen of the right, what you do not like is the system. Stop meddling and respect a sovereign people who are freely exercising their will and who will keep doing so. We should not anticipate events. Have we not agreed in the European Union, as Commissioner Dimas has said, that the recent presidential elections were held totally fairly?</p>
      <p sl="es">We must wait and see and respect what the people of Venezuela say without any kind of interference, ladies and gentlemen of the right.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1848 Karl Marx proclaimed Socialism for the 19th century, and it was a disaster. In 1917 Lenin, with the Russian Revolution, proclaimed Socialism for the 20th century, and it was a disaster. Various Members of this House emerged from that disaster to join us in freedom. The problem with Socialism for the 21st century, as proclaimed by President Chávez in Venezuela, is that this century is only just beginning and we do not know what will happen. However, we can imagine that, as in the 19th and 20th centuries, it will also be a disaster.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a matter of fact, we see it resulting in violence. It is not the elections that concern us; it is the brutal violence perpetrated by the authorities against the students protesting in Venezuela because they are not recognised as having the right to demonstrate. Some of these students have died in recent days on the streets of Caracas and other cities. It is the threats to freedom of expression that concern independent and free journalists throughout Latin America and in particular in Venezuela and which led to the closure of Radio Caracas Televisión.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the line that concerns us, and we are right to be concerned as, in the constitutional reform proposed by President Chávez, words such as ‘decentralisation’, ‘private initiative’, ‘freedom of competition’ and ‘social justice’ have given way to words such as ‘Socialism’, ‘Socialist’, ‘imposition of the Socialist State’, ‘elimination of the independence of the Central Bank’ and ‘people’s power’. It is well-known throughout the world that, when someone uses the expression ‘people’s power’, power will be taken away from the people and democracy will be destroyed. This has happened everywhere that the expression ‘people’s power’ has been used. ‘Bolivarian Armed Forces’, ‘communes’, this is the kind of line that should concern us, that has sown instability and violence in recent months and years on the streets of Caracas and that also represents a threat to regional stability if what has recently happened in relations between Venezuela and Colombia should continue. That is why it is essential that we closely monitor events in Venezuela in solidarity with the democratic parties and civil society fighting for regional stability and firmly defending democracy, but also with great cohesion in the European Union’s diplomacy.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Today we signed the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, thereby expressing our commitment to respect for human dignity, democratic values and the rule of law. What has been the basis for the successful growth of the European Union internally is also our starting point for developing relations with our partners throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The European Union as a whole wants closer and stable cooperation with the countries of Latin America and its regional interconnections. In view of the specific nature and genuine interests of the countries of Latin America we believe that it is possible to build strategic and long-term relations only in this manner and with those countries with which we can share the same fundamental values and principles.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Political development in Venezuela has recently deviated from the abovementioned course. It is thereby undermining the dynamics and scope of future cooperation between Latin America and the European Union and the dynamics of integration within Latin America itself. The referendum on the constitution is polarising Venezuela because the new proposals concentrate political power and will not lead to an open, ideological and democratic society. We believe in social society, not socialist society, because that dismisses those who think differently.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Unbelievable! The European Parliament has put on the agenda a Commission statement on the constitutional reform planned for 2 December in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela when what should be on the agenda is a debate on the current attempt to deny all the people of the EU Member States the right to be consulted, by way of a referendum, on the so-called ‘constitutional’, ‘mini’, ‘simplified’, ‘reform’ or now ‘Lisbon’ Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In essence, putting this debate on the agenda is an attempt to respond to those who support and promote an unacceptable and extremely serious policy of interference in and attempted destabilisation of a sovereign state, particularly when this is a process that only the Venezuelan people can decide, by giving their opinion through a referendum (!) on the amendment of their country’s Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Without doubt the Venezuelan Government and people are an example which worries the major financial and economic interests established in the European Union: an example of the assertion of national sovereignty and independence; an example of the realisation of a plan for patriotic emancipation and development; an example of international and anti-imperialist solidarity; an example of what it is worth fighting for and that it is possible to have a fairer, more democratic and peaceful country and world.</p>
