      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Buşoi, Heide Rühle, Adam Bielan and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the transposition of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications (O-0108/2009/rev.2 - B7-0217/2009).</p>

    <intervention id="4-007" speaker_id="4538" name="Malcolm HARBOUR" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author" nationality="United Kingdom" birth_date="19-02-1947" birth_place="Woking" p_group="European Conservatives and Reformists Group" m_state="GB">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, with your permission, I would propose that we delay a moment or two because this is an oral question to the Commission and we were hoping that Mr McCreevy would be here, but I see that Mr Samecki is going to speak. I have not met Mr Samecki before, so I am interested that he is here to provide an answer to an issue that Mr McCreevy and his team have been working on. Thank you very much.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was going to have welcomed Mr McCreevy here and thanked him for his work previously, so perhaps you will pass on our good wishes for what might have been his final appearance here. Nevertheless, I am particularly pleased that Mr Barnier has joined us as a very active member of my committee to hear this, because this is a dossier which will be very much in his in-tray, assuming of course that the Parliament approves his nomination and the Commission moves forward. It is nevertheless very good that he is here.</p>
      <p sl="en">The free movement of professionals and the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications are among the flagship issues that my committee is most concerned about in the whole construction of the single market. It is very appropriate that we are discussing this question to the Commission this morning, which is essentially to ask for an update on the progress in transposing the revised directive that my committee worked on back in 2004-2005, and on how that is actually being implemented by the Member States. It is also very timely because Professor Monti came to our committee on Monday to talk about his mission for the President of the Commission on the future direction of the internal market. He made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is actually not the lack of legislation, but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, as the text of our question quite clearly sets out, we already know that a significant number of problems in relation to recognition of professional qualifications are encountered by citizens across the European Union. It has one of the highest levels of complaints in the Solvit mechanism that we very much support at member government level. Many people feel frustrated by the absence of clear decisions and also by the lack of contact between authorisation bodies in different Member States. One of the things that our own research has done, and this committee commissioned research on this topic, is to demonstrate the fact that there is nothing like enough coordinated activity on helping people to recognise their rights under mutual recognition. The other aspect is that it is also clear from the work we and others have done that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European qualifications framework. There are serious questions that we need to ask about the mechanism, about how simple it is to access and about how effective it is in practical terms. We know from the statistics and the information – and I am sure we will hear from the Commission shortly – that transposition of this instrument has been delayed in just about every Member State. It has taken much longer than people expected to bring this into operation, and that of itself raises concerns about the complexity of the instrument itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just to pull all these things together in the context of the work of the Internal Market Committee over the next five years, I am delighted that, I think, all the coordinators of the committee are here today and I want to thank them for the work they have done, together with myself, on shaping the forward agenda for this committee. This question of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just a one-off. It is part of our feeling that the role of our committee is to continue to investigate, to promote and to make recommendations about the future evolution of the key legislations, the key building blocks of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that the Commission is due to review the mutual recognition directive in 2011. We plan to have a meeting of national parliaments and national parliamentarians to discuss this proposal. We have already had a hearing on this and we have our research report. These are the instruments that my committee can use and, if the coordinators agree, I am sure that we will be doing an own-initiative report sometime in 2010 to feed into this discussion that the Commission will have.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the context of the question. We look forward to hearing the Commission’s reply to set the framework for that, but this is just the beginning of the process and I am sure that the new Commissioner will be able to take that forward and work with us to really develop this crucial piece of legislation and make the single market work better.</p>

    <intervention id="4-008" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Paweł Samecki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for raising these important questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before responding to the individual questions, let me start with an overview. The objective of the Professional Qualifications Directive is to facilitate the free movement of our citizens in the internal market. Two years after the end of the transposition period, transposition is complete in 22 Member States, and four Member States will hopefully deliver by the end of the year. At this stage I am, however, concerned about Greece, from which we have not received any transposition measure yet.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the first question. The transposition has constituted a challenge for Member States mainly because it affects more than 800 different professions. These professions have often even been regulated in federal or regional laws. However, this cannot be an excuse for any delays, and the Court of Justice has not accepted such delays in six judgments so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the second question, the main problems relate to the health professions and architects, where a higher degree of harmonisation of training requirements at European level is in place. Problems also occur in professions with higher levels of cross-border mobility of workers such as teachers or tourist guides.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the third question, the priority of the Commission is to ensure correct and consistent implementation of the directive. To this end, we have developed a code of conduct on administrative practices and a user guide addressed to citizens, which will also promote more consistency.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to the obstacles which Solvit identified, we are fully aware of problems on the ground, such as delays occurring in the recognition procedure, lack of response from the national competent authorities, unsubstantiated decisions, lost files, etc. Sometimes, erroneous information is even given to migrants and they are invited to follow wrong procedures. However, the Solvit network has proven to be effective in solving many of these problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there is not only Solvit. National contact points are now in place in all Member States to inform and assist citizens, and the Commission expects them to be even more active in the future. Moreover, the Internal Market Information System has also provided a medium for supporting more than 1 200 information exchanges for many of the regulated professions this year. This has brought about enhancements in day-to-day administrative cooperation between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the last question, the Commission is not in a position to assess whether there is a need for reform at the moment. This will be done during an ex post evaluation exercise foreseen by the directive. Our intention is certainly to respect the timetable set in the directive. It will be up to the next Commission to decide how to take this forward.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005, we adopted this directive after several years of work and debate in Parliament and it came into force. In 2007, it was implemented. Now we have reached 2009 and it is hard to accept that the directive has not been implemented everywhere, particularly since it was not completely new, because there were already proposals in place. I can only encourage the Commission to exert more pressure on the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I had expected that the problems would lie in the practical management of the directive. That is the main subject of the forthcoming investigations: to find out where there are specific local problems and to discover what is actually happening. There has already been a reference to the fact that 20% of the complaints to SOLVIT concern this subject. This is a very serious matter. Mr Harbour rightly pointed out – and I do not want to repeat what he said – the importance of this problem for the internal market from an economic perspective.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, apart from the economic issues, it is also one of the fundamental freedoms of citizens to be able to exercise their profession and to fulfil their potential in another state, for example, when they marry or move to another country for some other reason. This is a genuine problem for the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important for us to acknowledge that there will inevitably be problems. It is a complex matter, it takes time to implement and different cultures and traditions are involved, particularly with regard to the professions and the concepts of quality and qualifications within those professions. Therefore, it is not possible to recognise every qualification from one country in another country without question. For me and for us, this is less about dealing with the individual cases of hardship which will inevitably occur and more about investigating – and this is where SOLVIT comes in – whether there are faults in the structures or in the system and whether and how improvements can be introduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to point out that it will never be possible to bring this subject to a close. It is a long-running issue because new professions and new job descriptions are, of course, constantly coming into existence. For this reason, this is an ongoing task for the Commission and for Parliament, but also for the Member States, whose goodwill I would like to call on at this point.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission. This shows contempt for Parliament. It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">Yes? Yes, he did not get up. Well, I am sorry. I cannot accept that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work. We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date. I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement. There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament. We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced. This will put into citizens’ hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe. There are organisations which are attempting to do this. However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental rights of the European Union’s citizens. This also includes the free movement of professionals, which is a vital condition for ensuring that the internal market operates as efficiently as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As has been mentioned in all the speeches made so far, in spite of the adoption of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications in 2005, professionals wishing to exercise their right of free movement are still encountering numerous difficulties. I have personally come across various cases of this type, which have been brought to my knowledge not only by Romanian citizens, but also by European citizens, relating to a variety of professions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection did the honour of appointing me as rapporteur for the European Solvit network. As has been mentioned so far, a significant proportion of the cases which Solvit has to resolve are linked to failures in the system for mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe, fellow Members, that we need to analyse in detail the problems which have been submitted to the Solvit centres so that we can see what we can improve.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Better communication is also needed between contact points in order to promote mutual understanding between Member States. They must understand how the other systems work in the European Union so that the maximum possible flexibility can be used when applying the directive, as well as to avoid the administrative obstacles blocking the professionals’ path.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Lastly, it would be desirable for the five Member States which have not yet completed transposition of the directive, or any state among the 22 which has done this but is still having problems with transposition or has transposed it inappropriately, to quickly rectify these situations. The ultimate aim is to facilitate the smooth operation of the internal market for the provision of services which is directly affected by problems relating to the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I think we all agree on the objective here. Of course, we all want the citizens of Europe to be able to move about freely and to exercise their professions. The question is why this directive has still not been properly implemented after four or now nearly five years. I believe it would make sense if the committee was involved not only in drawing up and enacting the legislation, but if it also carried out an analysis afterwards of the reasons why transposition is delayed in this way.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is not the only directive which is causing problems. When there are so many cases in the Court of Justice of the European Union, when there are so many complaints procedures and when SOLVIT is so heavily involved with this subject, this should act as a wake-up call for us. We must look more closely at the reasons behind this. There are a number of causes. On the one hand, it is always very easy to say that the Member States are responsible for the delay. Protectionism is doubtless another of the reasons. The different cultures and legal systems certainly also play a role. What effect does European legislation have on these differing legal systems? That is another issue that we will have to address.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we must consider whether the directive has had the intended effect or whether it was incapable of achieving certain results right from its conception. I believe it is very important that we look at this issue again. This type of ex-ante analysis is one of the important subjects which this committee will have to deal with and make progress on.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I also have questions for the Commission. I am surprised that these guidelines are only appearing after more than four years. This could have been done much earlier. However, I do welcome the guidelines. I have read them and they are certainly helpful. Nevertheless, it would have been useful to have them some time ago. I would like to join with Mrs Gebhardt in asking what is happening about the European professional card. That will be the second important step.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="23788" name="Adam BIELAN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group" nationality="Poland" birth_date="12-09-1974" birth_place="Gdańsk" m_state="PL">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the crisis which has affected the European Union in recent months has shown irrefutably how important the internal market is for the functioning of the entire Union. We will not finish building it without introducing a certain freedom for people to migrate, which is guaranteed, among others, by the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Therefore, it is a sad and disturbing fact that, four years after adoption of the directive, it still is not in force in four countries, and none of the Member States adopted it before the deadline contained in the directive, 20 October 2007.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In relation to this, my first question to the European Commission is as follows: has the Commission not been too passive over the last four years, and what exactly did the Commission do so that all the countries would manage to transpose the directive in time? Secondly, I would like to ask when the Commission will publish a report evaluating transposition of the directive, and what will be used as the basis for the conclusions in the report? The Services Directive should be implemented at the end of the year. Today, in Parliament, we know already that many countries will not manage to pass laws about this in time. I would like to ask what connection the Commission sees between these two documents?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, a very important matter for the country I represent is the question of migration of nurses. The directive introduces harmonisation of training requirements for nurses. I would like to ask what specific action the Commission has taken to help nurses from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including those from Poland?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission for presenting its opinion to us. However, I would also like to point out that, following the interinstitutional agreement between the Commission and Parliament, and I have seen this happen with the Services Directive, which we discussed in Brussels months ago, Parliament has a right to demand that the Commissioner responsible should be here to answer difficult questions. I do not think that we can resolve this issue with this Commission and there is no point in trying to do so.</p>
      <p sl="de">On behalf of Parliament, I would like to explain to the representative of the Commission who is here that we believe that this part of the interinstitutional agreement is extremely important. Why is that? Not for reasons of mere formalism, but because this is a very important political question for the citizens of the European Union. Mr Bielan has just referred to the Services Directive, which can only function if professional qualifications are recognised by both sides. It is of great importance, but many people also connect it with a feeling of helplessness, if they have the impression that their employer is making use of discrepancies in the cross-border mutual recognition of professional qualifications simply to reduce their earnings.</p>
      <p sl="de">These people feel abandoned and helpless. I have seen this myself in a number of cases here on the border between Germany and France. However, this is obviously not the only problem area. It is true that we cannot resolve all the difficulties overnight and that this process will remain an ongoing issue in future, as Mr Lechner, the rapporteur, has said. Nevertheless, it is our job to show the citizens that we take their concerns seriously and, in my opinion, this also includes the Commission attaching sufficient importance to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that we will be able to work together with the new Commission on this in order to make progress. I would like to ask you to arrange this with the Directorate General responsible for this area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive. In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic. Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text. Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account. The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The most obvious example is that of the medical professions. For example, French midwives are authorised to write prescriptions and are trained for that, which is not the case in other countries. What happens when a midwife without such authorisation arrives in France without additional training and has to write a medical prescription? Similarly, certain specialisms do not exist in every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This directive is crucial to the free movement of workers, the foundation on which the European project is based, but it must be improved and enhanced, and the difficulties encountered must serve to identify the professions for which language teaching and harmonised training are necessary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to mention the remarkable initiative, which is supported by all health professionals, to create a European card. This is a genuine guarantee as much for the carrier as for the customer or patient, and I call on the Commission to extend it to other professions, since this will enable us to improve mutual recognition and to gain the citizens’ trust.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when discussing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and the good functioning of the internal market, we have to look at the current situation in the health sector, for which the directive and its implementation may need to be further discussed.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to the full implementation of this directive, it is crucial to introduce further measures applying to mutual recognition, not only of diplomas, but of health professionals’ qualifications as well. The provision of health services requires appropriate linguistic skills, registration through national regulators and, most importantly, the ability to deliver safe and high-quality care.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think there is a need for better sharing of information between Member States regarding health professionals’ registration, for example through a common EU database. A competence assurance system is also a key element of safe health care services provision, and we should think about common standards for the assessment of competences and skills.</p>
      <p sl="en">Health professionals’ mobility is also a question of public health and public safety. On these grounds, the ECJ has already approved additional national safeguards for the circulation of goods. There is also a rationale for such measures applying to the provision of health services, especially when new communication technologies allow controversial practices such as e-doctor consultations. We have to face the challenge of an ageing population, and this will put even more pressure on the European health workforce.</p>
      <p sl="en">While ensuring the mobility of health professionals, we must also be able to guarantee to all European citizens accessible health services, timely delivered with the highest quality standards. This is a responsibility for all of us. I hope that the European institutions and Member States will consider it seriously, given the fact that some national health care systems are almost drained of professionals and this will make it extremely difficult for us to provide basic health care service.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, if we want our citizens to be mobile – and this is what the European economy needs – they have to be sure that when they gain their qualifications, for example, in Poland, they will not have problems with recognition of these qualifications in any Member State. I understand the scale of the problem perfectly. The 800 regulated professions of which Mr Samecki spoke, together with numerous regulations of these professions at national and regional level, are a considerable challenge for the administrations of the Member States. However, the challenge for our citizens who are having problems with recognition of their qualifications is, principally, how to find their feet in the complexities of the entire system. This is confirmed by data from Solvit, and this is why the problem with implementing the directive in time is only one aspect of our discussion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should not, however, forget that many problems are emerging because there is a lack of trust in Member States towards the education and training systems in other Member States. We lack, finally, cooperation, resources and the engagement of national administrations. The introduction of a European professional card is a good idea, and we had the opportunity to discuss this during the previous term of the European Parliament. Such a card must, however, facilitate the flow of people, and not make it more difficult. Introduction of this card – and I would like to stress this very strongly – should not become another barrier in the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, in just under ten days, the deadline for transposition of the Services Directive expires. I mention this because it is also important in the context of our debate today. These two directives complement each other in certain respects. Transposition of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications cannot be called a success, and so I will permit myself once again to appeal from this place for an intensification of work on both directives, because without them, we will not make progress with the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as we are all aware, 15 directives were consolidated into a single legislative act for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. That has given rise to a number of practical problems with transposition in the various Member States. The difficulties are well known, and the Commission should list the sticking points and analyse the problem areas found in the transposition of this important internal market provision.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The protectionism that rears its head at various levels is an obstacle not only to the free movement of persons but also to the internal market. We must try to identify the hazy areas so that the directive is not made less effective through mistrust. We are not asking the Union to do what the Member States should be doing, but an effort is needed to facilitate matters by helping to demolish professional corporatism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To improve the transposition of this directive will require dissemination of the recognition of qualifications via the Solvit and EURES networks, the encouragement of joint platforms, implementation of effective contact points and, no less importantly, the linking of this directive to the Services Directive.</p>

      <p sl="mt">The biggest issue affecting the proper enforcement of this directive is the Member States’ lack of trust in each others’ systems. The Member States’ disinterest in collaborating with each other is also reflected in the incoherent manner in which they perceive the internal market information system. Every Member State claims to use the system, but the frequency of use varies in accordance with the purpose for which it is used. It is impossible for an information exchange system to work properly when the Member States do not use it in the same way. It is necessary to have a full compilation of data which is updated regularly and it is also necessary to create a point of reference for all Member States, where each Member State inputs all necessary data which will allow the concrete application of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I would like to ask the Commission to inform us on the plans of action it intends to adopt for the proper transposition of this directive, if we truly wish to embrace the concept of the single market and not merely interpret it as we deem fit.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, before I go onto my question, there has been a lot of talk this morning about Solvit. At the last IMCO Committee meeting, we were told of the under funding of Solvit centres. You may want to take note of this before your hearing, Mr Barnier, but there is one intern running the organisation in one large Member State. We cannot allow that to go on, because Solvit provides us with an excellent service.</p>
      <p sl="en">My question to the Commission is connected to health care professionals. An impaired professional risks putting patients’ health at risk and, in the most extreme cases, can cause death.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is the Commission considering a legal duty for competent authorities to proactively and effectively share information about struck-off professionals to ensure that the mobility of health care professionals does not compromise patient safety?</p>
      <p sl="en">The current internal market information system allows for the sharing of information, but only when a competent regulator has a question about an applicant to its register, so we have to have a better exchange to alert authorities when an individual has been struck off due to incompetence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you, Mr President, for raising this issue for the committee.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, much has been said about the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. The question is: why is this directive, which is so important and so universally longed-for, difficult to apply? Well, quite simply because it is difficult and complex to apply in everyday, operational terms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I see three main problems: the first is obviously language, a point that has been raised; the second is the complexity of the procedures to be followed to have a person’s qualifications recognised as valid – at times, people have to literally jump through hoops to have their initial diplomas recognised; and the third is perhaps the variety of types of initial training.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, I think it would be a good idea for the Commission to ask the Member States to appoint, for each profession, a single competent professional body to be in charge of continuing training – continuing training being one of the solutions. These competent bodies should be asked to sit as a board, at European level, to define a common European form of certification. In that way, we would gradually see professionals go from an initially heterogeneous level to a common level of continuing training.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Belgium is one of five Member States to have not yet fully transposed the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications. However, according to the information that I have, the only thing it has left to do to comply with European law is to solve the problem of travel professionals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Leaving aside the difficulties inherent in the Belgian institutional system with regard to the transposition of the various European directives, it seems that the directive that we are discussing here is particularly complex. That has already been mentioned. Belgium is not the only country to be affected by the non-transposition, poor transposition or partial transposition of directives. That is why, in the interests of professionals, I call on the European Commission to help those Member States that are having difficulties. Professionals should be able to benefit from the free movement of persons and freedom of establishment which, I would point out, constitute the main objective of this directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, my thanks to Mr Samecki for his good work. I think we all agree with the principle we are discussing here this morning, but it should apply not only across the European Union but worldwide as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is something we discussed recently at the Canadian delegation, which is a step in the right direction. However, if we want that Utopian situation, we must ensure that professional qualifications are of an equal standard across the European Union and, ideally, worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that, in some countries at least, when students have not reached the educational standard to qualify for a course, they can go to another country and pay to do it there.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there is a need for independent verifiable evidence that the standards are equal and, if they are equal, then there is no excuse for not transposing this principle across the European Union and, hopefully, in due course worldwide, to attain what we desire – the free movement of labour for professionals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let us get straight to the point here. The failure of Member States to get their act together in terms of the recognition of qualifications is costing us jobs. The failure of Member States to actually take this seriously enough is a serious issue. Our level of cross-border trade for what is supposed to be a single market is nowhere near what it should be. We are in the process of rebuilding the European economy, and part of this move must involve ways to enhance cross-border trade and make labour more mobile than it is now.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must move to a new area of entrepreneurial innovation, where in Europe we are working together to make the world’s most cutting-edge products. Given that our manufacturing base has dried up – Ireland being a case in point – exporting our services represents a new way of enhancing trade within Europe. However, for this, Europe must have standards when it comes to qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">So far, the failure of Member States to agree on the rules for this matter is limiting our ability to sell these same services across borders. For the individuals involved, it is restricting the free movement of labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with my colleague, MEP Grech, that Member States are not showing enough respect in particular for the information system they use and somebody needs to be held responsible in each Member State for the same. I urge the Commission to identify and tackle the obstacles which are preventing the realisation of the single market in this instance.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to pick out one aspect in this debate. There seems to be a great shortage of specialised professions, which has resulted in a trade in these qualifications and led to genuine qualifications being disregarded. This can entail great risks, both in the security sector, for example, and in large-scale plants such as chemical companies and oil refineries. National supervision in this regard seems to be inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to ask the Commissioner three questions. Firstly, whether he knows about this; secondly, whether the European Commission can give us a report on this; and, thirdly, what we can do about it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is an absolutely ridiculous, undesirable phenomenon that I believe must be eliminated.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Ladies and gentlemen, this is really a very important issue that we are dealing with here, that of mutual recognition of professional qualifications within the European Union. This is a major problem because qualifications are granted by the education systems of EU Member States, of which there are at least 27.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Some of you will probably recall that, in March last year, we established the European Qualification Framework, which is a mechanism enabling comparison between education systems. However, one problem with this qualification framework is that it has not been implemented by the Member States. Some of them have not implemented it fully and some have used it merely as a convenient translator of various qualifications, occupations, skills and educational levels.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In my opinion, a major task lies ahead for the Member States in this particular area and, if they were really to enforce the European Qualification Framework, which was previously adopted at European institution level, they would greatly facilitate the comparison and the real mutual recognition of educational qualifications.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, my apologies for not standing up during my first intervention. It is because of a lack of experience and the early morning hour.</p>
      <p sl="en">In general, I would like to refer to a couple of selected questions. First of all, we should underline that the Commission has been supporting Member States in preparing the transposition of the directive. Where the transposition period has lapsed, we have also been vigorous in enforcing transposition. In 2007, we published a transposition guide. Then we developed the internal market information system, which is now used quite intensively by all Member States, and we also published a code of conduct on administrative practices in June this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">A year ago, the Commission brought non-compliant Member States to the European Court of Justice, and the Court of Justice issued six favourable judgments condemning the lack of transposition by the Member States concerned. Very recently, we published a scoreboard illustrating the state of transposition in the Member States, as well as a user guide for citizens and the business community.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to thank you for all the questions and comments, and especially the Chair, Malcolm Harbour, for his valuable input. We believe that it is up to the Member States to deliver now. The Commission is looking forward to developing a special relationship with Parliament also as regards this file. In particular, we are ready to actively discuss how the directive works in practice, and how to take best account of a swiftly changing environment in the coming years.</p>

      <p sl="de">One stated goal of this directive is to implement fully the current legal provisions concerning the freedom of movement of professionals within the EU. The free movement of professionals has already been adopted in Directive 2005/36/EC. However, problems are occurring repeatedly, particularly in regions near national borders. Many people in the region I come from work in Luxembourg, Belgium or France. I receive numerous enquiries from citizens who cross into one of the neighbouring countries to work. These enquiries often relate to the recognition of professional qualifications. This situation must change. Agreements have been reached by the professional organisations for specific professions, but this does not help in every case and all too often, citizens have to fight to have their qualifications recognised. It becomes particularly difficult when a particular country does not have a specific profession or that profession is organised differently, for example, physiotherapists or people with a PhD in business administration. At the same time, many areas are short-staffed. Nurses or toolmakers, for example, must, in future, have better opportunities on our labour markets and, above all, the internal market must function effectively as far as work is concerned. We need a transparent, simple and clear recognition procedure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, three years ago, a major reform of European cohesion policy was introduced taking into account the unprecedented enlargement of the Union and new emerging challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was not by chance that, back in 2005 and 2006, the top priorities for European cohesion policy were: the Lisbon strategy, innovation and competitiveness, climate change, energy security and efficiency, water efficiency, investment in new skills, attractiveness of territories for young people, and quality of life.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is because we have understood that the mission of cohesion policy is to anticipate change, not to follow it, that we have put on the cohesion policy agenda for 2007-2013 all those priorities which we see today in the Commission’s Europe 2020 agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why, more than two years ago, the Regions 2020 analytical report was published. The purpose was to know what the cohesion policy priorities should be after 2013. Today, we are well prepared to face the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">A year ago, the policy put all its assets at the disposal of the European Recovery Package, thereby also providing the essential link between the exit strategy from a real economic crisis, on the one hand, and long-term sustainable growth and structural transformation on the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">But our oral question is about the future. In years to come, the Europe we live in will be in need of strong collective action to respond to the expectations of its citizens, who are today informed citizens, fully aware of how much depends on choices made by policy makers. Those expectations are confirmed by public opinion polls.</p>
      <p sl="en">Jacques Delors once said that the European single market is about competition that stimulates, about cooperation that makes us stronger and about solidarity that makes us united. European cohesion that makes the single market work is delivered by the European regional policy, which is today based exactly on this triple foundation: competitiveness, cooperation and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">For years, we have talked about the need to unlock, to mobilise, the development potential of all European regions and cities. Experience and logic clearly show that this mobilisation turns out to be most effective and efficient if pursued through the direct engagement of subnational levels of European governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European regional policy has already passed the subsidiarity test. Subsidiarity works for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2006 reform of cohesion policy has made it a modern place-based policy founded on a balance between equity and efficiency, between bottom-up and top-down approaches, between common strategic European objectives and local flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a need to move further on those issues, to continue the reform of policy governance, but certain principles should not be abandoned. The new treaty has cemented the new understanding of European subsidiarity already deeply rooted in the cohesion policy, that is, subsidiarity extended to local and regional levels of governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can do more on it, especially with regard to the local level. Those who suggest that cohesion policy can be limited to Brussels and national level either do not know the European reality, or do not understand that excluding local and regional Europe from the pursuit of common European objectives is economically at best unwise and politically dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cohesion is a notion that excludes exclusion. For political, economic, social and legitimacy reasons, cohesion policy must not be divisive: it should be a policy for all, as the internal market is, as the common currency is.</p>
      <p sl="en">All elements of this integration triangle – common market, common currency, cohesion – are mutually strengthening and interdependent. They are our common European public good.</p>
      <p sl="en">We policy makers have raised the stakes by promising to deliver. The challenges are well known; the EU 2020 strategy has been opened to public consultations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Development policy with clear targets and tools is needed. Cohesion policy is a policy for development that engages all levels of European governance working in concert for European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, Europe needs new energy to take care of its future, to renew itself in an assertive way. It is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come from. For me, the answer is clear. Today, this energy should come from below. Today this energy can be released through the direct engagement of local and regional levels of European governance in the pursuit of common European objectives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the questions put forward are very pertinent. They underline the importance you attach to cohesion policy as well as your dedication to keep the policy at the heart of European integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards your question on multi-level governance, multi-level governance has been recognised as a fundamental mechanism in delivering EU policy priorities. The growing interdependence between different levels of government in the Union was stressed by the consultation paper launched by the Commission on the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cohesion policy is a good example of multi-level governance. It offers a governance system which values and exploits local and regional knowledge, combines it with strategic direction from the Community level, and coordinates interventions between levels of government.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strengths of multi-level governance were also stressed by the Committee of the Regions in its White Paper of June 2009, where it called on the Union to strengthen mechanisms of multi-level governance and pointed to the leverage effects generated by cohesion policy, which contributed to the implementation of other Community policies as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">On your two questions concerning the eventual abandonment of Objective 2 and the eligibility of all European regions, in the period 2007-2013, all regions are eligible for structural funds support. Concerning the period post-2013, there is no official Commission position at this stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards your third question on the weakening of the principle of additionality, additionality is one of the basic principles of cohesion policy. It ensures that the structural funds do not replace the public or equivalent structural expenditure by a Member State. Thus, it guarantees the genuine economic impact of EU interventions and provides cohesion policy with an important European added value.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to your question on the regional dimension of cohesion policy after 2013, the Lisbon Treaty maintains the objective of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions as part of the Union’s remit on economic, social and territorial cohesion under Article 174.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, Article 176 points out that the European Regional Development Fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards your question on the involvement of regional and local levels of governance in the pursuit of European objectives within the framework of post-2013 cohesion policy, once again, I would like to draw your attention to the Commission’s consultation paper on the EU 2020 strategy, which looks for the active support of stakeholders, such as the social partners and civil society, and recognises that the take-up of the EU 2020 vision across all the regions of the EU will also be crucial to its success.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has not yet developed a position on what role cohesion policy will play in the delivery of the EU 2020 strategy. But the cohesion policy has the capacity to mobilise regional or local actors across all boundaries in pursuit of European objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to your question whether the Commission intends to publish a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, at the current stage, a separate White Paper on Territorial Cohesion is not foreseen. Policy conclusions resulting from the public debate on the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion will instead be incorporated in the comprehensive cohesion policy legislative package for post-2013 prepared in the context of the Fifth Cohesion Report which, according to the new treaty, is due for submission in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">On your question concerning the role of the European Social Fund in cohesion policy, in pursuing the objective of balanced and sustainable development, cohesion policy plays a crucial role in the delivery of European priorities. This is also the case for the European Social Fund, which will continue to pursue its objectives as defined by Title XI of the new treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion requires appropriate policies and a mix of investments from various levels. Human capital investments financed by the ESF form an essential component of this policy mix in the context of the global knowledge-based economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to your question on the role of cohesion policy in relation to other EU policies, cohesion policy provides the EU with its largest source of investment in the real economy. The December 2008 communication of the Commission on ‘Cohesion policy: investing in real economy’, underlined the importance of the policy for focusing on the EU Lisbon Agenda delivery, investing in people, business, research and innovation, priority infrastructures and energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s current focus is on ensuring that the implementation of the planned investments can be delivered in partnership with national and regional authorities as effectively as possible. This effort involves close cooperation between relevant Commission services and between the Commission and relevant regional and local authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">A practical example of cooperation between the Commission services is the ‘Practical Guide to EU funding opportunities for research and innovation’ published in 2007, which was conceived to help potential beneficiaries to find their way through the three funding Community instruments and provides policy makers with advice on coordinated access to those instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the ESF is concerned, the close alignment of its priorities with the Employment Guidelines provides for a direct link between EU employment policy priorities and EU financial support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Complementarity also exists between actions supported by the cohesion policy and by the rural development policy as clearly set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines of both policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that I have responded to some of your questions and I look forward to an interesting debate.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, today’s debate primarily concerns the substantive assessment of the cohesion policy and the way ahead for this policy. Of course, the European Parliament wants a financial mid-term review. The cohesion policy and the use of the funds now and in this subsequent period up to 2020 forms a key part of this. However, much to our surprise, we found absolutely no mention of a substantive assessment in the ‘non-paper’ preparatory to the mid-term review. I should like to make clear, as the first speaker from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), that the new Commission must present the European Parliament with a substantive assessment rather than a caricature of regional policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commission President Barroso’s vision document EU 2020 envisages growth and a knowledge-based economy, equipping and training, competition and a green economy. Well, then, regional policy now and in the future constitutes the European integration framework for the realisation of these objectives. Look at energy transition, climate change and the Lisbon Strategy: these are all essential elements for regions and cities.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As far as the PPE Group is concerned, we wish to focus the cohesion policy rather more on the key elements of this EU 2020 strategy, whilst retaining solidarity among all the regions and also Objective 2, about which the Commissioner spoke so vaguely just now. The promotion of competition in the rich regions forms part of the comprehensive assessment. Splitting budgets, increasing the sectoral fragmentation of funds at European level within the framework of such a mid-term review, serves no purpose whatsoever and is the wrong approach to take. In the present times of crisis, we are seeing how important regional funds are to recovery. These are being disbursed faster and are being fully utilised: in 2009, virtually 100% has been mobilised for innovation and new objectives in my region, the South Netherlands region. In early 2010, I myself shall be issuing a report on the synergy between regional funds and research and development.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to finish off with a question. Commissioner, you say you will not be presenting a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, yet it is Parliament that will be dealing with this by means of the ordinary legislative procedure and ensuring that these things are laid down in the new regulations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to see a more exciting introduction to this topic, because I believe that the European cohesion policy must change after 2013. We are faced with quite different challenges than was the case 10 or 15 years ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">The focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable. On the one hand, this means that all the regions must have the opportunity to participate in the European Union cohesion policy and, on the other hand, it also means that we must oppose any attempt to renationalise the cohesion policy. We need a European approach which allows citizens to identify with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, there is no question that we also need to change. In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy. In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money. We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation. Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need to concentrate on urban development. This is not because I want to neglect rural areas, but because we know that 80% of citizens live in towns, cities and urban hinterlands and because rural development unfortunately does not form part of the cohesion policy at the moment, but is covered by agriculture policy. Our approach is to create stronger networks. I do not yet know whether this will work, but we must rise to the challenge.</p>
      <p sl="de">Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner’s response was slightly evasive. For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly. Life-long learning is an important concept. However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy. There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Cross-border cooperation is very important to us. We want to strengthen this cooperation at the same time as simplifying the bureaucracy involved.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the reform of the Structural Funds is of fundamental importance in terms of the opportunity for the European Union to have financial instruments which are suitable for the economic situation, along with the relevant natural and human resources.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We are faced with a tough task in forecasting and devising a cohesion policy which will promote citizens’ long-term prosperity. This policy was and still is one of the visible quantifiable indicators of European solidarity. However, the disparities between some regions are fairly extreme and we must not ignore this fact.</p>
      <p sl="bg">What is alarming is that trends are being observed indicating that these disparities are growing, which may increase inequality and lead to isolation. As a representative of one of the poorest Member States in the European Union, I urge that one of the focuses of the cohesion policy will be cohesion between low-income Member States.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I note that we are not looking at the Structural Funds as a panacea. It is clear to us that we need to join efforts and increase our pace towards achieving the European Union’s basic standards. We should also warn of the possibility that the fact that countries are moving at different speeds may lead, at a suitable moment, to an internal restructuring of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Above all, we must set criteria, simplified terms and an equal chance of acquiring resources from the EU funds. Only after this should a clause be added for reducing the support for countries which fail to make any progress. I feel it is appropriate, if some countries encounter difficulties while acting on their own, to have them included in areas and problems with a significantly transnational dimension.</p>
      <p sl="bg">As a result, European resources will also be allocated to richer countries and their regions with a lower GDP. Ultimately, the results of the cohesion policy must also be measured in terms of employment generated. This is also an indicator of how it integrates with other policies and ensures added value.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, not much has been said about the significance of the European cohesion policy in Europe. It lies at the centre of the European Union, as it is the policy which holds the EU together at its heart. It is a symbol of solidarity and of overcoming national egoism. It is an instrument for all the regions. This is why the European Parliament is so concerned that this solidarity mechanism may simply be abolished behind our backs. It does not say much for good governance when the Commission secretly issues strategic documents, instead of holding an open debate about how we can continue with the solidarity mechanism in the light of the major challenges which face us, such as climate change and demographic change, given the tight budgetary constraints.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need reform, but it must result in genuine change. It must bring about sustainable development in the regions. It must provide the regions with support for their projects and not consist of top-down policy, in the way that this earmarking mechanism currently does. Instead, it must develop a bottom-up process in close partnership with all the players in the regions. We are familiar with this process. We already have the LEADER method for the development of rural areas. This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and getting everyone involved in order to ensure a very high level of local acceptance. However, we need a Commission which is brave enough to say yes to the solidarity mechanism and yes to the regions deciding on their own development, rather than this being the responsibility of national governments.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current cohesion policy is a living organism. As Europe changes, the position of individual states and groups changes in respect of this policy. Unfortunately, more questions than answers have emerged in discussions over the future of cohesion policy after 2014.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Will cohesion policy continue to serve mainly the least developed regions of the Union? Will we have the opportunity to construct transport and technical infrastructure in the coming period? Will we manage to improve quality of life and make savings? Will we manage to reduce the bureaucracy and excessive administration connected with the drawing of EU funding? We will be looking for consensual answers to these and other questions in the very near future.</p>
      <p sl="cs">From the perspective of future developments, I personally consider it vital firstly to align the role of local authorities correctly in managing European funds and secondly, to target European funds at supporting the use of modern technologies. It is precisely these two areas that are combined in the so-called Smart Cities initiative, which offers an opportunity to revitalise municipal authorities and, at the same time, to offer the business sector the opportunity in a period of economic crisis to apply modern systems and intelligent technologies and to generate economic growth. This is unquestionably a reason for focusing strategic investments on this area not only at a local authority level but also at a Member State and even EU level. Intelligent transport systems that can liberate cities from transport chaos, supportive navigation mechanisms that can increase the attractiveness of tourism in cities, and teleassistance systems enabling senior citizens to remain longer in their own homes are all types of investment that should be given the green light.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As a result of the economic crisis, our debate on the future of the cohesion policy has become even more urgent than it ever was in the past. Today, we must think twice before deciding where to direct European funds.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the European Union’s cohesion policy has not only failed to reduce regional and social inequalities, but it has also helped to exacerbate them. The values given in statistics are often fictitious, as the European Union itself admits, which is why it created the transitional support regime for a series of regions, three of which are in my country, Greece.</p>
      <p sl="el">The rule of unequal development in the capitalist system is implacable, especially in times of crisis, during which contrasts are even more marked. Unfortunately, forecasts for 2013 are even worse for the workers, especially in less developed areas. The European Union’s cohesion policy tries to gloss over this anti-grassroots policy, to buy people off, to disorientate the workers and, more importantly, to secure the profitability of capital.</p>
      <p sl="el">The aim of temporarily ironing out the contrasts between sections of the plutocracy, misleadingly referred to as ‘solidarity’, is now being replaced by the rule of competition and the free market. These elements also exist in the Lisbon Strategy and the EU strategy for 2020.</p>
      <p sl="el">It calls for new forms of regional and local governance, as proposed in Greece by the PASOK and New Democracy parties, extended and more direct intervention by the European Union in regional bodies and differentiated territorial cooperation which will also cross national borders. We call on the workers to reject this policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to take advantage of my speaking time to call on you, Mr President, to exert your influence in obtaining satisfaction in the European Parliament of the just demands of the workers, who are taking to the streets.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, regarding post-2013 cohesion policy, a leaked draft budgetary document entitled ‘A Reform Agenda for a Global Europe’ reveal that EU funding from 2013 onwards could change entirely to a nationally coordinated rather than regionally allocated distribution.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft abandons regional and local level control in multi-level governance, overturning the shared management principle. Instead, a sectoral approach to the new budget is adopted rather than operating independently within current structures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal to limit the policy to national level would lead to qualifying Member States governing redistribution. Not only does this mean that net contributors will lose further return funding, but those Member States expected to join the European Union under future expansion would enter membership under cohesion funding likely to remain for the forthcoming budgetary duration.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result, those countries who currently shoulder a large proportion of the Union’s financial burden, like the UK, will discover they must finance an ever-increasing pool of Member States qualifying for support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even fewer will have to carry even more, with a possible loss of the rebate for the UK. With more countries queuing up to join the EU, I am concerned Wales will see much needed support go to newer Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is no surprise that some of Europe’s richest countries like Norway and Switzerland have given the European Union a wide berth, knowing that they would be paying to fund their poorer neighbours. But Wales cannot afford to pay if nothing is paid back out.</p>
      <p sl="en">The move reinforces the European Union’s increasing ambition to become further integrated, centralised and federal, yet abandons the regional dimension of cohesion policy which underpins the European Union’s pledge to support territorial cohesion and deliver benefits to all members.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead the EU, like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, is covertly abandoning cooperation and compromise in favour of consolidation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whereas the people of Europe were told the Union – on the grounds that it enhanced trade links – strengthened agriculture ties and promoted equality, the machinations of an increasing bureaucratic global Europe see the focus on farming and regional development decrease in favour of an unwanted ambitious global strategy, including increased emigration to countries like the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">Larger shares of the EU budget will need to be devoted to such an agenda at the expense of regions such as Wales. The last payments to projects under the 2007-2013 EU structural funds programmes will be made in 2015. There is uncertainty over what, if any, subsequent EU funding will be available to Wales in future funding rounds.</p>
      <p sl="en">The implication that cohesion might disappear entirely from richer nations with no mention at all of transitional funding would further disenfranchise the people of the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">The disproportionate membership bill would be better steered towards funding economic development through self-sufficiency determined by the UK itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU budget review set to be published in the spring will likely see every government in Europe declare the necessity for increased public sector borrowing. It seems increasingly likely that the level of funding available to Wales will reduce substantially.</p>
      <p sl="en">The consequences will include reductions in programme budgets, less investment in the wider economy in Wales, and broad-reaching loss of jobs connected to programme management and project delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rather than having any sort of beneficial effect on my constituents, the EU will serve a glancing blow to the people of Wales if they decide to pull the rug from under our feet. The likely result of the reduction in funding to Wales and the UK will have a major impact on our country as a whole which will affect the farming sector as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">It now must be time that the people of Wales and the UK have a referendum on its relations with the European Union so the people can decide if they want to be governed by Westminster or Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us just imagine for a moment the European regions without the European regional policy. Many towns and rural regions would lack decisive incentives for structural change. The border regions with their problems of cross-border workers and cross-border infrastructure would simply be neglected. Social policy would no longer be able to benefit from European contributions to education and employment policy. Medium-sized companies would be prevented from taking part successfully in international networks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Without European regional policy, the communities in the regions would no longer be visible. For this reason, we are very annoyed by the signals coming from the Commission which include proposals for social programmes without the support of structural funding. This would turn the Commission into a social monopoly without the regions or would lead to calls for subsidy policy only for the weakest in our society. This, in turn, would mean that we would completely lose sight of the European context and we would return to the age of renationalisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether or not the Commission has now made these documents public, the European Parliament will not lend its support to the move that they describe to a regional policy without the regions. This does not mean that we are closed to the idea of reform. New challenges relating to the environment, to energy policy or to demographic change must be integrated into our existing subsidy structures. I am also in favour of making it easier to measure the European contribution to the regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must also impose stricter sanctions on the Member States which consistently fail to demonstrate that they are managing the funds properly. More regional cofinancing, more loans, more transparency and more efficiency: these are the types of proposals we would like to see for the reform of the cohesion policy. We will support proposals of this kind, but we will fight every attempt to destroy regional policy. Reforms yes, renationalisation no!</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I agree with the members who have spoken so far and I, too, should like to point out that we cannot accept a post-2013 cohesion policy which, firstly, will distinguish between the regions of the Europe with proposals such as abolishing Objective 2 (competitiveness); secondly, will include the renationalisation of policies; and, thirdly, will exclude local authorities from the programming and implementation of Community policies.</p>
      <p sl="el">On the contrary, we envision a post-2013 cohesion policy, a period in which there will still be a common European policy applied to all regions of the European Union, that will continue to have adequate funds to achieve its objective and will have simplified application rules so that it acquires even greater added value.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am concerned about the contents of the document for the 2020 strategy, because there is no reference to cohesion policy, which is the most appropriate tool for achieving the Lisbon objectives. In fact, a large part of cohesion policy is already serving these objectives and will prove its added value. Also, important proof of its significance is that cohesion policy has spearheaded the European Economic Recovery Plan.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is one development policy, one solidarity policy, one policy for every European citizen regardless of the region of the European Union where they are living. Unfortunately, however, in the European Commission, they forget this or they appear to ignore it and they process proposals that change the principles and form of cohesion policy. However, you can be sure that we shall take every opportunity to remind them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, funding for the regions and structural funding form part of our practical economic policy and make Europe widely visible. In local authority areas, towns and municipalities in the regions, different players are working closely together. For this reason, we must retain this integrated approach for the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy. We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises. In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised. These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as far as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is concerned, cohesion policy is at the heart of one of the most fundamental policies of the European Union: solidarity. Europe becomes stronger whenever European solidarity is shown. This is a fundamental issue for us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission must, in our view, integrate the following principles. Firstly, since territorial cohesion is a political priority, it should therefore also be a budgetary priority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the region is the appropriate level of partnership for a regional development policy. Renationalising this policy would be unacceptable for us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, cohesion must also be used to reduce the most serious economic and social disparities within a territory for the benefit of deprived urban areas or rural areas that are in difficulty or which receive very few services on account of structural handicaps, as is the case with islands, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the eligibility of all EU regions to benefit from cohesion policy must be judged on an individual basis, of course, according to their level of wealth, but the European Union must be able to make its contribution whenever cohesion policies are at stake.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union. The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission’s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised. The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say one last word about the border regions. As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there. I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, you will probably have heard in the meantime that there is serious consternation and disquiet among the members of the Committee on Regional Development, because a so-called secret document from the Commission has been circulating since October. This document contains the draft of a budget reform for the period 2013-2020 which represents a U-turn in budget policy. The original regional focus of the budget has been replaced by a sectoral approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new draft represents a huge restriction on the principles of subsidiarity and multi-level governance, which is in contradiction to the Lisbon strategy. In specific terms, the draft includes plans to abolish Objective 2, in other words, competitiveness and employment policy. As there are Objective 2 regions in every Member State, this would, of course, sadly affect two thirds of all the EU regions. This unfortunate proposal is justified on the basis that the difference between new – or in other words, future – Member States and Western Europe at a national level is so great that a new budget policy is needed. In the light of the financial crisis, this is said to be a way of stimulating the economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">It seems obvious to me that this proposal is anticipating the possible accession of Turkey. We know that increased funding would be needed and this is a way of planning to ensure that the huge amounts of money required for the accession will be available.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to say quite clearly that at a regional level, the success of the cohesion policy lies in its proximity to local economic problems. As a result, money will be invested sensibly and efficiently, as it has been until now. If the regional component is not included, it will not be possible to bring an end to the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group clearly supports a strong and well-financed cohesion policy that can promote the convergence of Europe’s regions. Indeed, we believe that, to be effective, this policy must be reformed and enhanced. We, Parliament and the European Commission, must design this policy together, with maximum transparency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the creation, by Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development, of a working group on the future of cohesion policy. Consultation on the post-2013 budget and the future objectives of this policy must involve all the actors concerned: the Member States, the regions, the European Commission and Parliament. It is inconceivable to weaken, or indeed abolish, the regional and local levels that give full meaning to this policy. Where financing in particular is concerned, we are today faced with great uncertainty regarding the future of this cohesion policy. The expiry date of the current financial framework is uncertain, as is the extent of the reform of the financial perspective. The importance of maintaining stability in the financing of this policy must be remembered. It is also crucial to reject any idea of renationalising cohesion policy, since this would deprive the regions of the choice of how to share out the Structural Funds and would destroy the regional dimension of this policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We expect an unmistakably proactive attitude from the Commission concerning the preparation of a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, Commissioner. With regard to the distribution of these funds, we do not want egalitarianism but financial equity, and we want this in conjunction with a form of harmonious development that is based on findings and on situations that vary according to territory. Cohesion policy must not just focus on the most impoverished regions; it must be aimed at all of Europe’s regions, including those overseas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is vitally important for Parliament to have clearly identified local contact points. That is the price – the only price – at which the European Structural Funds will be distributed fairly and effectively.</p>

      <p sl="es">We must defend cohesion policy as a Community policy that is a bulwark against attempts at renationalisation. This is necessary not only because of its direct impact on the development of cohesion across our regions and Member States, but also because of its added value in terms of strategic planning, financial stability and the visibility of the European project.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time, it is important to bear in mind the vital role the regions play and must play in cohesion policy. Decentralised management and good governance at various levels are crucial to ensuring the success of regional development policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need a debate on the Community budget and how to improve its sustainability and transparency in future. The post-2013 financial framework must be built on the basis of solidarity and territorial cohesion. These are crucial values for regions like Madeira, which face permanent difficulties and therefore require permanent support.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to share with you a few ideas that I think should always be present when we think about and develop our cohesion policy. On a number of occasions, the Commission has mentioned certain aspects that I believe are essential, such as the need for this policy to be more flexible, simpler, more efficient and more results-oriented in its definition and implementation. There are, however, issues that cause me some concern, particularly with regard to the needs of the outermost regions. I should like to make three brief remarks in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, the current regional approach should prevail over alternative criteria, such as added-value sectors. Such a change could jeopardise Objective 2, which currently benefits roughly two thirds of the European regions, as well as being potentially counterproductive in regions with highly specific economic profiles and competitive advantages.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, I believe it is vital to maintain the proximity criterion in the cohesion policy. Priority should still be given to allocating and managing the Structural Funds from a regional standpoint and not from a national or even a centralised European one.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For my third and final point, but one that is no less important, I should like to highlight Article 349 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which provides for special treatment for the outermost regions with regard to access to structural funds, precisely because of their economic and social situation compounded by permanent and unique constraints and characteristics, which reveal themselves in their constant difficulties and therefore require the permanent aid that is sought.</p>

Thanks to the policy, many new jobs have been created, and more will doubtless be created in the next few years. Investments related to environment protection are also extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When evaluating the policy and its effectiveness to date, it is worth answering a basic question: what will happen after 2013? The European Parliament should say clearly that there is no consensus on rationalisation of the cohesion policy. After 2013, as well as its traditional activities and mechanisms, the cohesion policy should support research, science, development, innovativeness, job creation and the fight with global warming. The cohesion policy should also include rural areas to a greater degree. It is important that realisation of the cohesion policy be based on regions and macroregions.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly about three matters: equality of rights and status, secrecy and, last but not least, the importance of rural development. Twenty years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and 20 years after our fellow Member, László Tőkés, broke through the wall of silence at the start of the Romanian revolution in Temesvár (Timişoara) in Transylvania, it has been said more than once that in the 21st century, we no longer have old and new Member States in the European Union, but a single European Union. I fully agree with this statement, which is, of course, very general, but I feel it is important that it does not only appear as part of token decisions, but also features in the everyday application of the cohesion policy, one of the European Union’s most important common policies.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If the European Union’s Member States enjoy equal rights and status, it is inconceivable that the cohesion policy should be reformed in such a way that the European Union Member States who joined in 2004 and 2007 lose out in the new cohesion policy. Such a reform is simply unimaginable. My second point is about secrecy. It is a ridiculous state of affairs where the European Commission either pronounces some meaningless statements on the cohesion policy’s future or says absolutely nothing at all on the subject. As an MEP and a member of the relevant European Parliament committee, I would expect the European Commission to adopt a clear, unambiguous position on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Last but not least, I want to talk about rural development. I firmly believe that rural development must continue to be a crucial aspect of the cohesion policy. Suitable resources need to be allocated to rural development policy. Based on the technical position adopted by the European Council of Municipalities and Regions, I think it is important for us to think through the possibility of integrating rural development policy with the cohesion policy after 2013.</p>

It contributes decisively to creating a European sense of belonging and is one of the most successful and effective European development policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, I cannot hide my concern at the Commission’s now famous ‘Non-Paper’ and its proposals. We do not accept the renationalisation of the cohesion policy, which would, in practice, come to an end if its effectiveness depended on each Member State’s wealth. I sincerely hope that the Commission will abandon that path once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As you are aware, Commissioner, the new Article 349 of the Treaty establishes the need for European policies to be adjusted to the special characteristics of the outermost regions, particularly to mitigate their handicaps, but also to make good use of their potential. What ideas can you give us on the future strategy for the outermost regions that the Commission is to publish during 2010?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like my colleagues, I, too, have been concerned by some of the trends outlined in the internal document which, in the grand old scheme of things, was leaked recently. The area that is causing me most concern is the suggestion to deprioritise the competitiveness objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">These competitiveness objectives have been vital in creating rural and regional development – particularly the technology parks, which have helped to drive the smart economy and will be needed more so into the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">They have also helped with cohesion within, as well as across, regions. I think it is very important to realise that there are huge poverty gaps within regions. This is not always recognised, and I think in particular the criterion of basing everything on national GDP is an erroneous measurement. It should be more on purchasing power, and certainly the purchasing power within some regions is far lower than the national average.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope these things will be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper, as well as the opportunities that exist in synergies between research, innovation and regional development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Like my colleague, I, too, would be concerned about rural development policy – albeit not as part of the cohesion policy, more in line with the CAP – but, at the same time, it is absolutely vital that it is not squeezed in any future proposals because rural development, and particularly the family farm, is vital for the social infrastructure of society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I just want to say also that more needs to be done in combating fraud. I know there have been improvements in recent years, but we must ensure that the money which is given by the EU goes to where it is supposed to go, so that we can have better opportunities for people right across the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Podkarpacie – the region I represent – is a region of wonderful, ambitious, hard-working people, a place where many energetic businesses operate. New initiatives are appearing, such as Aviation Valley, but at the same time, Podkarpacie is one of the most poorly developed areas in the European Union. Our problems are not the result of a lack of willingness, but of structural and infrastructural limitations, which, with the help of a variety of programmes, we are trying to eliminate. I would like to stress that, as part of our efforts, we are not asking for charity, but for support for our initiatives. We, too, want the competitiveness of the European economy to rise, and we want solutions which will help protect our climate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, we also want the change in priority of financing to be gradual, not sudden, because that would mean leaving the weakest regions to look after themselves. It is very important that the cohesion policy be realised by the regions, because such a solution brings the best effects. I would also like to note that the cohesion policy carries with it a very important message for the citizens. It shows that Europe is united and that it is worth participating in this exceptional project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the regional structural funding is an important tool for European integration and the Objective 2 funding in particular has, in the past, been seen as an engine for local structural and economic development by the people in many regions. It is an important means of managing structural change in the regions and in local authority areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">This allows citizens to experience Europe at first hand, because the funding has a local impact. However, we need simpler, clearer and more transparent structures and better controls in the cohesion funds, so that the money is used sustainably and efficiently. Cohesion, or the convergence of social and economic development, is a major objective of the EU and, therefore, it is important that this instrument is strengthened rather than weakened in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The cohesion policy in Europe needs more clarity, more transparency and more efficiency. The individual Member States must also take more responsibility in this area. This is why it is important to retain the system of additionality in funding. We do not want structural funding to be renationalised. Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission to meet these requirements in the funding criteria for 2013.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Wales is probably the most positively European area in the UK, and the reason for that is that every community, almost every individual and many organisations benefit from European funding, formerly Objective 1 and now convergence funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, if the proposals suggested by the Commission are brought forward, I believe it would have huge political consequences in areas like Wales. It would also, of course, have huge economic, financial and social consequences for those regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I think it is absolutely vital that all Members of this Parliament urge the Commission to bring forward proposals which are acceptable to us – and by that I mean proposals which would allow every region across Europe that qualifies, to access structural funds – and also to ensure that those areas ceasing to be eligible for convergence funding after 2013 also have some transitional status in the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have, in any case, listened very carefully to all of my fellow Members’ speeches. I think that two main points have come out of these speeches. The first is the secrecy surrounding the Commission’s mysterious ‘non-document’, and that is why we are eagerly awaiting the Commission’s explanations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second is this rather strange attitude whereby territorial cohesion policy is apparently being redefined on the basis of completely new priorities, which seem to have very little in common with cohesion itself. I am thinking in particular of the issue of foreign policy, which we are well aware is a priority for the High Representative, but which is obviously much less of a priority in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the common agricultural policy, unfortunately, it has already been sacrificed to a great extent to market forces. Therefore, we believe that it would be extremely helpful if the Commission could give us a much clearer idea of what its objectives are from now on.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the concerns of many of my fellow Members. I strongly believe that GDP returning to barely positive growth rates such as those forecast for 2010 will not mark the end of the economic crisis we are experiencing. We will only be able to consider it actually over when employment has returned to pre-crisis levels. The most optimistic estimates put this time at around 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, it is necessary to implement an investment policy and it is vital in strategic terms that Objective 2, or something similar, is maintained, since it represents an effective instrument for helping our regions overcome the crisis. Maintaining Objective 2 is in the interests of Italy and of many other European countries, since it fulfils an essential need: development of lagging regions and strengthening of the competitiveness of the most developed regions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, all or at least the majority of the speakers are talking about the European social model, but this is not reflected sufficiently in the EU budget or in the cohesion policy. Therefore, I would like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) which is separate from the European structural policy. More funding should be allocated to the ESF and it should become more flexible. It should also be possible to increase the funding available during the seven-year finance period.</p>
      <p sl="de">By separating the social fund from structural policy, it will be possible to make sufficient funding available to those regions which are not economically underdeveloped and have therefore largely been ignored by EU structural fund policy. The European Social Fund should therefore be used more effectively to combat problems on the labour market, such as high levels of unemployment, low employment rates for women, large numbers of early school leavers and low levels of further education.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I consider that our parliamentary committee took a very important decision for today’s debate, which is proving to be extremely interesting, with so many issues and very important dimensions being raised which relate not only to an effective post-2013 cohesion policy, but also to the character of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to point out that this debate, this concern, is being formulated at a very strange time for the European Union. On the one hand, we have a positive step towards integration with the Treaty of Lisbon and, on the other, we are still experiencing the consequences of an unprecedented international financial crisis in which we all understood how important the solidarity of the European Union is in supporting the internal market and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to ask the European Commission about two issues which are worrying the European Parliament, on which I share my fellow members’ concern. Firstly, is there any intention in your plans for innovative proposals, which we are happy to accept, of renationalising Community cohesion policy and, secondly, what is to happen with Objective 2, because this is actually what is needed for the competitiveness, not only of certain areas, but ultimately of the entire European market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that the job of Parliament and of the European Union is to establish the basic conditions to allow people from all the Member States to have the best possible quality of life in the regions in which they live. However, these conditions vary widely throughout Europe. This is why we need a strong and adequately funded cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must strongly reject any proposals that involve leaving our chosen path and we have heard today that some have been made. We do not need renationalisation. We need funding instruments for all the European regions, including those which are disadvantaged and those which already have high levels of development. We must not put at risk what has already been achieved.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I find this debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2013 particularly useful. Nowadays, especially during this crisis, the differences between the levels of development in Europe’s various regions are considerable and are continuing to grow.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Local regions in Europe need to continue with the cohesion policy in order to achieve the proposed objectives. The disparities between the different regions must be reduced at a faster pace, without delay. The involvement of the regional and local levels of governance must definitely grow, but without these regions necessarily feeling that they are gradually being forgotten and abandoned.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Many countries in the European Union base their development efforts and national economic policy on the cohesion policy objectives as well. My country, Romania, also thinks that it would be particularly useful to continue with the current cohesion policy after 2013 as well, combining efforts and national funds with those offered by the Structural Funds and finances at regional level.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I agree that regional policy is the lever for better cohesion and solidarity in the Community. The present international economic crisis has bared its teeth. It has caused numerous inequalities and pressures, especially among vulnerable groups. It has increased unemployment, inequalities and social upheaval at national and regional level.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, the present global economic crisis is also a challenge.

Surely, the most important objective of the policy is sustainable development in a variety of areas.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Cohesion policy must be the same for both urban and rural areas. Let us remember that the Union, after such a major enlargement, is greatly differentiated. Ensuring equal opportunities for development is an important task. Contemporary challenges, which we have to face up to at the same time, are the fight against the economic crisis, the unfavourable demographic trend and, finally, climate change. One thing is certain: there is a need to continue the cohesion policy and to adapt it to the present challenges.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, there is no doubt that the cohesion policy will be closely involved in the realisation of the EU 2020 Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU 2020 Strategy will respond to numerous global challenges, and the cohesion policy will be among the key and fundamental instruments at the disposal of the European Union and Member States to address these challenges. Therefore, concerns that cohesion policy will be detached from the implementation of EU overall strategy are unfounded.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the Commission does not have clear answers at this stage to many of the questions and issues raised by honourable Members, such as on geographical coverage, the coverage or existence of Objective 2 regions, the appropriate funding base, transitional arrangements, or the status of individual groups of regions.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is of paramount importance. Given that we are dealing with a horizontal policy which redistributes more than a third of the EU’s budget, the results from achieving the cohesion objectives have a crucial bearing on the continent’s future. Since its inception, the cohesion policy has achieved spectacular successes in the EU15. Unfortunately, more active intervention is required in the Member States which have recently joined and are affected by extreme poverty. In addition, the situation is made even more difficult by new, strong challenges, such as climate change, the declining population or the global economic recession. Consequently, we must deal in the future with the territorial differences in social and economic indicators within a more effective and flexible framework. Strong emphasis must also be focused on the development of the least developed areas, especially small regions falling behind the regional average and struggling with far more severe disadvantages than even other areas surrounding them. With this purpose in mind, it would be worth considering earmarking resources at EU level, aimed specifically at bringing LAU 1 (formerly NUTS 4) planning-statistical regions into line where the decision about the use of these resources can be made by the relevant small regions or their associations. Coordination with the EU’s other policies must also be improved. The barriers between the various funds must be eliminated so that the maximum possible allocation of resources can be achieved. The implementation rules must also be greatly simplified. Furthermore, priority must be given to investments relating to education, vocational training and sustainable employment, and to the implementation of comprehensive programmes tailored to the small regions’ individual needs.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Europe of the regions is a principle on which the EU has long agreed. The cohesion policy after 2013 must continue to make this vision a reality. One good approach is to make territorial cohesion the main objective. In this context, interregional cooperation plays an important role. In recent decades, the interregional approach has had some significant successes. The various EU projects in this area allow citizens to experience Europe directly and bring the freedom of action characteristic of European policy down to a regional level. However, there is still work to be done in the future. An interregional approach requires effective coordination to bring the different structures in the different countries into line. Other important cornerstones of regional policy in the years to come will be additionality in funding, cross-sectoral cooperation and conditionality. In order to ensure that the funding reaches the areas where it is needed, projects must have clear and specific objectives. In my opinion, careful long-term planning also brings added value and prevents funds from being wasted.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I fear the provisions put forward by the Commission – especially those concerning the ending of Objective 2 and abandonment of the regional aspect of cohesion policy in favour of a sectoral approach – may mean a return to the concept of a two-speed Europe and an increase in the distance, in terms of economy and civilisation, between the old and the new Europe. Such a model would be a departure from integration of the entire 27 and from the idea of solidarity enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon. That idea, surely, lies at the root of the entire cohesion policy, which is intended to bring about equalisation of opportunities and elimination of differences between regions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposal of the Commission concerning increasing the emphasis on research and the development of new technologies should be praised. This is the route which Europe needs. In choosing this, we must not, however, forget those regions and countries where bringing the standard of living up to the EU average is a fundamental matter. Please remember that between the richest and poorest areas of the EU there is a greater than 11 times difference in wealth. Eliminating these differences must continue to be the main principle of EU cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A new version of the document is currently being written. I hope that in the new version, the Commission will take account of the words which were said during today’s debate, and of what is being said in various parts of the European Union and at various levels: local governments, governments, associations and non-governmental organisations. Good regional policy can be achieved only with close cooperation from the regions.</p>

Therefore, it would be sensible to remove this urgent matter from the agenda this afternoon, because any further debate would only hinder the work which is being done through diplomatic channels. This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case, we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda, because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be. That was my first request, Mr President. The second request will follow immediately.</p>

      <p sl="es">In my capacity as leader of the Spanish Socialist delegation to the European Parliament, I should like to express my appreciation of the words spoken by the President of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supported by the President of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). I do so for two reasons. Firstly, because as I see it, this House is clearly demonstrating its solidarity with Mrs Haidar personally and with her cause in this dangerous situation resulting from a prolonged hunger strike.</p>
      <p sl="es">My second reason is that I believe the House is also adopting a positive stance in support of the intense multilateral diplomatic effort led by the government of the Kingdom of Spain. This is, after all, the government of the country on whose territory Mrs Haidar is currently to be found. It is also the government of the country in which the hunger strike is taking place that Mrs Haidar herself has stated will not end until she returns to a territory that is not under Spanish jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore support the current diplomatic effort, and believe that our best course of action would be to avoid a resolution that could compromise the success of any negotiations that might take place in the next few hours …</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the Council notes with satisfaction that Parliament has confirmed the agreement that we reached at the conciliation meeting on 18 November this year. In conjunction with the outcome of the second reading in the Council, we are happy that Parliament’s second reading can be deemed to represent a common text from the two parts of the budgetary authority in accordance with the new Article 314 of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Council accepts this common text and the President of the European Parliament can thus declare the budget finally approved. However, I would like to point out that once you, Mr President, have declared the budget finally approved, the Council believes that it should be signed by both parties since the new Treaty states that both the Council and Parliament are responsible for it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Council regrets the fact that this position has not been taken into account. Having said that, we are not questioning in any way whatsoever what has been agreed. Nonetheless, we hope that next year’s budgetary procedure will allow sufficient time to deal with these matters.</p>

      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Now I have to read out some very important points which are related to the extraordinary way in which we adopted the budget. It is very important because we have moved from the Treaty of Nice to the Treaty of Lisbon. It was a very difficult move. We began under the Treaty of Nice, and we are ending under the Treaty of Lisbon, and this is why this statement is necessary. You have to listen to this statement.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">‘The budgetary procedure for 2010 has been exceptional. It started under Article 272 of the EC Treaty, but its last stage was conducted when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force. On 18 November 2009, Parliament, Council and the Commission therefore agreed to continue the budgetary procedure under the EC Treaty, but also reached an agreement covering the outcome of the budgetary procedure, including Parliament’s vote, which took place in full respect of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The President of the Council has just confirmed the agreement of the Council on the budget we have just voted. This means that Parliament and Council have now reached an agreement on a joint text, respecting the aim and purpose of Article 314. I thus note that the budgetary procedure, that was initiated under Article 272 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and continued under Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, has been completed in accordance with Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Multiannual Financial Framework. The budgetary procedure can thus be deemed to be completed and the budget is declared definitively adopted.’</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This is a very important statement. Next time, there will not be such complications, because the Treaty of Lisbon will be in force. Now I will officially sign the document.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to add that the Chair of the Committee on Budgets is Mr Lamassoure, who has put a great deal of work into this. I would also like to mention his name as someone who has been very active in this matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to look at the procedural argument. I would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the Cashman report. This is a report created by Parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure. Our Legal Service has stated that this is not permitted, but the socialists insisted on introducing it. While we were discussing the freedom of the press in Italy and the Commissioner responsible explained that the European Union has no authority in this area, the socialists still felt that it was worthwhile to attack Berlusconi. Whenever it suits the socialists, it is a question of there being no authority. Whenever other people are being opposed, the authority is in place. For this reason, we should not give in to them.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the second argument is worthy of serious discussion. Are we responsible for the Convention on Human Rights?

This means that if it is legitimate for the Italian Parliament to discuss this, because Italy is party to the Convention on Human Rights, then it is also legitimate for the European Parliament to discuss this, as it will be party to the Convention on Human Rights in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third and final argument concerns the fact that we are not lawyers, we are politicians. This judgment affects millions of people and, therefore, we should vote on it today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is horrific. Tens of thousands of people are killed in the country every month because of violence from the armed groups. The Congolese armed forces are often at the centre of such crimes, using unrestrained force at times, and civilians are usually the victims of such violence. The situation of women is appalling, with sexual violence a specific problem in the country. There are reported rapes by almost all fighting parties, including the Congolese army.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the EU’s engagement in Congo. European military engagement contributed to the prevention of a situation similar to the one in Rwanda. The EU police mission is especially important, since the main problem Congo faces is impunity and lack of criminal-prosecution capacity.

That is why more action needs to be conducted through the MONUC and more resources have to be given to the United Nations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">That created additional pressure on subheading 1a, considerably affecting the dynamics of the negotiations on the 2010 budget and jeopardising Parliament’s political priorities. Nonetheless, promises once made have to be kept, as in the case of the protocol concerning the conditions for the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, which contains the EU’s commitment to finance the decommissioning of Kozloduy. The additional financing needs in 2011-2013, totalling EUR 225 million, must be addressed in a mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework. Further financing of Kozloduy in 2011-2013 should be without prejudice to the financing of existing multiannual programmes and actions. I therefore voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), to which the sum of EUR 5 billion was allocated by Parliament in March 2009, is divided into trans-European energy projects and projects to develop broadband Internet in rural areas. This is an important instrument for tackling the economic crisis, reviving the economy and hence creating jobs. During the conciliation meeting of 18 November, an agreement was reached by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on financing for the second year (2010) of the EERP, to the sum of EUR 2.4 billion. This financing, for energy and broadband Internet projects, requires a review of the multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013.</p>

I would point out that my French socialist colleagues and I voted against the financial perspective for 2007-2013 as far back as 2006. Back then, we criticised a cut-price budget which, because of its shortcomings, would not have enabled far-reaching innovative projects to be developed. Today, our analysis is being confirmed: this budget does not put us in a position to tackle the crisis, and it reflects the absence of a European political project. Although the unprecedented economic crisis that Europe is going through requires a strong, common response from the Union, the Council and the European Commission have chosen to allow the Member States to develop their own recovery plans.

I welcome the allocation of EUR 300 million, although only EUR 280 million had been allocated initially, as immediate aid intended for dairy producers who are facing a collapse in prices, leading to insecurity.

Unfortunately, the negotiations on the financing of a European programme to promote micro-credit – a particularly useful and necessary instrument for reviving growth – are being held up at the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Similarly, the Council’s rejection of Parliament’s amendment proposing to increase the aid granted to people most in need, at a time of unprecedented economic and social crisis, is highly regrettable, when 2010 has been declared the ‘European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, the European Council’s announcement, last Friday, of the willingness of the EU and its Member States to contribute to the financing and prompt implementation of EUR 2.4 billion per year from 2010 to 2012 to help developing countries combat climate change is along the right lines.

      <p sl="pt">I regret, however, that only EUR 300 million, which I regard as too little, has been allocated for the creation of a fund for the dairy farming sector. The serious crisis that the sector is currently experiencing would justify the allocation of more funds to help producers overcome the difficulties they are currently facing.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This is a budget that will help to fight unemployment and kick-start the economy. Parliament is prioritising the European Economic Recovery Plan, with financing of EUR 2.4 billion for the coming year. I welcome the granting of EUR 300 million of additional support to the dairy sector, but I advocate creating a budget heading to establish a permanent fund for this sector. I also consider it very important that the current multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 be revised and extended to the 2015-2016 financial years, as we proposed in this budget. I would point out that the fight against climate change is an EU priority that is not sufficiently addressed in this budget. I would also point out that energy security is crucial for the Union, and I therefore welcome the signing of the Nabucco project. The budgets for Parliament and the other institutions, which have been tabled for second reading, are the same as we approved at first reading. Under heading 5, we have a margin of EUR 72 million, which will be used preferentially for financing additional expenditure directly attributable to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. I therefore voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We voted against this report, which ‘welcomes the overall agreement on Budget 2010’, because this is a Community budget that already reflects the priorities set in the Treaty of Lisbon for a European Union that is increasingly neoliberal and militaristic and less and less concerned with economic and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the midst of an economic and social crisis that is having terrible effects on employment and people’s living conditions, it is unacceptable for the Community draft budget to have EUR 11 billion less in payments than was projected in the financial perspective.</p>

      <p sl="pt">the creation of a budget heading for actions in the textile and footwear industry, with a view to creating a Community programme for the industry;</p>
      <p sl="pt">the creation of another heading to promote the transformation of jobs with no stability into jobs with rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The aims of these proposals are firstly to draw attention to the severe crisis that the textile industry is currently undergoing, which was partly caused by the exponential rise in imports from third countries, and secondly to help fight the rapid growth in job instability, unemployment and poverty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, as a result of the conciliation procedure, a level of expenditure was agreed which was satisfactory for Parliament and sufficient for realisation of the most important objectives of the Union next year. Especially significant are the agreements concerning means for realisation of the European Economic Recovery Plan, including projects in the field of energy, for which EUR 1 980 million has been reserved. A sum of EUR 420 million will be allocated to increasing the availability of broadband Internet, which will contribute to realisation of the principles of the Lisbon Strategy. Significant last-minute changes were made to planned administrative expenditures in connection with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Establishment of the European Council as an EU institution, as well as establishment of the office of President of the European Council and the External Action Service, entail consequences for the Union budget. Costs related to the European Council and the President are estimated at EUR 23.5 million and will be met with savings from 2009, whereas costs associated with establishment of the External Action Service may exceed even the EUR 72 million which is currently in the budget reserve for 2010. So the debate on expenditure in 2010 will not end today. The funds in the reserve may turn out to be insufficient, and then it will be essential to make a correction to the budget. It is necessary, therefore, to appeal to the Member States to show responsibility and make available the means needed for the Union to meet the new obligations which result from the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

Although it has been a fairly difficult task for us to find the necessary resources both for tackling the problems triggered by the crisis and for continuing the development projects which the European Union already has, I think that the budget extensively covers both situations. For example, the commitments made by the President of the European Commission at the end of 2008 were retained and innovative measures were also introduced, such as the Preparatory Action – Erasmus for young entrepreneurs. This budget will enable Romania to continue to enjoy financial support provided from the Structural and Cohesion Funds. In addition, good prospects are being created for dealing with the matter of the borders in the eastern part of the European Union, as well as for the Black Sea Basin area, given that resources have been allocated for preparatory action aimed at environmental monitoring of the Black Sea Basin and for a common European framework programme for developing this region.

The EU continues indiscriminately to apply neoliberal dogmas without giving due regard to the evidence of their economic ineffectiveness and environmental and social harmfulness.</p>

The sum of EUR 300 million has also been approved for the textile sector, something that Parliament had been demanding for a long time. The budget also includes several lines of support aimed at evaluating the status of key sectors of the economy, such as the textile and footwear industry and the fisheries sector, to promote renewal of the fishing fleet, which are very important sectors for my country. The pilot projects to halt desertification and to preserve jobs are also extremely relevant in these times of economic crisis.

In difficult economic times, measures are, of course, needed to stimulate the economy, but it is doubtful whether instruments such as the European Economic Recovery Plan can achieve this. In the past, much-vaunted EU programmes have turned out to be paper tigers. In addition, various EU subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds. This means that hard-earned taxpayers’ money has, for years, been trickling away into mysterious channels.

The European Parliament has also managed to top up the sums allocated for transport safety, the SESAR Joint Undertaking, activities for supporting European policies in the areas of transport and passenger rights, the Intelligent Energy Europe programme, which is part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking.

The right of citizens to access European institutional documents, in any form, is now enshrined in Article 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

      <p sl="fr">It is the duty of all European institutions – national and Community institutions alike – to represent European citizens in their entirety, without distinction.

      <p sl="pt">Belarus has deservedly been given the unflattering sobriquet of the last Soviet republic in Europe. Despite the progress that has been made in some aspects of that country’s political, social and economic life, it is clear that none of the reforms implemented there can yet justify rejecting that deplorable description.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In Belarus, elections are not free, there is no freedom of expression, association or demonstration, and repression by the authorities is increasing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union is in danger of being inclined to follow a line of appeasement with this dictatorship, as it did with Cuba. I think it will be wrong if it does so and does not make it clear that the values of democracy and freedom are not only non-negotiable but also inseparable from any agreements to be made with Belarus. The European Union must therefore maintain and strengthen its contacts with the democratic opposition in Belarus to keep faith with those to whom Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for their fight to democratise that country.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union cannot be an area concerned solely with the affairs of the countries that it comprises. It must also be a driving force for the democratisation of the countries that have emerged since the dismembering of the former Soviet Union. Any measures aimed at improving conditions in these countries are very important. That is the context for the spirit of this motion for a resolution, which calls for measures to be adopted to support Belarus, which must be accompanied by clear signs of democratic reforms by that country, as well as respect for human rights and the rule of law. The participation of Belarus in the Eastern Partnership is an important step in that direction, yet there are still many aspects to improve with regard to freedoms and safeguards within Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="de">I have voted in favour of the joint resolution on Belarus, because it gives a balanced presentation of the situation and highlights both the positive aspects and progress made and the democratic deficit in many areas.

      <p sl="pl">The resolution on Belarus is an important signal from the European Union and from Europe. We should show both the democratic opposition and the Belarusian authorities, and not only by such resolutions, that we do not agree with the violations of human rights or the ban on registration of political parties, non-governmental organisations and independent media.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament cannot agree with the use of capital punishment, and Belarus is the only country in Europe which applies this kind of penalty. We cannot ease sanctions against Belarus if there is no noticeable progress in the direction of democratisation of the country. The European Union must not close its eyes to the flagrant restrictions on freedom of speech, respect for human and civil rights and non-governmental organisations. The European Parliament, which is composed of Members from 27 Member States, is an expression of democracy and cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The only measures which we can and will support are democratic measures, because they are the foundation of the European Union. There can be no consent, on our part, to other measures. I hope the resolution on Belarus is one of many steps we will take. Belarusians, and also the whole of Europe, expect this of us.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for the resolution on Belarus with some doubt, because in the European Parliament, documents on Belarus are adopted too often and are thus devalued. On the other hand, while maintaining a critical tone towards the Minsk regime, this resolution accentuates more clearly than previous ones certain positive changes in EU-Belarus relations. In order for there to be a fundamental improvement in relations between the European Union, its Member States and Belarus, Belarus must steer towards reforms and democratisation. Such a turn would ease the development of all sorts of ties with this state. In Lithuania, 39 towns and regions are cooperating productively with Belarusian towns and regions, exchanging experience and participating in joint projects. I also approved of this resolution because it calls on the EU to devote more attention to concrete projects that coincide with the interests of the partner countries. In the resolution, we congratulated Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania, which became the first states to submit trilateral projects to the European Commission and EU Member States for the Eastern Partnership Programme. This is a list of concrete projects in the areas of border control, transport, transit, cultural and historical heritage and social and energy security.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I welcome the vote on this resolution. Today, despite the Goma Conference on peace, stability and development and the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement in January 2008, violent fighting continues to take place in the east of the DRC, leading to the worst possible atrocities being committed against the civilian populations, in particular, women, children and the elderly. This sexual violence is becoming widespread and is today being perpetrated not only by the warring parties but also by civilians. Everything must urgently be done to ensure the protection of the populations at a time when the number of MONUC soldiers present on the ground means that it is not always possible to curb this increase in violence. The Congolese authorities have recently shown their determination to put a stop to impunity. However, this zero tolerance policy must not only be ambitious – every single perpetrator of the atrocities, without exception, will have to answer for his actions – but must also be applied in practice. We have a duty, as MEPs, to point out the need to respect these international obligations, such as human rights and gender equality, so that the dignity of women and the innocence of countless Congolese children are preserved.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Ever since the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko’s kleptocratic regime, the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Belgian Congo and formerly Zaire) has been mired in agitation and the most brutal violence, which has already led to millions of deaths.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The east of the country has suffered particularly badly from this scourge, which knows no borders and has taken on much more of an ethnic than a national profile. The worst atrocities are repeated at such a rate that it is impossible to keep up with them, and the international community, particularly the UN forces, have not shown the ability to deal with them, despite all the civilian and military efforts that have been made so far.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That some African countries appear to be ungovernable and central governments have lost control of parts of their territories are, unfortunately, phenomena that have yet to be eradicated. They are often connected with the illegal exploitation and plundering of raw materials either by insurgent forces or by regular troops and their leaders. Even if these phenomena have their origins in the European decolonisation process and the way the borders were drawn, that cannot release African leaders and decision makers from their responsibilities or from calling on civil society in those countries to take decisive control of their own destinies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the resolution denouncing the serious ethnic violence that Congo has experienced recently and which has led to the displacement of almost 44 000 abandoned and totally destitute people. I am particularly concerned about the issue of sexual violence, which is being used as a weapon of war. This is an unacceptable crime, which must not go unpunished and which the European Union must take a stand against. We must ensure that those within the Congolese army who are responsible for these human rights violations are actually brought to justice.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union cannot remain aloof from the various armed conflicts that occur to some extent throughout the world. The violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a conflict that has been dragging on for many years, causing millions of people to die, to be displaced or to lose their homes. It is therefore very important to urge all parties in this conflict to cease hostilities so that the people of those regions can once again live in a climate of peace. It is vital that we continue to support the United Nations missions on the ground so as to ease the suffering of the whole population, especially the elderly, women and children.</p>

      <p sl="es">The armed conflict in the area can only be resolved by way of a political solution. All intervention by neighbouring and other countries must therefore cease. A diplomatic solution negotiated between the parties is required to bring the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to an end. Such a solution must comply fully with the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">The United Nations Security Council should review the mandate of MONUC. The mandate under Chapter VII should be done away with, to avoid strengthening the Congolese Armed Forces, thus endangering the United Nations peacekeeping mission. We call for the EUPOL and EUSEC missions to the DRC to be closed down. These missions have made a negative contribution to the escalation of violence and to the deteriorating situation in the country because they have trained security forces that have gone on to commit crimes against their own civilian population.</p>
      <p sl="es">United Nations resolutions concerning an embargo on the supply of arms to the DRC must be implemented. We wish to report that several Member States of the European Union are violating that embargo. The joint resolution tabled by the other political groups does not refer to these fundamental points, and I have therefore voted against it.</p>

Despite the large amounts of human resources and funding provided by the international community, it has not yet been possible to bring peace and stability to the area. On the contrary, the UN soldiers are being accused of taking sides and of helping to escalate the situation further. It is important that this issue is resolved.</p>
      <p sl="de">The huge cost of over EUR 7 billion for the UN mission, including humanitarian aid, can only be justified if it is clear exactly how the funds were used. As the resolution does not specifically call for this to be clarified, I have abstained.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The massacres, crimes against humanity, recruitment of child soldiers and acts of sexual violence against women and girls that are still taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo cannot leave us unmoved. Further efforts are needed to put an end to the activities of foreign armed groups in the east of the DRC. The international community cannot look on helplessly. It must ensure that the March 2009 agreements on the ceasefire are respected effectively and in good faith. Two recent reports of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights show that the humanitarian situation is worsening considerably.</p>
      <p sl="nl">MONUC plays a vital role, but its mandate and rules of engagement must be implemented with determination and on a permanent basis in order to guarantee the population’s security more effectively. MONUC’s presence remains necessary. Every effort must be made to allow it to carry out its mandate in full in order to protect those under threat. The Council must play a leading role and ensure that the United Nations Security Council supports MONUC by reinforcing its operational capacities and providing a better definition of its priorities, of which there are currently 41.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I crave the House’s indulgence, if we can move away from points of order and to the issue of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is currently a bill before the Ugandan Parliament, and some argue: what is it to do with us? Breaches of international obligations, the Cotonou agreement and breaches of human rights – as we have always shown – have everything to do with us.</p>
      <p sl="en">This bill’s provisions are draconian and among them, let me inform the House, are: any person alleged to be homosexual would be at risk of life imprisonment or in some circumstances the death penalty; any parent who does not denounce their lesbian daughter or gay son to the authorities would face fines and probably three years in prison; any teacher who does not report a lesbian or gay pupil to the authorities within 24 hours would face the same penalties; any landlord or landlady who happens to give housing to a ‘suspected’ homosexual would risk seven years of imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, the bill threatens to punish or ruin the reputation of anyone who works with a gay or lesbian population, such as medical doctors working on AIDS and HIV, civil society leaders active in the fields of sexual and reproductive health, hence, further undermining public health efforts to counter the spread of HIV.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is vital that this afternoon in this House we put aside our prejudices and we defend those who have no one left to defend them. Therefore, I warmly welcome the statement by the Commissioner on Development and Humanitarian Aid, Commissioner De Gucht, statements from the British, French and Swedish Governments as well as President Obama and the Chair and Vice-Chair of the US House of Representatives’ Committee on Foreign Affairs. I urge the House to give this the high importance which it deserves and to speak out for those in Uganda who currently are not being heard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last September, a member of the Ugandan Parliament introduced an ‘anti-homosexuality bill’. This bill would criminalise homosexuality, leading to punishment by imprisonment and even the death penalty. This would not only apply to these alleged criminals but also to those who failed to report these so-called crimes, or who support human rights and other work in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our concern is that this would violate freedom of sexual orientation as well as freedom of expression, which are human rights: they are not just European values but universal values.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also reject the death penalty as a whole and want to join the international community in its concern for NGOs which may have to cancel their activities working in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore join President Obama and others in the international community who have called for this bill not to be approved and for the review of any laws that would criminalise homosexuality in Uganda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Uganda is a deeply Christian country where traditional values hold sway. Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda as it is in many African countries. We must, of course, be sensitive about forcing our more liberal and tolerant values on others, because it can sometimes be counterproductive.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we should not be afraid to speak out against this outrageous bill, because it is clearly a draconian and hugely disproportionate piece of legislation. It would not only be seriously detrimental to the safety and freedom of homosexuals in Uganda, but it would also tarnish the image of Uganda throughout the world and make it into a pariah.</p>
      <p sl="en">Uganda has made many great strides in the past two decades and, in some ways, can be seen as a model for Africa’s development. Why should Uganda’s parliamentarians choose to throw all that goodwill away? Why should they seek to place their country alongside brutal Iran, which regularly executes homosexuals in public?</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us hope that, through our mutual outrage – in this House and in many other parliaments throughout the world – at this piece of brutal legislation, we can convince the Ugandan President to veto it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, some of the previous speakers have given details of this legislation which is now before the Ugandan Parliament. I would like to tell you a brief story. Around four to five years ago, I was in Kampala and one evening I met a group of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in a pizza restaurant, where the owner allowed the meeting to take place. On the same evening, a government minister said that raids would, in future, take place on any places where lesbians, gay men and transgender people met. I was rather worried that evening, as were the Ugandan lesbians and gay men. Luckily nothing happened, but it marked the beginning of increasing homophobia in Uganda. Now proposed legislation has been introduced which will not only make homosexuality a crime, as is already the case, but will also make it subject to the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="de">So many African Heads of State, including Museveni, have done a lot for their countries, but to say on this basis that homosexuality is un-African is simply wrong. Homosexuality has existed in all cultures on all continents throughout all periods of history and it will continue to exist, regardless of what legislation is passed. I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a joint resolution supported by almost all the groups, because it is important to express our opposition to the legislation and to support lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda. We must not allow them to be subjected to hate laws and stand by and say nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the European Union have an obligation to uphold human rights all over the world and to remind the members of the Ugandan Parliament that the Cotonou Agreement, for example, states that human dignity and human rights apply to everyone and must be defended by everyone. I also hope that the resolution that we have presented will be adopted in its entirety, because it is important for organisations which defend the rights of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda to be supported, including by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to answer the question, ‘Why should the European Parliament concern itself with this issue?’, I would say that the anti-homosexual legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament shows complete disregard for fundamental freedoms and absolutely must not be adopted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Ugandan legislation in force already criminalises homosexuality. For years, NGOs have been sounding the alarm about the violence committed against these groups. The fact is, if the new law is adopted in January 2010, it will exacerbate the situation and make homosexual acts punishable by life imprisonment or by the death penalty for homosexuals who are HIV positive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This law would also be a major obstacle to the fight against AIDS. There are other laws against homosexuals in Africa. However, this one is exceptional because, as Mr Cashman was saying, it forces citizens to report homosexual acts within 24 hours. If you are the doctor, parent or teacher of a homosexual, you have to report him or her to the police, or face a prison term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, this bill criminalises the legitimate work of non-governmental organisations, international donors and humanitarian associations which strive to defend and promote human rights in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As soon as it was presented to the government in Kampala, this bill was strongly condemned by human rights defenders throughout the world, by several states, including France, the United States …</p>
      <a text="(The President interrupted the speaker)"/>
      <p sl="fr">and by the European Commissioner for Development, Mr De Gucht. Uganda must respect its obligations in accordance with international humanitarian law and with the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Should the situation continue, the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, make representations to the Ugandan authorities and rethink its involvement with Uganda.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, some people think we should not get involved with this, because defence of the rights of homosexuals is an unjustified extension of human rights. This is a misunderstanding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognised that human rights include every person and no one must be excluded. A ban on discrimination because of sexual orientation is nothing new. The problem is that not everyone wants to recognise this kind of discrimination as a violation of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Uganda and some other African countries, there are voices saying that our interest in this subject is an expression of neo-colonialism, or that we are interfering in matters which are none of our concern. This, too, is a misunderstanding. For we are talking about general, universal rights. This is not just a whim. We respect the independence of Uganda and other states, but we cannot remain silent, when, instead of restricting discrimination, an attempt is being made to extend it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have an opportunity today to talk about the anti-homosexual draft legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament on 25 September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when we are seeing an increasing number of human rights violations, I feel it is crucial, in the light of this anti-freedom law, for the European Parliament to look beyond the divisions that separate its political families and be able to condemn this bill in the strongest possible terms and to call on the Ugandan Parliament to reject the bill and to review its national legislation in order to decriminalise homosexuality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Cashman pointed out just now, every single NGO has spoken out against this bill, regarding it, moreover, as a serious obstacle to the fight against AIDS. The Commission, through Commissioner De Gucht, and a large majority of the Member States – adding their voice to the statements made by President Obama – have already condemned this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on the Commission to rethink our involvement with Uganda if this bill is adopted. A country that, at that point, would be in violation not only of international law but also of the fundamental principles of the Cotonou agreements could not continue to benefit from the support of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that everyone must have the right to freedom of sexual orientation, without fear of imprisonment or death. This principle is not open to debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would have liked to start this debate by talking about the case of Aminatou Haidar. However, due to the reasons we already know, I cannot. In any case, the question of the eligibility rights in Uganda also deserves our attention, and this reminds us that once again, we are forced to adopt a new text condemning homophobia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the past, we have adopted several resolutions on that problem, including protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies. Today, we need to add the new text to those already adopted. The only attempt by a Ugandan MP to table the anti-homosexuality bill deserves a political response.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposed law includes provisions to punish those alleged to be lesbian, gay or bisexual with life imprisonment and even the death penalty. The draft also includes a provision that could lead to the imprisonment for up to three years of anyone, including heterosexual people, who fail to report within 24 hours the identities of everyone they know who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or who supports human rights for people who are. That means that any of us would also be susceptible to be taken to court for these reasons as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to remind the European Union and the international organisation that sexual orientation is a matter falling within the remit of the individual right to privacy guaranteed by international human rights law, according to which equality and non-discrimination should be promoted, whilst freedom of expression should be guaranteed. We ask international donors, both governmental and non-governmental, to cease their activities in certain fields should the bill pass.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strongly reject any move to introduce the use of the death penalty. If those requests are not met by the Ugandan authorities, then we should call on the Council and Commission to reconsider their engagement with Uganda, should the bill pass into law and breaches of international human rights law take place. For that reason, I wish to remind the Ugandan Government of its obligations under international law and under the Cotonou Agreement, which call for universal rights to be respected.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europe must intervene on this matter with all the tools it has available, particularly within the scope of the Cotonou Agreement. We must demand the immediate withdrawal of this draconian bill; otherwise there will be consequences for economic and political cooperation with Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When I learnt about the content of this proposed legislation and when I heard reports about the sad fate of homosexuals in Uganda, Sudan, Iran and Nigeria, to mention just a few examples, I realised how deplorably deep-rooted homophobia still is in many cultures, in blatant violation of those countries’ human rights obligations. The role played by far-right evangelical Christians in the United States in mobilising and financing several initiatives of this kind in Africa is shocking.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Europe and its institutions must do all they can on the ground in the countries in question to neutralise and fight the evil, obscurantist influence of these agents of intolerance, who are instigating a new wave of hate crimes in Africa.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, concerning the Ugandan bill which has provoked such indignation amongst us, I very much welcome the fact that the Members of the different parliamentary groups in the House who have taken the floor on this subject have spoken with one voice. I believe this is indicative of unanimity across the Chamber. I have asked for the floor simply to add my voice to theirs before voting accordingly later.</p>
      <p sl="es">I support Mr Cashman, the authors and group spokespersons. My reasons are that the fight against intolerance, discrimination and, in this case, also homophobia and the death penalty, requires us to be very firm and call upon the Commission and the Council to be firm too. We must persevere until we succeed in bringing about the withdrawal of this iniquitous bill. Taking the bill forward would be tantamount to returning Uganda to colonial conditions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I, too, wish to say that I am appalled by the way in which the law we are discussing is presented. It goes without saying that we cannot accept in Europe sanctions being imposed against a person for their sexual orientation and for failing to provide information about a person’s sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also like to stress that the discussion we are having is taking place in the context where the second review of the Cotonou Agreement is being discussed. Uganda is a party to this, and this agreement very clearly sets out the need to respect human rights. I also voted on Monday this week, as part of the Committee on Development, for a report by Mrs Jolie on this topic of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that today’s discussion, although it could have taken place earlier last month, puts us in this position where we obviously cannot but reject what is happening in Uganda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned over the draft anti-homosexuality bill introduced recently in the Ugandan Parliament. The bill, if adopted, raises serious human rights issues which are of great importance to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers that the penalisation of homosexuality, as foreseen in the bill, would go against the UN human rights conventions. Uganda has ratified these conventions. Thereby it has the legal obligation to respect them, without distinction or discrimination. Domestic legislation must be consistent with international human rights obligations. The bill would also go against the EU-supported UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity of 18 December 2008 regarding the decriminalisation of homosexuality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner De Gucht personally raised these concerns in a letter to President Museveni last November. He emphasised that respect for human rights is of the greatest importance to the Commission and to the European Parliament. However, he expressed his confidence to the President that, under his guidance, such retrogressive legislation will not be allowed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency and the Heads of Mission in Uganda also raised this issue with the Ugandan Government on several occasions, during meetings with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice, in Article 8 meetings, and with the Uganda Human Rights Commission. In its latest démarche on 3 December, the EU Presidency and the local troika met the acting Foreign Minister, to whom they again expressed these serious concerns, confirmed their support for fundamental freedoms and reminded Uganda of its international obligations. The Minister, while mentioning traditional values and cultural traditions that take time to change and alleging evidence of orchestrated campaigns to take advantage of poor people and recruit them into homosexuality, took note of the EU positions and committed himself to reporting them personally to the Cabinet and to Parliament in order to enable them to take an informed decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission hopes that, in the vein and in the spirit of the ongoing EU-Uganda partnership, these démarches, together with those of others, will lead to a review of the proposed legislation to make it compatible with international principles of non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has embarked on an interesting Eastern Partnership project, which has met with support and encouraging collaboration from six countries: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="it">This operation is improving the relationship between the European Union and these countries and may lead to democratic and economic development of the area, albeit to a varying extent depending on the history of each country. Given this intelligent political strategy, in my view, it is inappropriate to hold this urgent debate on two young bloggers sentenced following events for which proceedings are still ongoing while we overlook other situations that are truly tragic, such as the recent massacre of 57 people who had come together to support a presidential election candidate in the Philippines.</p>
      <p sl="it">All parliamentary groups, with the exception of ours, support a motion for a resolution on Azerbaijan that is harsh and out of step with the partnership initiatives that we have undertaken. I am convinced that the strong views contained in the resolution put to the vote today may not only lead to the Azerbaijani Government stiffening relations with Europe, but may also have a counterproductive effect on the case of these two young people, in that this resolution could jeopardise the granting of a pardon.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this regard, I would like to remind you of the decision, adopted yesterday in plenary, whereby we rejected a resolution on the Aminatou Haidar case so as not to compromise the ongoing diplomatic negotiations. I feel that it is also contradictory that in the same session, two resolutions are being put to the vote, one on Belarus and the other on Azerbaijan, both very different in tone, when these two countries are part of the same Eastern Partnership.</p>

      <p sl="pl">When, on 11 November this year, Europe marked the anniversary of the end of the First World War, in Azerbaijan, a sentence of several years’ imprisonment was passed on some journalists who had dared to write about the country’s widespread corruption and unemployment. The journalists were officially charged with spreading hooliganism and terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the ranking produced by Freedom House, Azerbaijan has the status of ‘Not Free’. Reporters Without Borders say Azerbaijan is in 146th place out of 175 countries surveyed in terms of freedom of speech. Disturbing signals are also coming from analyses conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has evaluated Azerbaijan on the question of political freedoms. In this context, last year’s refusal by the authorities in Azerbaijan to grant concessions to foreign media, such as the BBC and Radio Free Europe, should not surprise anyone.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think the time has come for the European Union to review its approach to Azerbaijan and, taking advantage of the participation of Baku in the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Policy, to begin to exert greater pressure on the authorities there.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Azerbaijan is signatory to a number of partnerships with the EU. It is active in the neighbourhood policy as well as in the Eastern Partnership. This does not only relate to trade. Azerbaijan has also signed up to respect democracy, human rights and the rule of law. However, currently, these are all under serious threat with the present regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today we highlight the case of Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, which represents a crackdown on free media, free expression and civil society that is much deeper and wider than the case of merely two bloggers, as they have been called. They did indeed use new media like Facebook and Twitter for their youth organisation’s work, but the fact is that we do not even know why they are imprisoned as evidence to defend their case has not been admitted in the trial, and the trial did not meet international standards – and, indeed, looks fabricated.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we cannot rely on the Azerbaijani Government to stay true to its commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of the law through the various agreements it has itself signed with the EU, then Europe cannot consider Azerbaijan to be a credible partner at all; this is also true of trade relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">This resolution urges the Azerbaijani Government to adhere to its own promises and to start building its legitimacy in the international community by respecting its own citizens, granting them democratic and human rights and allowing for respect of the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday, we awarded the Sakharov Prize in this House of the European people, and we saw a very impressive speech by the laureate, Mr Kovalev, who said that fear can only be met by freedom of thought, and freedom of thought can only be expressed when freedom of expression is actually guaranteed and when we listen to those people who are simply addressing issues such as opposition to their government, which we, as Europeans, have to guarantee in partnership with Azerbaijan in all areas.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the previous speaker has already mentioned some of the details of this resolution. The resolution was prompted among other things by an incident in July 2009 in which two young bloggers, Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, were attacked in a restaurant, went to the police to report the incident and were then arrested themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">They were prosecuted and, according to all the international observers, including Amnesty International, the court proceedings were far from fair. For example, the video which was apparently taken in the restaurant, which clearly showed who had been attacked and that the attackers were other people and not these two bloggers, was not played.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore clear that the judgment does not meet the criteria required by a state under the rule of law. I very much hope that all the evidence will have to be presented in the second trial when it takes place.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a resolution which is supported by almost all the groups. I regret that Mr Provera’s group is not joining us and instead is emphasising that we should wait for the case to resolve itself and to make use of the diplomatic channels.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Provera, I believe that it is necessary for Parliament, which is in partnership with the Parliament of Azerbaijan, to express itself clearly. Human rights represent a fundamental issue. Mrs Schaake referred yesterday to the Sakharov Prize. We must speak out in support of freedom of thought in all parts of the world and ensure that it is protected.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Aliyev has often said how important the rights of every journalist are and that they must be defended by the state. It is our job to remind everyone of this and I very much hope that in future, there will be another resolution on partnership between the Parliament of Azerbaijan and the European Parliament, as unfortunately this was unsuccessful two weeks ago.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the attention drawn to the appalling and consistent crushing of human rights in Azerbaijan: no freedom for the media, dozens of journalists jailed, some beaten, some even killed in recent years. But we must ask why the regime of Mr Aliyev is implementing such horrific repression. The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country. The ruling elite has enriched itself fabulously, especially in the oil and gas industry, while 90% of the population of Azerbaijan live in acute poverty and have seen no benefit from the natural resources of their country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Western governments and multinational corporations act, as usual, with great hypocrisy in this regard. They routinely deal with the regime to facilitate doing business, and the corporations make massive profits from the exploitation of the natural resources properly belonging to the people of Azerbaijan. Western governments should be asked why they do not demand that the oil-well be used to transform the lives of the people, instead of propping up this regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Members of the European Parliament, quite correctly, are harsh in their condemnation of the crushing of the right to dissent and to demonstrate freely in Azerbaijan, and I cannot let this opportunity pass to also condemn the disgraceful repression of protests by the Danish police in Copenhagen in recent days, who arrested up to 1 000 entirely peaceful protestors, handcuffed them and left them lying for hours in the cold.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I protested and demanded the release of some CWI colleagues, the police themselves told me that it was preventive arrest, preventive detention. What goes for Azerbaijan should certainly go for a Member State of the European Union as well.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in Azerbaijan, for fairly mild and delicate criticism of the government, two people have gone to prison after being given stiff sentences. What does this mean?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, that the country does not have good legal institutions, and it does not look like such institutions are going to arise. Secondly, that Azerbaijan has an authoritarian system which is taking control of more and more areas of political life. Every concession is punished. What can we do in this situation?</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should certainly intervene in every specific case of the violation of justice, as we are doing in this debate. Such interventions have quite often been successful. It is significantly more difficult to force institutional change. To date, the efforts of the EU in this area have been unsatisfactory, partly because we are still lenient towards some tyrants and vociferous in our criticism of others. The representatives of Memorial mentioned this several times in this House.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We also have problems in part because the process of coming out of authoritarianism is very difficult, arduous and prolonged. It is a very pessimistic conclusion, but I close with this thought: in spite of everything, we should not cease in our efforts, and should be consistent in exerting pressure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at the beginning of this year, the European Union made a statement on freedom and media in Azerbaijan. I regret the fact that, after concern on media freedom was expressed during the regular meeting with Azerbaijani parliamentarians, there has been no feedback. The European Parliament therefore has to take a stand. This is, by the way, going to be our last resolution adopted in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main concern of the EPP Group, and I am happy that all factions share the same concern, is the deterioration of media freedom in that country. The widespread practice of harassment, persecution and conviction of opposition journalists is alarming. We call on Azerbaijani authorities to release the journalists in jail without further delay. This also concerns two young bloggers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second problem is a recent decision by Azerbaijani authorities to cancel the FM radio licences of several international radio stations like Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, BBC World Service and others, depriving listeners in this country of valuable and independent sources of information. Here I ask colleagues to agree to an oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution: namely, not only to voice regret at the situation, but also to urge the Azerbaijani Government to cancel its decision and renew FM licences for the radio stations mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Variety, freedom and independence of information are key to a robust civil society, as Sergei Kovalev told us yesterday in this Chamber. This applies fully to the EU’s relations with Azerbaijan too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Azerbaijan is an important partner of the European Union. It is certainly an essential partner in efforts to ensure European energy security.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, no matter how important oil and gas are, they are not everything. Azerbaijan has made commitments to work for a democratic and pluralistic society, as enshrined in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Eastern Partnership policy, in which Azerbaijan intends to participate fully. We should applaud steps in the right direction taken by President Aliyev, for example, to free 119 prisoners, including five journalists, at the end of 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the situation of media freedom is only getting worse. We have a number of cases to support this claim, such as the situation of bloggers, the licences of the BBC, Radio Free Europe, etc. We must not shy away from reminding Azerbaijan that people must have the right to speak out freely, even if this means having critical views towards their governments. That is the basic principle of a democratic society, and a democratic Azerbaijan has to be an aim just as important as …</p>

      <p sl="lt">Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy. Azerbaijan ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and has undertaken to observe the provisions of Article 10 of this convention, which is devoted to freedom of expression and information. This Article establishes every person’s right to freely express their opinion, receive and share information, without let or hindrance from governing institutions. Azerbaijan also has made a commitment not to flout human rights and not to impinge on individual freedoms and to safeguard the principles of democracy in its country by participating in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership initiative. However, recently in Azerbaijan, the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association has increasingly come under threat and media activities are restricted. There is growing violence against journalists and civil society activists. I would like to urge Azerbaijan to take into account the European Parliament’s proposals and encouragement to improve the human rights protection system and to ensure respect for media freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Azerbaijan has appeared once again on the agenda of the European Parliament. We spoke about Azerbaijan in the last parliamentary term, when we adopted three resolutions, including one about freedom of the media there. We also spoke about the Southern Caucasus, again including Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are interested in Azerbaijan and have a great deal of goodwill for the country. It is trying to find its way step-by-step, and, indeed, is moving ever nearer to the western world, and not to the east. We should appreciate this. I think that we look upon Azerbaijan with a great deal of goodwill, and also on the authorities there. However, that goodwill must not order us not to speak out about things we do not like. Certainly, a situation in which two bloggers are locked up because they say what they think about the authorities is something which should not take place.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should support the pro-European tendencies of the Azerbaijani authorities, because all the time, a political discussion is going on there about whether to be closer to the European Union or to Russia. In so doing, we should support all those who want to be closer to the western world. However, when supporting them, we must talk about the values which make up that world – freedom of the press and freedom of expression are a fundamental value, and we should make this very plain.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Azerbaijan is certainly not in an easy position, because Russia is trying to rebuild its area of political and economic influence, but when helping the Azerbaijani authorities to draw nearer to the EU, we must speak out about the country’s deficiencies.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Freedom of expression is a very important feature of a democratic society. It is therefore correct that the EU monitors very carefully any actions aimed at intimidating those who openly criticise the mistakes of government officials.</p>
      <p sl="sk">From this perspective, I understand the challenge of the European Parliament to the Azerbaijan office expressing disquiet over the results of a police investigation mounted against young people who make satirical references to visible shortcomings in the political life of the country. I agree that we cannot ignore the clearly unfavourable signals coming from Azerbaijan and I do not doubt the criticism of the political environment in Azerbaijan, but I also feel that there has been no emphatic criticism from the European Parliament concerning the current events in the Philippines, where 57 political hostages have been murdered. In my opinion, we should address all issues that shake the democratic world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, following the first European elections in 1979, I had the honour of working with Otto von Habsburg, who is now seriously ill, to establish the human rights tradition of the European Parliament, including these topical and urgent debates on a Thursday afternoon. I was elected to the European Parliament in 1994 and I had the honour of working with Mr Schulz and others to further develop this human rights tradition, which we are rightly proud of. For this reason I was shocked when Mr Provera said with reference to Mr Schulz, who did not deserve this, that the case should not be taken up and almost repeated the threats made by the regime in Azerbaijan to civil rights activists in the country by saying that they will have to put up with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The human rights prize has already been mentioned today. I remember well that when we expressed our support for Andrei Sakharov, Vytautas Landsbergis and other campaigners for civil rights, people said at the time: Please do not get involved. We will make use of the diplomatic channels and you are causing more harm than good. Now we know that it was decisive for these people that Parliament spoke out clearly on their behalf. Therefore, Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, let us continue our tradition of independence on a Thursday afternoon. I would like to ask the group chairs to give us some freedom to act.</p>
      <p sl="de">This has nothing to do with party politics. During the last session, one Member said that as we were just about to hold meetings with China, we could not talk about China. Today it was a different subject, the Western Sahara. Perhaps this is justified in individual cases, but I am seriously concerned about our human rights work. Ladies and gentlemen, the case of Azerbaijan demonstrates how important it is to be discerning here. The country was a Soviet satellite state. Monocultures were established, the country was destroyed and subjected to a brutal regime. Now it is slowly beginning to become more democratic. As a member of the Council of Europe, it has committed to human rights and we must help it to continue along this route.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I, too, support what Mr Posselt said earlier. At the same time, I would ask for the Azerbaijani Government to respect the right of freedom of expression of every citizen and to immediately drop the charges against the two young men, accused on the basis of fabricated evidence, as Mrs Lunacek mentioned earlier. I believe that this action must be taken urgently because the situation with regard to press freedom in this country has deteriorated sharply, as is also indicated by the latest reports from the Council of Europe and OSCE.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also think that the Azerbaijani Government must take this action urgently because it must respect the commitments arising from both the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I will conclude by saying that I, too, was shocked by the turn of events today with regard to Mrs Haidar, all the more so as the suffering she is going through could be avoided through good cooperation between the Moroccan and Spanish authorities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to quote from Article 47 of the Constitution of Azerbaijan: ‘Everyone may enjoy freedom of thought and speech.’ Unfortunately, they are only empty words, for the constitution is not respected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For over five years, I have been a member of the EU-Southern Caucasus Parliamentary Cooperation Committees. I visited Azerbaijan during every joint parliamentary session. In one of the documents, there is a point about the violation of the principles of freedom of speech, and about how journalists and publishers end up in prison, often on fabricated charges, and that they are not given medical help when they are ill. We have a case of a journalist who died because he did not receive medical assistance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I had the opportunity to visit Azeri prisons. The standards which are found there are far different from those to which we are accustomed in Europe. It is good, therefore, that we keep on saying that in Azerbaijan, the principles enshrined in the constitution should be respected.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Azerbaijan is important to the European Union as an energy producer and transit country, and also as a contributor to regional stability in the Southern Caucasus. Azerbaijan is one of the six partner countries under the Eastern Partnership, and we attach great importance to respect for the common values underpinning this relationship.</p>
      <p sl="en">A partnership and cooperation agreement has been in place for 10 years. However, Azerbaijan has expressed its interest in building closer relations with the European Union by concluding an association agreement to replace it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the decision of the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in September to start preparations for concluding such agreements with the Southern Caucasus countries, discussions on the negotiation directives, including for Azerbaijan, are now ongoing.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the Council’s decision, the start of negotiations for all the Southern Caucasus countries will be conditional on sufficient progress in meeting the necessary political conditions, namely the rule of law and respect for human rights, the principles of the market economy, as well as sustainable development and good governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Each year, we draw an in-depth and balanced assessment setting out progress made by each partner country to implement their action plans under the European Neighbourhood Policy. We have just started the preparatory work for the 2009 report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not want to pre-empt our report but would like to make a few remarks, particularly on the situation regarding fundamental freedoms and human rights. In our 2008 report, we stated that ‘Azerbaijan has made good progress in economic development, but continues to show a poor record of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, we have unfortunately seen some negative developments, including changes to the Constitution, the abolition of limits on the mandate of the Head of State, as well as the detention and subsequent condemnation of two bloggers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Negative developments also include the continued persecution of human rights defenders, opposition activists and journalists, in addition to further deterioration of media freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has, in its various contacts, taken up these issues at all levels with the authorities and will continue to do so. At the same time, the Commission is mobilising a wide range of tools to assist Azerbaijan to meet the challenges of a new agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are using assistance under the ENPI instrument. We provide targeted support under the comprehensive institution-building programme. This will have important elements related to the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Azerbaijan will also benefit from assistance under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement, we are proposing to set up a subcommittee dedicated to justice, freedom and security, and human rights and democracy. This will constitute an important and additional forum for communicating our messages.</p>
