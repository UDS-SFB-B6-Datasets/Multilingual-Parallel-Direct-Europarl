      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Marianne Thyssen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the report with recommendations to the Commission on the report of the Presidents of the European Council, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup ‘Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union’ (2012/2151(INI)) (A7-0339/2012).</p>

    <intervention id="2-008-000" speaker_id="1832" name="Marianne Thyssen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak today about the completion of economic and monetary union we are not holding a technical debate but a political debate. What we are doing today is making fundamental choices for the Europe that we wish to bequeath to our children and grandchildren tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the short term the interests of our Member States may well differ, but in the long term they will of course be in line with each other. As Members of the European Parliament we have a moral duty to think and to act for the long term in order to give Europeans decent opportunities in the future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, we must approach this in such a way that our citizens are involved, because in the end they are the ones and the only ones that legitimise our policies. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what is at stake in the debate that we are conducting here today. The key words for me are crystal clear: hope and confidence. The confidence must return because business people and families must dare to invest and banks must again dare to lend money because the economic engine must start up once again to create growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must also give people hope. There are prospects for improvement. We shall come out of this crisis stronger but only if we act courageously, decisively and energetically.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this report we are giving an unambiguous signal to the heads of state or government. Each of the four pillars of the Van Rompuy roadmap must be very ambitious. In this way we shall show that European banking supervision really must come about and that the two proposals for regulations must be treated as one legislative package on which we can jointly decide via the ordinary legislative procedure. We shall demonstrate that supervision must be high quality within a European mechanism with accountability to the parliaments; that the Member States that participate must mandatorily or via an opt-in have equal rights in the supervisory board of such a mechanism; and that we as Parliament will perform our work on time so that hopefully by 1 January we can officially launch this mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The legislative proposals concerning deposit guarantees and a common framework for the resolution and restructuring of banks, the two other pillars of the banking union, must be dealt with as a priority. Afterwards we can look further into whether it is necessary (and in what sense) to work towards more European systems.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Then there is of course budgetary union, Mr President, which is not unimportant, because structurally healthy public finances are stimulating and absolutely vital. As far as budgetary union is concerned, in the first instance we must stand by and implement everything we have already decided here, that is to say: the six-pack. As it depends upon us, this week the two-pack trilogue negotiations must be finalised. Work must also be carried out with regard to income. The coordination of taxes must be looked at, tax fraud must of course be combated and damaging tax competition must be cleared up. The rapid introduction of the financial transaction tax (FTT) and the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB), whether or not by means of closer cooperation, is essential. Parliament may find itself in the situation of a gradual transition to a debt discharge fund where the strict conditions required are satisfied, because in that regard we cannot afford to take any risks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Through a stronger economic union we must of course complete all this so that we really aim for sustainable economic growth with more job opportunities and greater social cohesion. We now need structural reform in order to be able to reap the rewards in the future. There must be a better business climate, there must be a point to investment, the internal market must be completed, there must be a mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy and we must of course request that greater attention be paid, which we are in fact doing, to a number of basic social principles that we have set out in a social pact.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now we come to the fourth pillar: democratic accountability and transparency. This is naturally of vital importance, because without democratic foundations no policy will stand up in the long term. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we need to do today must not be delayed. We shall today make clear choices and the rest is up to the heads of state or government.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I would like to begin by thanking you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this important debate.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would especially like to thank Ms Thyssen for her report and for the valuable contribution it makes to the ongoing process of deepening economic and monetary union. As you know, this process began with the European Council’s decision in June, which called upon the President of the European Council to work in close collaboration with the President of the Commission, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank on the development of a specific and time-bound road map for the achievement of genuine economic and monetary union (EMU). It is expected that this road map will be presented to the European Council in December. As part of the process of preparing for the December meeting, we paid serious attention to the various issues raised in Ms Thyssen’s report on each of the four pillars, namely the financial, fiscal and economic pillars and the pillar of democratic legitimacy. I know that President Van Rompuy informed you about the outcome of the discussions on the European Council’s interim report in October. You are therefore well aware of the progress achieved to date. I would like to remind you briefly of some of the main points in each of the four constituent elements of EMU. The creation of a banking union is a key element in the creation of a genuine EMU. There is a clear need to strengthen the European Union’s banking sector and to move towards a unified banking framework which will be as open as possible to Member States that wish to participate. Our aim is to increase stability and ensure sustainable prosperity. Developments in recent years have shown that high-quality bank supervision is of the utmost importance, together with a single rule book to support it. We have all been called upon to work towards an agreement, before the end of the year, on the legal framework for one of the basic components of the single supervisory mechanism. The Presidency intends to make every possible effort to fulfil this remit, and I am sure we all share this ambition. It is important, of course, that we should ensure a level playing field, both for Member States participating in the single supervisory mechanism and for non-participating states, while fully respecting the integrity of the single market in the financial services sector. A balanced and acceptable solution is needed regarding these changes to voting arrangements and decisions by the European Banking Authority, taking account of possible changes to participation in the single supervisory mechanism. It is necessary to ensure non-discriminatory and effective decision-making within the single market. The discussions in the Council have shown that there is groundswell from Member States and that Member States are willing to reach a balanced agreement. This is very positive. We are also going ahead with the work on parts of the single rule book, including the aim of achieving an agreement on the revised capital requirements and achieving significant progress on the proposal on bank recovery and resolution before the end of the Cyprus Presidency. As regards fiscal and economic deepening, much has already been achieved. We must implement and use the tools agreed in the package of six legislative acts, within the framework of the European Semester, with the special recommendations for each country, as well as the tools agreed in the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. Additionally, the package of two legislative acts (the ‘two-pack’), which is under negotiation, should further improve economic governance and financial stability in the euro area. The Council modified its position on the two-pack last week. I believe this will help us to reach an agreement with the European Parliament, with a view to approving the proposals before the end of the year. In the long term, we must further broaden EMU if we wish to ensure stability and sustainable prosperity. In October, President Van Rompuy was invited, with the other Presidents, to examine ideas such as the potential for financial capacity and the conclusion of contractual arrangements between Member States and the institutional bodies of the European Union, with regard to the reforms which are specified in the special recommendations for each country. Democratic legitimacy and accountability will be crucial to the success of EMU. We must respect the basic principle that democratic scrutiny must be carried out at the level at which decisions are taken. This entails closer cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament. At the same time, the procedure for further integration must be built on the institutional and legal framework of the European Union, and this framework must remain open and transparent for all the Member States. Mr President, honourable Members, I look forward to hearing your views and I shall be pleased to pass on to President Van Rompuy the issues which are raised here today. I also know that the President of the European Parliament has the opportunity to exchange views on this subject in the course of his contacts with the other Presidents. I look forward, and shall be giving close attention, to your contribution to this process. We greatly appreciate the opportunity you are giving us to discuss the issue this morning.</p>

    <intervention id="2-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, good morning to you all. I would like, first of all, to give apologies on behalf of Commissioner Rehn, who has been detained in Brussels this morning by an important Eurogroup meeting on Greece, and who has asked me to speak for him, though on matters which, in part, also fall within my own areas of responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, thanks to Ms Thyssen for this report, and to the other honourable Members concerned, including all of the committees working across this area – namely, the Committees on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Constitutional Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs and Budgets – for their collective work. I am also aware, Ms Thyssen, of the very significant work you have undertaken, together with Mr Giegold, on one of the aspects which concerns us most directly: strengthening economic and monetary union, that is to say, establishing – we now hope speedily – a European supervisory mechanism for the banking sector as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your report provides the Commission with specific recommendations on the report of the four Presidents on framing a genuine economic and monetary union. Ms Thyssen, your contribution is very substantial but also – at this moment – particularly timely. The European Union is facing major challenges, which largely stem from the financial crisis originating in the United States, from the economic and social crisis that has accompanied that financial crisis, like our own budgetary crisis, and from sovereign debt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These crises call for specific responses, particularly in the area of finance – and that sums up what we are doing together with an extremely tight agenda: 28 regulatory laws have been put before you in the last two and a half years – but also, over and above the specific responses, broader, more global responses, since these crises have brought to light certain weaknesses and inadequacies in economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is all to restore what you yourself expressed in two key words, Ms Thyssen: trust and hope. These are responses which the Commission has been trying to propose for more than three years, led by José Manuel Barroso, our President, with your highly vigilant support, never too accommodating but always active.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, the Commission is particularly determined to propose every appropriate measure for framing a genuine economic and monetary union which functions better and is resilient to crises. We have already made great strides in this direction over recent years: the six-pack and the two-pack, prepared by Commissioner Rehn, form a set of rules enabling economic governance of the euro area to be strengthened considerably. I am also thinking of the proposals for a banking union. We must go further, however, and act more globally: in the coming days the Commission will propose a blueprint presenting the features of a deeper economic and monetary union, as well as the tools and instruments we need to realise this project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the light of these challenges and this ambition, I would first like to emphasise the very broad convergence of the views you express in this report and our own analyses and the Commission’s proposals. We share the same desire to act immediately and in a large number of specific areas – where there is, in fact, a need to go further – these areas being well identified in your report and essential if we want to strengthen economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, and most significantly, we come together on the importance of speedy adoption of the texts currently being negotiated in Parliament and the Council. The two-pack on strengthening economic governance; the single supervisory mechanism; the establishment of a single European framework to prevent and resolve crises – Ms Thyssen, you referred to these – they are two texts I presented, the first a year and a half ago on deposit guarantees, for which Mr Simon is rapporteur, and the second on resolution of banking crises, for which Mr Hökmark is rapporteur. The latter text has also been under discussion for more than seven months now. Then, lastly, Capital Requirements Directive IV, with which many of you are involved and which is currently being finalised by means of very active trialogues. It is both important and necessary for us to find solid compromises on these various texts and, in that regard, I would like to thank Mr Louca for the commitment and pro-active approach shown by the Cyprus Presidency in relation to all of these texts. We must strengthen the current legislative framework in this way and show that European commitments lead to results, and, quite simply, that we are doing what we said we would to tackle these crises, at the last European Council of 29 June in particular. It is also a matter of credibility and trust, which we must regain. We must also ensure that texts intended to strengthen economic and monetary union are fully consistent with proper functioning of the single market; as far as possible, they must also be open to the other Member States which have not, or have not yet, joined the economic and monetary union and the euro. That is another concern I want to deal with in the context of integrated supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, I would now like, on behalf of Commissioner Rehn, to touch on the proposals your report makes in three areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, your report is right to highlight the strengthening of democratic legitimacy. As co-legislator, Parliament naturally has a decisive part to play in designing the regulatory framework governing economic and monetary union. The responsibility of euro area decision-makers to Parliament is just as important. Here the key principle is that democratic responsibility must be exercised at the level at which the decision is taken. When the decision is European, democratic responsibility must, indeed, be exercised at European level. Your report also proposes a greater mandatory presence of the Commission and the production of regular reports for Parliament. The Commission, honourable Members, of course recognises the importance of transparency and involving Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That said, if we want an effective system of accountability, we must ensure that those accountable to Parliament are indeed those politically accountable for policy decisions and their implementation. In short, in the context of economic dialogue it is the Vice-President for Economic and Monetary Affairs and for the euro who is politically accountable. Today, therefore, it is Commissioner Rehn who will continue to respond to Parliament as much as you wish. This political accountability must not give way to a situation where Commission technical staff are directly accountable to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the report also advocates an enhanced role for Parliament in coordinating economic policies in the context of the European Semester, particularly at the time the annual growth survey is being drawn up. I would also like to remind you that the Commission presents its proposals for the annual priorities of the European Semester in its annual growth survey. In line with your request, the request made in your report, Ms Thyssen, this year the survey will be published at the same time as the report on the alert mechanism. The annual growth survey is therefore a Commission communication and its presentation arises naturally from the latter’s right of initiative. It is essential for Parliament and the Council to express their views on the Commission’s proposals once they have been published, in a process of political debate on future priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another important aspect concerns transparency and democratic accountability in the context of the European Semester: Parliament has the opportunity – introduced by the six-pack – to conduct economic dialogues with the other institutions and the Member States. The Commission supports Parliament’s active use of economic dialogue and would welcome even more active use of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, when reflecting on the stages needed to complete economic and monetary union, I think it is very important that we make use of all possibilities offered by the current Treaty, but that does not prevent us from identifying what might ultimately require changing in the Treaty. We are pleased that Parliament takes the view that the current Treaties do in fact leave us wide room for action and manoeuvre, which we use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, overall, Ms Thyssen’s report attests to a broad convergence of views with the Commission, something that does not surprise us. We all share the same key political goal – which is the main thing our compatriots, our citizens, expect – of providing a genuine global response to the current crises by doing what we have decided, and perhaps going further, by consolidating our economic and monetary union once and for all. The key thing, in my view – Ms Thyssen said it, as did Mr Louca – is the substance, the essence of the reforms we have begun together to increase the competitiveness of the European economy, financial stability, and, ultimately, trust.</p>

    <intervention id="2-011-000" speaker_id="1985" name="Pervenche Berès" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sees this end-of-year meeting as of major significance, since in order to achieve a genuine economic and monetary union we must revisit its foundations, which clearly did not withstand the crisis in which we find ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The work done by this Parliament, under the responsibility of Ms Thyssen – whom we all thank for the excellent quality of the work – is meant to make clear, to define, Parliament’s position with a view to this major European Council meeting in December. I am therefore surprised by the absence of Herman Van Rompuy, its President, for whom this work is intended.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, I consider that the result of our vote here will give our sherpas a mandate to represent us in the negotiations in preparation for this work. We also consider that this meeting cannot be downplayed or underestimated in the light of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. Rewriting a genuine economic and monetary union must remain the priority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this area, it is necessary to raise the social issue: we have been greatly struck by the fact that the document put on the table by Mr Van Rompuy in June defines four pillars, without ever mentioning the social dimension. Yet if you look at the Treaty of Maastricht, if you look at the current state of economic and monetary union, it is obvious that there is an imbalance between the economic policies defined in Article 121 and the employment policies defined in Article 148. However, if you rebuild economic and monetary union on the basis of Mr Van Rompuy’s proposals, without taking account of this original balance, you will destabilise the entire mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, Parliament, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also sets great store by parliamentary control, democratic control, and therefore the chance for Parliament to participate, under the ordinary legislative procedure, in the Annual Growth Survey establishing the framework for this European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A final point, Mr President, to highlight an element not mentioned often enough. If we want the troikas to succeed, they must be expanded to include the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which has today denounced the failure to abide by the ILO fundamental conventions in Greece, following the work of the troika. A genuine economic and monetary union cannot ignore the very foundations of the European social model.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-012-000" speaker_id="96892" name="Roberto Gualtieri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental message of this report is that a single currency cannot simply be a system of rules but requires proper economic governance, with its own resources and full democratic legitimacy. A genuine Economic and Monetary Union should therefore be based on the EU institutions, around which a true European political space should take shape.</p>
      <p sl="it">Consequently, an increased role for Parliament is not a case of empire-building but is an essential condition for giving legitimacy and strength to the governance of the euro. However, we believe that a loose federation, based on a clear definition of roles, resources and powers between the EU and the Member States, would be more effective and democratic and, at the same time, more respectful of the national parliaments’ prerogatives than the model that has taken shape in recent years. Because of this, we support the idea of stronger fiscal powers based on own resources, the embryo of a proper European Treasury, provided that this operates within the EU budget and is based on additional resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason we believe that the ex ante coordination of economic policies can be increased and must involve Parliament on a different basis from the contract-based model indicated in the interim report. Because of this we believe that implementing common debt management mechanisms at EU level is unavoidable.</p>
      <p sl="it">So this means reinforced governance, but also different policies. Budgetary discipline should be accompanied by countercyclical measures that can guarantee a suitable role for public investment, and the protection and revitalisation of the European social model should become an integral part of the governance of the euro, a genuine ‘fifth pillar’ based on a social pact that prioritises youth and employment. With this report, Parliament is therefore promoting an ambitious vision and a clear and realistic roadmap. Firstly, full use should be made of the broad margins for manoeuvre offered by the Treaties; in the next parliamentary term, boosted by enhanced legitimacy from Parliament and the Commission, through the mechanism by which the European parties choose the candidate to be chair, a Convention should be set up that completes the process of building proper economic and democratic governance of the euro, which is essential if the crisis is to be overcome and Europe saved.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to thank Ms Thyssen for her detailed report. She has brought together a broad range of ideas that are represented within the groups in this Parliament. It is now important to make sound priorities for the forthcoming period.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In his interim report President Van Rompuy has made an important first move and it must now be seen how we can build on this further. It also means, though, that in the short term we must take important decisions – as Ms Thyssen has already said, the two-pack. We shall do our very best to wrap this up before Christmas this year. On behalf of our group I should like to emphasise further three priorities.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, banking union, with direct banking supervision at the European Central Bank and strengthening, not weakening, of the role of the European Banking Authority. Banks must once again be able to provide businesses with adequate loans. Banking union is crucial to restore confidence in our banking sector but that does require an ambitious European perspective. It means that all banks must come under one European regulator. It also means that we must not go for a two-tier arrangement of euro area/non-euro area, but the model must be attractive to make people want to join in; that is to say 27- instead of 17+.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, strengthening of the economic administration in Europe. That is necessary to increase the competitiveness of our social market economy. It requires a more binding Europe 2020 agenda, geared towards innovation, growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, the importance of strengthening democracy within Europe, strengthening the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. There are good proposals in Ms Thyssen’s report that I am also happy to emphasise.</p>

    <intervention id="2-014-000" speaker_id="96950" name="Liem Hoang Ngoc" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro area is again entering recession. The exit strategy advocated by the Council and the Commission until last June has plunged us into crisis. Euroscepticism is gaining ground.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, the Van Rompuy report, which must define the next stage of economic and monetary union, has particular significance. Sadly, the Council has refused to involve Parliament fully in drafting this roadmap. Ms Thyssen’s report is therefore the opportunity for Parliament to invite itself to the debate in order to send a strong message.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I salute the remarkable work done by Ms Thyssen, who has demonstrated the sort of constructive attitude that shows our fellow citizens that Parliamentary debate has a point. The point of this debate is to take stock of the levers so desperately lacking for the functioning of economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, an integrated banking union is needed to control the banks, guarantee deposits and resolve crises without taxpayers again having to foot the bill.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, a budgetary union is needed, within which the serious budgetary approach of Member States is matched by support for sustainable development on a European scale. This union must be given a budgetary capacity fuelled by new own resources, allocation of which must be debated within the framework of the Union method, this being the only way to guarantee solidarity among the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, a genuine democratic leap is needed, without which transfers of sovereignty will continue to be seen by our fellow citizens as so many powers commandeered by bureaucrats. Parliament, as the main agent of representative democracy, must therefore play a part at each stage of the European Semester. Parliament must be involved in the functioning of the European stability mechanism. Parliament must be able to monitor the troika, particularly when the International Monetary Fund itself declares that the troika has made a serious error.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last but not least, a social – fifth – pillar is needed to guarantee wage standards, preventing structural reforms from causing a recessionary spiral. A social pillar to prevent budgetary discipline from reducing the quality of public services and social protection. A social pillar to encourage integration of young people into the labour market and access to housing for all. A social pillar to reassure our fellow citizens, for whom Europe is synonymous with saving the banks on the one hand, but worsening most people’s circumstances on the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the strong mandate that Parliament must give its President on the eve of the November and December Council meetings. The Council will hear this message even more clearly if tomorrow it receives – thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen– the largest possible majority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all I would like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, who did a magnificent job.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to start by addressing the so-called fourth pillar, democratic legitimacy, because I think that this is an issue which is under-exposed. In my view we do not only have an economic crisis, a banking crisis and a debt crisis; we have a democratic crisis, and the issue of democratic legitimacy is not a nice little extra that we can do once the economic crisis is over.</p>
      <p sl="de">No, democratic legitimacy is a precondition for solving the situation we are in. In this respect I have to say that I am extremely worried when I see that the European Union has taken major steps ahead over the last three years, but in an increasingly undemocratic, non-transparent way; increasingly intergovernmental and increasingly outside any Treaty structures. It is not even intergovernmental anymore. That is not the way to go.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to solve the situation, if we want to make that leap ahead into the future, then the democratic crisis is the first thing that we need to solve and I think there are some interesting elements in the report. I think one of the things that we need to look at very closely is individual accountability of European Commissioners, accountability before this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second issue that we need to look at again – which is not a nice luxury extra – is transparency. In a democratic political union, transparency is key to accountability. So far we have worked under the diplomatic method with the tradition of diplomatic discretion, but now we need transparency, we need openness, we need to enable citizens to watch what we are doing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament, too, should look very closely at the way it organises its work. We should enable ourselves to exercise meaningful parliamentary scrutiny, and I would like to add here as well that although Parliament should reflect the cultural diversity of Europe, we should not actually be speaking on behalf of the Member States. We are here to defend the general European interest and as I listen to the debates here I occasionally detect hints of nationalism.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally about banking supervision: I would still like to emphasise that although there is a need to move quickly to set up the banking union, we all know, as we are working on the proposals, that they are not sufficient in the long term. I think that we need, now already, to have a long-term perspective, because we know that the ECB cannot cover everything. It cannot cover the non-euro area countries; it cannot cover the non-banking sector; and I have too my question marks over the concentration of power. So I do think that we need a roadmap towards adequate and democratic banking supervision.</p>

I think we all have different political views here; we represent the interests of all European citizens, including the ones living in your country. That is the way I see it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think it is now clear to all of us why we talk of ‘four Presidents’ and not ‘five Presidents minus one’. They did not want to involve Parliament because of a clear understanding of the difference between a Van Rompuy paper, which becomes more evanescent with every version, and the one submitted by Ms Thyssen on behalf of us all. The difference in ambition is blindingly obvious. Clearly, either Parliament would have very much regretted finding itself in a gathering of Presidents ultimately very lacking in ambition or it would have struggled to make its voice heard, since its level of ambition clearly placed it in a minority.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Ms Thyssen clearly stated, Europe needs a federal leap. None of us will get out of this on our own, not even Germany! I hope the current economic downturn, also affecting Germany, will help our German friends to realise we are all in this together.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Thyssen shows ambition on all aspects of what this federal Europe must become. As regards the budget aspect, she dares, on behalf of all of us, to challenge a number of taboos and, in particular, to make it clear that it is absolutely essential that we work not just on budgetary spending but also on revenue, and that we cannot ensure adequate budgetary revenue without moving from a competitive approach to one of cooperation. The same is true on the issue of pooling debt, this clearly being an expression which Herman Van Rompuy is no longer able to write. He must have forgotten how to spell it or what it means. In any case, Parliament dares to write it in its report. It is an absolute necessity.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of economic union, we see Parliament clearly coming out in favour of stimulating investment in Europe. How else are we to understand this idea of making the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy more binding, it being nothing other than the European Union’s investment strategy? I am very glad that Ms Wortmann-Kool herself emphasised the need to act in this direction. We cannot, in my view, have an economic policy without a highly robust investment aspect. Similarly, a solid European budget, a European budget with its own resources, is just one element of this investment strategy. That is another statement that is completely taboo in other circles. We will see what this week’s Council brings. As regards banking union, Ms Thyssen points out, on our behalf, that we cannot design a banking union without establishing a single regime for resolving banking crises and compensating depositors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where a taboo is really broken is on the issue of social union. It is true that this is a difficult topic: we all have different histories in terms of social security and protection arrangements, but this report states the need for a form of social convergence, though not a race to the bottom. This, in my view, is another sign of ambition on the part of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, democratic union. This is the area where we were expecting the ‘five Presidents minus one’, who already gave us two reports before the summer, in which the democratic chapter became more diluted each time. There is now no trace of it, whereas in Parliament’s report we do not simply say that it would be good for Parliament to have occasional exchanges with national parliaments. This text proposes giving Parliament, the Parliament of the European Union and of the euro area, real powers to take decisions and shape the broad lines of European economic and social policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would simply like to close by saying that we do not have much time. Today, one European in four is at risk of poverty and social exclusion. One in four of our fellow citizens! The speaker from Hungary reminded us of that fact. Destroying the social fabric has its consequences. If you add to that the reminder from the World Bank this week – to the effect that we are in the process of bursting the planet in terms of its physical limits – and the fact that climate change carries inherent risks for humanity’s existence, I think we have to realise that we do not have much time and must act now. We know that otherwise we run the risk of seeing this continent simply descending into violence.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, there is no point in going into fine detail in today’s debate, but we should critically evaluate and analyse the whole concept of a banking union from a political point of view. I would like to add four observations.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Firstly, the creation of a banking union is not an economic solution to the economic difficulties facing the European Union. The essence of the economic difficulties is the high and unmanageable public debts and the associated failure of governments to cope with this reality with their respective policies. Therefore the fact is, with regard to the banking union, that it would only open the way to the recapitalisation of the banks from the European Stability Mechanism, which is not a solution to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Secondly, the banking union is not based on the current legal status of the European Union; it is a sudden project, not an evolutionary one, and it is a project that only enforces and prejudges a new system of governance. Advocates of a banking union themselves admit that their performance is subject to the completion of a fiscal union, elimination of tax competition, and harmonisation of taxes and the budgets of the Member States. This is not possible without a political union, however, and this has been admitted by representatives of the European Commission, including both President Barroso and Ms Reding. We do not want such a union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Thirdly, the banking union, if launched in the proposed format, will not be a project that would connect and further integrate the European Union; it will be a project which will divide and, in effect, deepen existing economic, social and social-structural cracks. This could be dangerous for Europe in the future.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Fourthly, and I think this should have been top of the list because it is a fundamental concern: a democratic mandate to create a disputed project must be thoroughly consulted on with citizens of the Member States, and based on what they want. If not, and if the banking union is created contrary to public opinion, it will be a problem rather than the solution.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we are now discussing a very important report, of which, however, people in the Member States remain unaware; in my own country, for example, the Finnish media have hardly even referred to it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For this reason, I am concerned about the same issue as many other representatives here, the Commission and the Council – in other words, that of democracy. The report promotes a clear advance towards a federal Europe, as regards both the concrete proposals and the principles which it sets out. I quote from the text of the report: ‘The intergovernmental method has reached its limits and is not well suited for democratic and efficient decision-making in the 21st century. A leap should be made to a truly federal Europe.’ There is thus no ambiguity regarding the report’s vision for the future of the EU and of Europe. In this respect the report sits entirely in line with that tidal wave of new regulation which has followed the euro crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Therefore, in order to promote civic debate and to ensure the genuine support of citizens, it is important for national referendums on the trend towards a federal Europe to be arranged. Mere discussion in Parliament is not sufficient. We need to receive direct support from the people, since if the people do not give their direct support for this move towards a federal Europe then their alienation from the EU can only continue, even while the integration of the EU ostensibly deepens. If this happens, then future national referendums will no longer be concerned with integration but with leaving the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in fact recent years have shown us that the Economic and Monetary Union has failed to withstand the crisis. They have also shown us that we had a European institutional architecture full of holes, in particular the institutional framework of the euro. That is why, when it comes to ambition, the report and the proposal presented here are a cut above the proposal presented by the governments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, as the rapporteur said, we are faced with policy choices, so I should like to explain why we have some reservations and cannot support this report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first concerns questions bound up with the conditions. We can see that we shall still have a scenario where there can only be solidarity between the various countries when we have achieved all aspects of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Intergovernmental Agreement, the Euro Plus Pact and a series of measures imposing nothing less than massive doses of austerity in peripheral areas and also a series of recessive measures that, as we have seen, are not working.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A second reason has to do with the banking union. The rapporteur, quite rightly, sets out the banking supervision mechanism, but it is so necessary that we cannot escape the essential and it is the essential which is escaping here, insofar as we are continuing to put together a patchwork of national systems, which means that we are all together on banking policy, we are all together on banking supervision, but we are all divided when something goes wrong and, therefore, the taxpayers will continue to pay the price.</p>
      <p sl="pt">And a third point has to do with the question of common debt and the issuing of Eurobonds. Here, once again, the possibility of debt issuance is being considered but only when it is already too late. We need common debt issuance now, not only once the excessive deficits and debts have been set right, since with the policies we are following they will never be put right; on the contrary, they will be ever more exacerbated to the despair of a whole series of communities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For this reason, Mr President, I should like to end by saying that, despite all the efforts, I think we have here a very clear example that united we could still stand, but divided we shall surely fall, which is why it was important to have gone even further.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, 15 years ago the Member States were experiencing prosperity, peace and mutual understanding. Now we are experiencing increasing poverty, riots and empty promises. Everyone outside Brussels understands that Europe has taken a wrong turning.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Despite that this Parliament wants to continue going down this path. Parliament wishes for a genuine monetary union in which the budgetary power of the Member States and thus their sovereignty disappear, a banking union where the door is open to recapitalise bankrupt banks via the European Stability Mechanism, with supervision through Brussels, which a year ago still called Dexia an excellent bank, and finally a transfer union in which northern taxpayers have to pay in perpetuity not only for their own social system but also for that of other countries. Everyone will end up poorer because of this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, sovereignty is something to be proud of and not a historical error. If this report is accepted, it will be because according to good socialist custom there are more profiteers than payers. I, though, shall vote against it. We must endeavour to achieve prosperity for everyone and not to redistribute poverty.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council in June identified what we need, and that is: more Europe. In addition to this, it also identified four important areas that we should be working on to ensure we have stable Economic and Monetary Union: in brief, integration. All those who have spoken so far have listed a series of problems, one of which – one of these areas we should be working on – is the need for greater democracy. I would make this the top priority, followed by an integrated financial framework, a single budgetary framework and a single economic and monetary policy framework.</p>
      <p sl="it">These four conditions are necessary to make progress along the road to greater European integration. The purpose of this report by Ms Thyssen is to express Parliament’s opinion, and that is only right. However, the report was also an opportunity for the various political groups to express their opinions and voice their concerns, and these were turned into a significant number of amendments. I congratulate Ms Thyssen, who has done an excellent job of drafting compromises and managing to find a solution that is as widely supported as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">I realise that there is uncertainty and that there are differing positions, but we must work together to find a framework that is as balanced as possible. Most of the concerns, though not all of them, are about the single supervisory mechanism for banking. I therefore maintain that we need to act quickly and send a clear message from Parliament to the Commission and Council. We really need to emphasise that the areas identified in June must be dealt with if we are to have a stronger European Union that can guarantee economic growth and more jobs, especially for the younger generations, because that is the challenge facing us.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Europe and the euro area have lost their vision of their future. This report tries to rediscover that vision and for that I welcome it. To that end, this Parliament’s position as regards the report drawn up by Ms Thyssen will have to be taken into account in the final text in December.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Very briefly, as regards its main pillars, I should like to stress the following. As regards banking union: this is now fundamental and this Parliament is making a serious effort here. As regards fiscal union: it cannot exist without serious measures to combat tax fraud and tax evasion, nor can it exist if the tough effort on public finance discipline is not linked to coordinated management of the States’ 20- or 30-year debt, stabilising the cost and making it possible to relaunch the economy. This is, moreover, Parliament’s proposal when it debates the Two-Pack.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The third pillar, economic union: today that stands empty and Europe needs two things. First a spur for growth, once we have reached a clear decision as to how to recreate productive capacity within Europe, which implies a review of external trade policy in an era of globalisation and of the industrial aspect of its internal policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fourth pillar: increasing democratic legitimacy implies, in the short term, making it possible to impose democratic accountability upon the Troika, in particular accountability to this Parliament. As regards the last pillar, which we would like to add and which we would like to see expanded, it is not possible to deal with the future of Europe without placing due emphasis on a social and fundamental rights pillar, which at present European citizens do not have.</p>

      <p sl="de">blue-card question . – Mr President, Ms Ferreira, I think your country is currently making a considerable effort and is making very good progress. Nevertheless, my question to you is: when you talk again about too little having been done to bring about growth and when you consider the decades during which Portugal received billions upon billions of euros from the net contributors, would you say that all these funds have been invested wisely – I am thinking here about parallel motorways – or that there has been a great deal of misallocation?</p>

      <p sl="pt">blue-card answer . – There are always margins for progress, but for Portugal the support of the European Union has been fundamental over recent years. Portugal was transformed from a country whose competitiveness was based on cheap labour into a country with a highly skilled, highly sophisticated workforce. However, an exporting country needs to be able to send its exports somewhere. That is why it is important for countries with spare capacity to open their doors to people with upgraded qualifications coming from countries with a specialisation profile that is completely unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One final note to say that emigration cannot provide the solution – that a workforce whose skills have been upgraded with European Union support should now be lost via a mass exodus of the most highly qualified individuals to countries with the margin to receive them. This is tragic and completely undermines our future.</p>

It is by spending the last 20 years talking to people about a common foreign policy that does not exist; we talked about being the most competitive part of the world in 2010, which they didn’t see materialise. Now, do you know what effect you will have at the European Council on Thursday if you take a decision that ignores a plenary vote in Parliament? If you do that for the European Central Bank, giving it an image that is not the one we want to see Europe have in the world, you risk completely removing any credibility from all your fine words about strengthening democracy. Therefore we will see on Thursday evening whether the European Council respects democracy or whether everything we do here is completely pointless.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Ms Thyssen, the rapporteur, and Parliament as a whole, which has worked together outstandingly well on this report. Both this collaboration and the actual report and its contents – when you compare it with the Van Rompuy paper – demonstrate how necessary it is for Parliament to get involved in these matters.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have reached a milestone. We are now no longer just fighting fires, we are no longer merely the fire brigade, but are in the process of shaping the architecture for a new, united Europe, for economic and monetary union, but also for the course that Europe should take as we head into the future. We need to acknowledge explicitly that we have placed the emphasis very firmly on freedom, an issue towards which Europe has a strong leaning. I am a fervent defender of freedom, but we have neglected equality, democracy and social issues in Europe. There is an urgent need for us to create more democracy in Europe, and we must take urgent steps to achieve greater solidarity in Europe, between countries and amongst one another.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe this will only be possible if we involve Parliament and citizens to a greater extent. The future of Europe is not in the hands of a few institutions, the presidents of the presidents. Europe’s future and the question of whether this continent can collectively emerge from the crisis depend on whether citizens regard it as their Europe and their responsibility. We will only manage to bring this about if we involve citizens through a democratic convention, through referendums on the outcome of this convention and by making clear that Europe is not about us, the institutions, but about you, all of us, and our future in a united Europe!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today’s debate and previous discussions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have focused on accountability and seeking solutions to the many outstanding issues which need to be resolved for banking union to work. The most important thing we, as parliamentarians, can do on this wide-reaching proposal is to guarantee legal certainty as far as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the US, the overarching financial crisis legislation, Dodd-Frank, has come under huge legal scrutiny. A few months ago the CFTC, which was charged with writing rules under Dodd-Frank, lost their legal case around position limits because the political agreement had been to look at where the position limits were necessary, whereas the CFTC had interpreted this as implementing them without consideration of necessity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The wrongs and rights of this case are obviously up to the US legal system. However, there are lessons to be learned about how political compromises can lead to legal battles in the court. Banking union will seek to supervise the euro area’s largest banks. These banks have large legal teams, which they will not hesitate to use. Unintended consequences need to be kept to a minimum and cross-cutting legislative issues identified and addressed in advance. Above all else, we must shy away from political fudges and ensure that we create a stable and legal framework that will truly stabilise the financial system.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I seem to be hearing is that we need to move towards genuine Economic and Monetary Union. Does this mean that everything thus far has been play-acting, that all the measures taken to date have not been real but simply the fruit of someone’s imagination? Unfortunately it was not and it was poisoned fruit that we were served. There is continuing emphasis on erroneous presuppositions, such as the need to standardise the economy and the irreversibility of the euro. In fact it is the one-sided euro contract that will be the downfall of a single European Union. The report states that the Member States that do not yet have the single currency are keen to join it. This is absolute rubbish, as Bulgaria and Poland, which do not want to join the euro, have shown.</p>
      <p sl="it">The potential for countries not to join the euro has, moreover, been confirmed. That is a good thing. But it cannot now be said that a single currency is the ultimate goal of the European Union, especially since measures for leaving the euro are being provided for, and indeed since it is already possible to leave the European Union itself under Article 50 of the Treaty. The report makes repeated use of the word ‘binding’; it talks about binding budgetary discipline and binding economic policy guidelines. So that would be Brussels, from on high and in a binding way, backing out of policies that are working for different European countries. We think that this is dangerous and unacceptable. We do not want to be slaves of Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have two brief comments on the report: firstly, I believe it is right and good that with this report the European Parliament is getting involved in the debate on economic and monetary union. After all, this is an issue of such importance that it cannot be left to the Council alone. To date, in the management of the crisis the Council has proven to be more a stronghold of nationalism than a place where European solutions are developed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, economic and monetary union is not sufficient. During the crisis many citizens viewed the work of the European Union, Parliament, the Commission and the Council as a means of supporting the banks. Whether that is true in all cases is a moot point, but that is the experience of many citizens: the banks are being supported, while the social situation of many citizens is becoming increasingly precarious.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not sufficient simply to talk about prosperity, as the spokesperson for the Council did. What is required is a social union that guarantees all citizens social rights. If we do not manage to achieve this, the EU will lose the support of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Europe that the European Council and the Commission are riding has strayed off course and now they really find themselves dangling over the abyss. What they lack is solid ground in the form of the support of the European people.</p>
      <p sl="de">We find ourselves in a very dramatic situation in which we all know that we need a strong Europe, but in which an increasing number of citizens are turning away, due to understandable fears, the reasons for which have been mentioned by previous speakers, from the Europe of the Council and the Commission, as they consider themselves to be unrepresented and actually view the European Union more as a banking union than a democratic union. This is where the main root of the problem lies.</p>
      <p sl="de">What they are now doing once again with these new texts, what the Council is steering towards, is patching up a boiler that, although it has not yet exploded, is threatening to do so. Fervent pro-Europeans like me have been saying here for many years that creating a union without democracy will not work. However, that is something we are once again doing to some extent in our paper, as presented by Ms Thyssen. It is a welcome development that a wide range of control instruments are being put in place and that we are supporting this, but our actions fall well short when it comes to democratic legitimacy. We should follow Mr Häfner and others. Yes, we need a convention. Yes, we do indeed need a fully fledged European Parliament and yes, we need referendums to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="de">You should summon up the courage for this before it is too late, as we can still secure the majority. However, I fear that the boiler will explode before we actually achieve a reform of this Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Thyssen’s report is a formidable piece of work, but rather than being a critical survey of the situation, it is – if I may say so – a non-binding wish list directed at the Commission. The convergence in this report that has been called for by many and that Mr Barnier has emphasised once again leaves many questions open.</p>
      <p sl="de">1. Why is this time pressure being applied here and within the legislative procedure without issues such as deposit guarantees, Eurobonds, the debt repayment fund or the European Central Bank having been intensively discussed?</p>
      <p sl="de">2. Some of the demands contravene the European Treaties. It is impossible to create confidence when there are breaches, for example of Article 126(6).</p>
      <p sl="de">3. The banking union, which forms a key part of the recommendations, destroys the single market for financial services, puts the independence of the ECB at risk and clearly contravenes the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="de">4. What use are declarations about parliamentary control if not even the President of the European Parliament is accepted as a full member of the Van Rompuy group?</p>
      <p sl="de">5. I believe, and here I share the opinions of Mr Häfner and in part also those of Mr Klute, that changes to the Treaties are required to strengthen the European Union – ones that are legally sound and, instead of being rushed, are well considered and worked out in a convention – rather than decisions that are taken under time pressure and only have the aim of rectifying national failings in the banking sector, such as those in Spain, Ireland, Belgium and France, after the event by means of the European bailout mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, anyone who wants more democratic control must finally take the Treaty of Lisbon seriously and reduce intergovernmental agreements and treaties. The Thyssen report makes no mention of this.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Ms Thyssen, on behalf of the Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who are on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for enabling us to discuss social issues in this debate. This is simply because, despite the fact that in President Van Rompuy’s document there is not a single word on the matter, we are experiencing the most serious social crisis in the history of the European Union. It is inconceivable that the document produced by the President of the Council does not contain a single word on unemployment or the situation of young people: in other words the situation of those who are losing out so much, through no fault of their own, due to the major crisis that we are suffering.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this continues to be the case because we still have the same problem that we had originally: the blind belief in the market that exists in Brussels in both the Commission and the Council. The belief is also that there are no other options and that there is no alternative to austerity administered like a purge in such a cruel way that it is going to kill the patient.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless we have the solutions in our Treaty, Mr Barnier. In it we have economic and monetary union, with a dimension of growth, social policy, employment and a high standard of living for Europeans. That is the approach that we should adopt in the new economic and monetary union. It is right that monetary union should be accompanied by a reinforced economic union, but we need that social pillar.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need that social pillar because we need the public. We need to integrate the millions of young people who are currently neither studying nor working. We need to protect the fundamental rights of workers, so that this crisis does not put an end to the European social model. What we need, Mr Barnier, is not to lose the soul of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, we must not leave it in the hands of blind bureaucrats or economists who are not seeing the drama and its real consequences. We need a return to policy, solidarity and the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, which was a community and not just a market.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The regulatory control of banks which operate in a number of countries must take place at European level. The European Central Bank (ECB) together with the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the national regulatory authorities should play a stronger role.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In many countries, as in my home country of Sweden, which is not a member of the euro area, it is important that the conditions for participating in a banking union do not give the euro countries an unfair advantage.

      <p sl="sv">It is also important that countries with a large banking sector are also able to impose higher capital requirements on their banks in the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This week, the Swedish Government requested an amendment to the Treaty. It should be reasonably possible to meet the requirements concerning influence without amending the Treaty, and I hope that this is possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will conclude with an appeal: do not divide the Union. Additionally, keep all doors open for the United Kingdom. We know from history what a divided Europe can lead to.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, economic and monetary union cannot be viable and sustainable without two indispensable ingredients: fiscal discipline and democratic legitimacy. Permanently strong fiscal discipline should result in structurally balanced budgets across the business cycle, in order to avoid debt traps. At the same time, for fiscal discipline to hold, solid democratic legitimacy is necessary, based on an enlightened political culture of civic responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this stage in the development of the EU, fiscal policy has to remain national because full democratic legitimacy exists only at national level. Setting budgets, imposing taxes and redistributing income are inalienable components of national sovereignty. That includes also the right of states to go bankrupt, while other states should maintain the right of refraining from bailing out bankrupt ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">For market capitalism and liberal democracy to survive in this century, bankruptcy should remain a credible threat not only for enterprises but also for central and sub-sovereign governments. Fiscal socialism, the demutualisation of debt without commensurate mutualisation of national sovereignty, is untenable and unacceptable. It will only destroy the remainder of European fiscal discipline and further weaken democratic legitimacy.</p>

The lesson still has not been learnt. We find ourselves in the current financial mess in large part due to the inefficiency of the European institutions. Angela Merkel recognised this by deciding to act intergovernmentally instead of interinstitutionally, during all the peaks of the crisis. Now we are being asked to empower the same institutions to be the supervisors of this new European Monetary Union, which will also result in an additional burden to taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a nutshell, this will entail more staff and even more money and will further remove powers from national supervisors, while the main problems remain unresolved. The EU needs to learn to do much less and do it better. More Europe simply makes a deep hole much deeper.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the draft report by Ms Thyssen does not bring to an end the budget fetishism that purely and simply pushes Europe into the abyss. In southern Europe the economies are constantly shrinking but in the Netherlands as well the economy has also contracted by 1.1 % in the last quarter. The fact that the conservative-liberal Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie is operating an irresponsible austerity policy goes together with its ideology. The party wishes for an ever-smaller government and sees social rights as an obstacle to competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the fact that the Social Democratic Partij van de Arbeid is contributing to this is completely incomprehensible. For the elections their leader, Diederik Samsom, still disassociated himself from the 3 % standard. Now he is contributing to dramatic austerity measures, while the International Monetary Fund is in fact encouraging countries like the Netherlands to invest and to strengthen consumer confidence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would call upon the Social Democrats here to distance themselves from the policy of their Dutch colleagues and to vote for our amendments in which we see the current special economic circumstances as an adequate reason for a prudent and therefore flexible application of the 3 % standard.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Marianne Thyssen on the excellent report she has delivered here. Once again Parliament is taking a leading role, a free position based on a very simple assumption: solving the problems of people who are suffering today in the streets, who have income problems, who have unemployment problems, is very much in line with the European policy option. Parliament is the body best equipped to say that and best equipped to explain that to citizens. Parliament is the body with the capacity to explain that we cannot continue with a short-term vision that goes forwards and then backwards. There is an extremely broad variety of subjects on which we have not adopted a joint position. We advocate fiscal union, but we are implementing that very slowly. We advocate banking union but the vision is not a total vision. And it is precisely the link between the short-term vision and the long-term vision which is needed in this report under discussion. Parliament is making progress towards that. I hope that the other institutions will also do so because, in all sincerity, there is no shortage of reports in Europe. They are pieces of paper but they do not then deliver anything concrete. Making things concrete entails the explanation of something very simple: the internal market requires a functioning currency. In order for the currency to work, we simply must take the road to greater political union, greater fiscal union, and a banking union that actually works. That is the only way to have a strategy that will constitute a single strategy as regards the investment that Europe so needs. That is the only way our citizens will have the opportunity to solve the problems which they are increasingly raising. Parliament is aware of that. Let us hope that the other institutions are too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the fiscal and budgetary part of the report and the proposal by the four Presidents. Indeed, we have a proposal on the table for a fiscal capacity for the euro area which is going to be discussed in December 2012 by the Heads of State. This is a profound proposal which has its own logic. Of course, the single currency also needs closer integration and convergence in terms of budgetary policies. I also think that from the experience we have had with countries that are under the programme it is indispensable that besides restructuring the national budgets and cutting costs, we provide the necessary financing to keep the economy running and solve some of the most important and serious social problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say that to maintain a single currency you also need a much larger budget but I am not going to touch on that. There are two ways to reach that aim. The first one is the one suggested by Parliament, and that is to have an overall approach vis-à-vis the fiscal commitments of the Member States for the European budget but also for different funds which would go to part of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other way is the one proposed by Mr Herman van Rompuy and this is to split and discuss separately these issues and eventually to go to an intergovernmental agreement. This second way would be very dangerous because both instruments depend on the national budgets; we have the same contributors and they cannot pay twice for two budgets – that is why we need to involve everything within the frameworks of the European institutions and reach a unity of the budgetary commitments.</p>

      <p sl="de">We have known for some time that the euro area can only be successful in the long term if it achieves greater integration and actually becomes a genuine economic, financial and monetary union. What that means in detail and what measures need to be taken emerge from the report put forward by Mr Rompuy this summer.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report was drawn up by four Presidents. There is one President missing, however, namely President Martin Schulz, the representative of our House. To me this demonstrates the little esteem in which our House is actually held by the Council. This is also made clear by the fact that the Council is now trying to rush through a very important issue, namely the introduction of a powerful supervisory mechanism for the banking sector at the European Central Bank, with Parliament once again having been assigned nothing more than a role on the sidelines.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as an economist I understand the intellectual arguments that for the euro area’s monetary union to work it also needs fiscal union and banking union, but the reality seems somewhat different to me. For fiscal union, you will not restore confidence in public sector finances without greater transparency on public sector debts. Eighteen months ago, Member States agreed to greater transparency but many countries, including big countries, are still not delivering.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on banking union you will not get strong supervision without a strong rule book. The so-called ‘single rule book’ is not a level playing field – it has many exemptions for big Member States, it does not meet global standards and it does not end the dangerous feedback loop between sovereigns and banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, monetary union, fiscal union, banking union does not equal the single market. This is not a new fact: it goes back to the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. If we want a single market of 27, then we cannot have a situation where those outside the euro area cede rule-making to the EU, whereas those within the euro area have exempted them and just have to comply or explain.</p>

I sometimes think when we have debates like this that we are underestimating the strengths and opportunities of the European Union we have. It is the genuine achievement of all the Member States that united and integrated and it is the world’s biggest economy, but we are not able to make it the world’s biggest and most dynamic market. That is why I am concerned about some of the proposals we are discussing, because we are risking more fragmentation rather than unity regarding developing the opportunities of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think in the end, if we do not do it right, we are risking a weaker Europe with more fragmentation, instead of a stronger Europe using all the opportunities. We need better supervision and we can achieve that all together. We need better crisis management of banks and we can achieve that. We need moral stability in public finances and we have the rules for that, but now we need to ensure that everyone is following that. We need to have lower taxes in order to become competitive, not new taxes. There is no new money. Just because we have a tax at European level that does not mean that it is free for the European citizens. We need to have an entrepreneurial single market at European level where the Commissioner here is responsible and doing his utmost, but also at the Member State level. We need to apply the single rule book. A lot of the things we need to do today we can do today and they will not be solved by institutional structures for tomorrow. We can make a stronger Europe today.</p>

I therefore allow myself to refer to paragraph 8 of the report that we are adopting today. With this paragraph this House calls on the Council to finally bring to a conclusion the legislative procedures relating to the realisation of economic and monetary union that are being blocked by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nine months ago this House adopted a key part of the banking union legislation, that relating to deposit guarantees, at first reading.

If we now endeavour to implement supervision quickly, we will be making use of the European Stability Mechanism. Also taxpayers’ money! A reliable deposit guarantee scheme, a reliable fund for the recovery and resolution of banks – these are funds that relieve the burden on taxpayers. Devote yourself to these funds with the same zeal! Make exactly the same progress with them! You will be judged on this by European taxpayers, but also by this House.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, first of all I welcome the report; secondly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Thyssen, for her fantastic work. She did not have an easy job, either in terms of the timeframe for the report or of its individual content. The report we have in front of us, ladies and gentlemen, is a kind of response to the Van Rompuy report, and forms an integral part of the package of measures to strengthen economic and monetary union. I am convinced that alongside coordinated economic policies and fiscal austerity measures from Member States, it is vital for the Union to have a supervisory framework which is accurate, and which is capable of covering, forecasting and under certain circumstances managing systemic risks. Thus the aim of this new regulation is not just to establish a more predictable regulatory environment; we will also hopefully manage to redress the imbalanced financial situation between banks and sovereign debts, whilst restoring confidence in the financial market. If all the elements of the banking union are realised, financing costs for euro area banks will fall, which in turn could have an indirect and positive impact on their lending operations, thus injecting new momentum to the European economy. It is therefore in our common interest to have a European banking supervision framework, but we also need to focus on the role this budding system will attribute to Member States who intend to participate but have yet to introduce the single currency. This is why, in my proposals, I strove to allocate a key role to striking a balance between the rights and obligations of these Member States, and to creating a financial guarantee that reduces or eliminates the distorting effect of the banking union. After the initial debates and differences of opinion, the draft report enjoyed broad support in our committee, which I am delighted about; it is also pleasing that this debate has not been closed and is continuing as we are able to express more detailed, more practical and more refined opinions in a further two legislative packages.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Maastricht Treaty was a milestone in the history of the European Union, through the creation of a single currency, which was supported by both an economic pillar and a monetary one. However, as monetary policy has taken shape with the successive adoption of European Treaties, the macroeconomic dimension has been confined to mere coordination. The lack of a true economic policy has deprived the Union of an adequate response to the crisis, which has led to serious social costs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To remedy these shortcomings, the European Commission proposes the creation of a banking union. I support this proposal. We need greater economic integration and the instruments necessary to deal with the current economic and social challenges. However, if we focus on the Single Supervisory Mechanism for banking without developing common rules to prevent banks from going bust and a single deposit guarantee scheme, we will repeat the mistakes that made the economic and monetary union fragile. At the same time, the exclusion of non-euro countries from the decision-making process in relation to the Single Supervisory Mechanism must be avoided.</p>

      <p sl="es">This House has called on previous occasions for the establishment of an integrated financial framework, budgetary framework and economic policy framework. At the Council in June the guidelines and roadmap were agreed, which we must now begin to follow. It is now the time to do what was agreed.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first step is banking union based on three pillars. Firstly, a single supervisor, which is the key to breaking the circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; a second pillar based on the common deposit guarantee mechanism; and a third pillar based on a common bank crisis resolution system.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are three basic pillars in order finally to begin to generate stability and confidence. In this sense, I support the European Central Bank taking on as soon as possible the powers to act as single independent supervisor over all banks, obviously with the cooperation of the national authorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to direct recapitalisation of banks, I support what was adopted at the Council in June, in which the possibility was confirmed of a direct injection of cash into the banks once the single supervisor begins operation.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, fiscal union is the other goal that must be achieved in the medium term, in order to achieve an authentic and genuine economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the same way, as a culmination of this whole process, we should move towards some sort of mutualisation of debt, in order to put an end once and for all to the differences in interest rates due to the doubts generated regarding the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, once again the Union finds itself at a crossroads and this time we have a choice between two paths. One way to go is a more loosely integrated framework for the 28 Member States, the second path will take us to a multi-tiered Union with a stronger, deeply reformed, euro area core. Recent policy reforms have aligned us closer to the second path. There are, however, risks that come with this multi-tiered approach potentially leading to a more fragmented single market, but also repatriation of some policies back to national level and a weaker role for the Union in the global world.</p>
      <p sl="en">An EU dominated by a strong core and a large periphery might give policymakers less firepower for a sound global position for Europe as a whole. The question of whether a single voice in international institutions for the core only will be the best solution might emerge. As this multi-tiered Europe becomes a reality, we should be alert concerning potential risks. We need to minimise unwanted spillovers to the greatest extent possible, and the core may be strong enough to provide the necessary impetus for this, but on the flipside it might not be sufficiently powerful to keep the EU together.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that I admire the efforts of Marianne Thyssen to keep us together and, at the end of the day, which scenario will materialise depends on the way we design and manage this ensuing multi-tiered structure. That is why our work is so important.</p>

Certainly, I have seen at home how my children, when they begin to play with wooden blocks, quickly learn that in order to build a house from blocks you first begin with the first row at the bottom, and then perhaps you leave an opening somewhere for a window, and then a cross-piece, and at the end you put on top some joists and maybe a bit of cloth as a roof covering.</p>
      <p sl="lv">What seems to be happening now, as we in Europe try to grapple with the crisis? It seems as if we have all collectively forgotten what we learnt in our childhoods. We are not building anything from the foundations up, but one person comes running up with windows, another arrives with joists, a third is saying something about foundations, while a fourth is already talking about the roofing. As a result we are simply not standing together on this issue, and the proof of this is that the financial markets still do not believe that in Europe we have found the solution to this.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Banking union is one of the issues where, in my view, not just the majority but an overwhelming majority of us understand quite well that this is the direction in which we ought to go. However, ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to remember and bear in mind the fact that we must construct this from the foundations up, and in these foundations we ought not to build in a difference between the euro area states and states outside the euro area, because in Europe the basis of our foundations is the single market, and the single market is the 27 EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="lv">We do not have a 27-speed Europe, and we do not have a two-speed Europe: we have a one-level, one-speed Europe.

      <p sl="nl">The Economist this week shows that the competitiveness of France forms a very considerable risk. Along with Greece and Spain, France may soon also become the sick man of Europe. The numerous proposals in the Thyssen report are wide of the mark. Ultimately the Bretton Woods system could no longer survive. Only when the linking with the gold standard was abandoned did new opportunities arise for the global economy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Furthermore, the current euro area can also not continue as it is. Only after the area is taken in hand will a genuine economic and monetary union be possible. If we neglect this approach then we will still be beating our heads against a brick wall.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Ms Thyssen has done an excellent job. It seems to me, however, that we are dealing with a number of questions that go beyond the scope of her report. When we have talked about banking supervision, when we have discussed, on various occasions, the general conditions for managing economic activities and protecting currencies in the European Union, we have always been confronted with difficulties that are not directly related to the issue, but do concern the relationships between the individual institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament is the institution with greatest exposure because it is the only one directly elected by citizens, but also the one with the fewest objective powers. I think perhaps the moment may have come to see the problem for what it is. We need a revision of the basic rules, that is, of the Treaty. If we do not start again from there, I am afraid that everything we do will always be dogged by the difficulties that these insoluble contradictions cause.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, with reference to today’s discussion, I would like to pose a few questions and adduce my comments:</p>
      <p sl="pl">1. The lack of a social dimension among the four pillars supporting the economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">2. Are Treaty changes necessary? We already have some instruments: the six-pack, the two-pack, the Fiscal Compact, the European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="pl">3. The question of openness to countries from outside the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">4. The need for full inclusion of the European Parliament in the work. There should be no talk of creating a separate assembly for the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">5. The problem of further transfer of rights to the level of the European Union. This means a loss of identity for Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">6. Effectiveness of action plans. Is the European Union reliable in its actions?</p>
      <p sl="pl">7. Citizens understand nothing of what we do. How can we best inform society in order to get across our intentions linked to economic strengthening and the various ways in which the crisis is being dealt with at EU level? Why specifically at EU level, and not just at national level? How does the budget for the financial perspective 2014-2020 stand in relation to this?</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Europe is still drifting. Efforts failed during the crisis to ensure the European political elite respond in time to these challenges, and the divisions appearing not just among members of the euro area are increasingly alarming. Today, these divisions are the most alarming. Coming from a new Member State, however, I also find it alarming that a deep chasm could emerge between Member States outside the euro area and Member States within the euro area in relation to the banking union, one that jeopardises the unity and the future development paths of the European Union as a whole. This is why everything my fellow Members have said is extremely important in my opinion – that the approach to managing the European crisis has resulted in an intricate and tangled mesh which very few of us in Parliament are able to understand, and which even fewer are capable of subjecting to democratic control.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the crisis is inseparable from the strengthening of Economic and Monetary Union and of the single market, which had a profound impact in destroying the manufacturing infrastructure of countries with weaker economies, in exacerbating and creating production deficits leading to budget deficits, and in increasing public debt. That is, contrary to the propaganda about the euro and Economic and Monetary Union, these instruments not only failed to act as a shield against the crisis, as was said, and as a weapon for tackling capitalist globalisation, but also very clearly revealed their true nature – instruments for tackling growing global competition between capitalist monopolies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The destruction of the sovereignty and independence of countries has proved to be indissociable from the process of fusing economic and political power, which accentuated the divergences and exacerbated unequal development, affecting in particular countries with peripheral economies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report aims to further centralise those powers, even advocating that the European supervisor should be able to wind down financial institutions, that is, to manage the process of monopolising financial capital as it sees fit. We do indeed need a worker-friendly currency instrument which favours economic growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ‘economic and monetary union is not an end in itself’, says the report. Quite right: it is an instrument to achieve political union. The report claims that it will achieve sustainable growth and a high level of employment, but it admits that unemployment in the 27 has risen by 50% from 2008 to 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">In those countries for which the euro is overvalued, mass unemployment and negative growth are directly attributable to euro area membership. If they were to leave the zone they would experience export-led growth and a fall in their unemployment. The euro-led recession in the South has not left the North unscathed. Its exports to the South have been reduced severely. More control and austerity measures will not reduce debt. They will reduce employment and profits, which will cut government revenue. This will lead to more debt rather than less debt.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would first like to thank you all for the quality of the debate and the frankness of your proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the start, Ms Berès, who is here, together with Mr Klute and a number of other honorary Members, mentioned something very important: striking a balance in everything we do. You referred to this new social pillar, this social dimension, which is, or is said to be, lacking in everything we do. I am concerned, and think the Commission should be concerned, by being challenged in this way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is my belief, honourable Members, that we have finally provided a global response to all of these crises. Moreover, that is why, after the 29 June summit, the reaction was somewhat favourable, a certain calm on the markets, because, after two or three years of urgent responses, with our backs to the wall, all of the responses came together, including those involving growth. It seems to me that, in order for that to work, for us to win once more what Ms Thyssen called the battle for trust, for hope, we must, at all costs, include in this global response, or rather ensure that this global response does indeed contain, this pillar, or this human, social and citizens’ dimension. In any case, honourable Members, it was in this belief that I returned to the Commission three years ago. It is in this belief that I am working with my colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, if we go beyond words and look closely at what I proposed to you in the Single Market Act, with your support and that of your Committee on the Internal Market, you will clearly see this balance, with several major levers devoted to social cohesion, services, public services and social entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Cercas was just talking about his blind trust in the markets. Personally, I do not have blind trust in the markets. I do not believe in market self-regulation. In the past we have been either too naive or sometimes too trusting in such self-regulation, such deregulation over the last 15 or 20 years. We are learning the lessons from that. The 28 texts I have proposed to you concerning the lessons from the crisis – as asked of us by the G20 – indeed prove that we are restoring order, governance, transparency and, quite simply, morality where these had been lost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also want to say, more specifically, that, with regard to this social dimension, we must, in the context of economic and monetary union, strengthen coordination of employment policy and social policy as a key factor in its success. You will see this concern reflected in the Europe 2020 targets, with several priorities on employment, education and social inclusion, and in the European Semester, which gives it priority importance. I also consider that, in the efforts towards budgetary rigour and budgetary stability logically demanded of many Member States, particularly in the euro area, there is a need to be highly selective in order to maintain spending under the solidarity heading and prudential spending, particularly in relation to education and research.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say to Mr Gualtieri that I agree on the need to improve such ex ante coordination of budgetary policy, which is one of the keys to economic coordination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Wortmann-Kool, Mr Strejček and, just now, Mr Zalba Bidegain referred to a banking union. I want to confirm that, in building this banking union, we are starting with the foundation stone, namely supervision, and I would remind you that other elements of this banking union have been put before you, relating to deposit guarantees and resolution of banking crises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also – I say this to Ms Wortmann-Kool – paying great attention here to proper calibration of the measures we are taking to consolidate the banks. It is one of the keys to stability. Such proper calibration is also one of the keys to banks again starting to fulfil their role, which is to finance the economy, local areas and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises. With this in mind, Mr President, I will, in the coming weeks, start a debate with you by means of a green paper on financing long-term investment in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to answer Mr Hoang Ngoc, who just criticised the Commission by saying that its decisions in some way prompted the crisis. I am not going to get into an argument with you, but in your next sentence, Mr Hoang Ngoc, you rather suggested the opposite, by saying that a banking union needs to be established, there needs to be more surveillance. That is exactly what the Commission is doing in all of its proposals. I think you must be fair with us, even if you are right to be demanding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will briefly answer several of you. To Ms Swinburne: yes, we must construct a clear and solid legal framework for a banking union. You talk about the major banks, of course, but there are also others. I would like to recall that several of the banks that caused or are currently causing problems – Northern Rock, Bankia, Dexia – do not figure among the major or very major banks. Banks that represent a risk therefore need effective supervision generally, and in the euro area in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To Mr Klinz: with regard to a banking union, I do not think that Parliament is on the sidelines, even if this idea came from the Commission and the European Council. You received an overall package, with a directive and a regulation, and you will give your opinion on that package. I am listening closely to what Parliament is saying, particularly on democratic control, and to what several of your colleagues have said – I will come back to that – on the integrity, unity and cohesion of the single market. To my mind, Parliament is not, therefore, on the sidelines. On the contrary, it has a very important opinion to give.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Ford, Mr Hökmark and Ms Herczog referred to the unity of the euro area. I would like to recall, honourable Members, that, in talking about regulation, we are talking about regulation for the 27 countries of the European Union, the single rule book, only one single rule book. That is something different, since within the euro area the Member States are more interdependent – it is clear to see – and more interdependence between the banks. There is therefore a legitimate need to strengthen surveillance and to be more efficient, more integrated and more coherent with regard to surveillance. That is what justifies this banking union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore a matter of regulation for 27 countries and of better-integrated supervision in the euro area first of all, though open to countries that are not, or not yet, members of the euro area and would like to participate. That is precisely what we are working on at present, to create the conditions for such equitable, indeed equal, involvement of countries that are not in the euro area and would like to participate in this supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to signal my agreement with Ms Goulard, who pointed out that one of the keys to credibility is to do what one says, and I consider our main task now, in relation to our citizens, is to show that we are implementing what has been decided.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Kariņš also just referred to the right way to build a house. Once again, the credibility of everything we do comes from pooling our answers, as happened on 29 June. Moreover, the great feature of the Thyssen report is that it mentions all of these dimensions. That is what I am doing with the single market dossier, and that is what Commissioner Rehn is doing with the economic governance dossier.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms in ‘t Veld just referred to something important, namely the risk of a national or nationalist retreat, which, moreover, is generally accompanied by protectionist measures. We must be very careful, also, not to let our political and economic responses allow these risks of national retreat to gain a foothold. I often say that the single market could be the first victim of national or protectionist retreat, even though it is, paradoxically, our best chance and prime trump card for exiting this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the responses that must be provided, Ms Ferreira just referred to another important matter on which Mr Tajani is working, namely the industrial policy response. That does not mean protectionist measures but rather clear and equitable management of our trade relations, as well as investment and mobilisation of our resources to re-establish or consolidate a productive base – Ms Ferreira is right – in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Lamberts referred to the federal leap. This expression does not shock me, personally. I understand the impatience, and sometimes regret, that we are not going fast and far enough, but I want to note, in fairness, that if you look at the content of the six-pack, the two-pack or the banking union, you will see not just proper involvement of Parliament, though that is right, but also steps towards more integration and pooling of policies and European destinies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Terho, quite rightly, just mentioned the initial inadequacies of the euro area, the gaps we are now filling by means of all of these governance measures. That is what Commissioner Rehn is doing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A word to Hans-Peter Martin: a banking union does interest ordinary people, honourable Members, precisely because of the work we are doing so that taxpayers, who have ultimately been called on too often to pay for the consequences of the mistakes made by some banks or bankers, of bad management, of lack of smart supervision, shortcomings in supervision and management mistakes, not to mention manipulation. That is enough now! Taxpayers must not be called on further and that is just what we are seeking to achieve through supervision, governance and resolution. All of the measures we are taking, and which I am proposing to you, are intended to avert, to prevent, crises and ensure that, when crises occur, it is the shareholders or others involved in those banks who pay, and not taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I would like to tell Mr Schmidt, Mr Hökmark, Ms Wortmann-Kool and Ms Hübner that I attach great importance to the integrity of the single market. That is why I made a clear distinction between the financial regulation we are undertaking and the method of supervising the banking sector in the euro area, a method open, however, to countries that want it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to thank Ms Thyssen for the quality of this report. You have presented an important report, which has garnered very wide support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To Mr Duff and Ms Podimata, who voted for the democratic challenge, I similarly think we must strengthen democratic control yet further and listen to national parliaments. You have a very important part to play in this regard, to forge links with national parliaments and avoid splits or cracks appearing in all of our work on integration. Mr Hoang Ngoc, you just said that, with this report, you had invited yourselves to the democratic debate. I do not think you invited yourselves. I consider that Parliament is needed in the debate on economic and monetary union. Because you are the only European institution directly elected by the people, I take the view that you are needed and that this report, Ms Thyssen, is of very great importance at this time.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I shall try to be brief. I have listened closely to all the speeches, opinions and questions put by the honourable Members of the European Parliament. I would like to mention Mr Simon’s comments on the deposit guarantee system. We recognise the role and importance of the system as one of the key elements of the single rule book which will form the basis for banking union. Discussion of this proposal is inseparably linked with the proposal on bank recovery and resolution. The Member States therefore do not consider it possible to promote the deposit guarantee system without clarifying the details of the funding for that proposal; I shall, however, certainly pass on the points you have raised to the competent minister. As regards ensuring democratic legitimacy in the decision-making process, I am convinced that there should be strong mechanisms to ensure democratic legitimacy. At the European Council in October, it was agreed that ways to ensure a proper debate in the context of the European Semester, both within the European Parliament and in national parliaments, should be explored. I would like to add that the Member States which are signatories to the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union are seeking to improve cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament. This is an area which the European Council will certainly need to return to in December. As regards the social aspect, we believe it has already been covered to a large extent by the Europe 2020 strategy, as Mr Perez and other speakers have pointed out, and that social rights are at the heart of the European Union’s values. Austerity policies take account of this element as far as possible; however, circumstances often make it necessary to take measures which are difficult to accept but must nevertheless be continued in order to restore trust. My own country is no exception. It is obviously very important that there should continue to be a robust dialogue on this issue between us, i.e. between the two institutional bodies that we represent. The deepening of economic and monetary union will call for more active involvement by all the institutional bodies, including this Parliament. You should therefore play a substantial part in this discussion. I think we all agree that an ambitious European plan must be approved at the European Council meeting in December, and that, as Ms Thyssen has put it, the new measures which are to be included in this plan must signal the start of a renewed relationship of trust. We believe this meeting is particularly useful and that it shows in practice that the European Parliament has a very substantial role to play in the entire process, on the basis of the interim evaluation of Ms Thyssen’s report. Cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council is already very close, and on many occasions Mr Van Rompuy has called on Mr Schulz to present the views of the European Parliament. The Council wants the European Parliament to be actively involved and is making every effort to strengthen its voice. I assure you that we are listening carefully to your concerns and are taking them into account in our work, while looking forward to further strengthening the cooperation between us. Thank you for this interesting discussion. I shall pass on the issues that have been raised to the Council and the President of the Council.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I wish to make another three points. I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Barnier for their positive comments about the report, but I would also at once express the hope that we shall manage to travel the route to really strengthening economic and monetary union in the same positive spirit of cooperation, because in the end actions speak louder than words.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, this report is the product of intense cooperation between many of our Members: in the first place Mr Gualtieri, the rapporteurs for the opinion of the various committees and also all shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Very many thanks indeed, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, Mr President, I should like to say something about constructive cooperation. Constructive cooperation is not only enjoyable and a good thing because it is enjoyable but above all it is good because it is proof of the fact that in this House we wish to act with determination and also that the political skills are present to roll out a vision that we share and that we wish to share across borders and over and above party and group lines.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That, ladies and gentlemen, is what our citizens expect from us. We are their representatives. We must fight for our rights in order to let their voices be heard, but above all we must come up with solutions to their problems. People do not want a never-ending game of ping pong between institutions or parties; they want us to be able to transcend differences of opinion through exchanges of views and particularly for these exchanges of views to lead to actual decisions being taken. This brings me back to where I started: actions speak louder than words and we shall all be judged on them.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a European big business plan, intended to reduce unit labour costs (the real objective behind price stability), greater liberalisation of capital movement and, consequently, greater mobility of multinational capital in search of better conditions for exploiting labour and controlling markets within the European area. The consequences of that are evident: a deterioration in living and working conditions; a fall in the wage share in national income; the destruction of manufacturing infrastructures and increased de-industrialisation in the peripheral countries – turning them into consumers of the excess produced by core countries. EMU is inevitably bound up with the increase in macroeconomic imbalances between the various countries in the euro area, indissociable from the indebtedness of the net importer States. The path proved to be unsustainable, but those who were reaping the benefit do not want to deviate from it. Therefore, in a veritable forging ahead, they wish to strengthen the instrument which served their interests so well. That is typical in the EU: each new step towards integration tries to legitimise the previous step and to justify the next one. The result is greater centralisation of political and economic power, new steps towards the development of a monopolistic capitalism on a European scale and more attacks on democracy and the sovereignty of peoples.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Union and its Member States are currently experiencing another year of enormous economic problems. The crisis triggered by the collapse of American banks in 2008 has had the greatest effect on young people. We should regard the fact that as many as 22 % of them are out of work as a personal defeat; and in some Member States the unemployment level in this age group is over 50 %. It is a paradox that the Erasmus generation – the first generation of true Europeans – is increasingly taking to referring to itself as ‘lost’. Consequently, when we are drafting recommendations aimed at the creation of a genuine economic and monetary union, we must take full advantage of all the instruments provided by the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with the rapporteur that the potential of the Lisbon Treaty in the sphere of social policy is not being fully utilised. Decisive steps should be taken to support and supplement the actions of Member States as regards integration of individuals who are excluded from the labour market, as this exclusion mainly affects young people. Studies have shown that if they do not succeed in taking up stable and fairly remunerated work within a few years of completing their education, they will remain outside the labour market for good. Instead of building a future for the EU, they will more probably constitute a source of instability and manifold problems. We should therefore do all we can to ensure that these young and often well-educated people can take full advantage of the potential inherent in them. For if we lose this generation, we shall also lose the EU and a good future for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">A common currency can be sustainable and stable only if Member States are willing to delegate their powers in the field of fiscal policy to the level of the Union. We need to create a stable framework within which Member States can rely on support which is based on solidarity with other Member States, should problems arise. On the other hand, each Member State must take responsibility for its financial stability and its behaviour in the area of fiscal policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">The current crisis has prompted a fundamental discussion about the future of Europe. This is also the only positive aspect of the crisis. The report by the four Presidents constitutes an insufficient response to this. Due to the one-sided composition of the committee, the fear is that this will only serve to prolong the problems experienced to date. The existing economic union is being supplemented by a fiscal union and a banking union. An attempt is being made to repair something that cannot be repaired in this way. Disastrous consequences could result from ‘more of the same’. Europe is suffering from two problems in particular: too little growth and employment and a lack of confidence on the part of its citizens. The only way out of this dilemma is for the economic union to become an economic and social union. Although the report recognises this problem, it cannot bring itself to make a clear commitment. We need to have the courage to safeguard the current union in a sustained way by means of a social pillar. To date this step has been taken far too hesitantly.</p>

      <p sl="it">I also firmly believe that some remedial action needs to be taken and that the Commission should have a propositional role, because sometimes it seems as though the Competitiveness Council could turn into a kind of Coreper, given the constant rotation of ministers. Sometimes Member States that are unable to send four or five ministers on the same day prefer to send a diplomatic representative. Because of the situation and because we want to overcome this crisis by focusing on the real economy, I believe that greater weight should be given to the Competitiveness Council and that the Commission should be given a bigger coordinating role, and I would like to thank Parliament for the support it has always given me on this.</p>

Of course I believe that it would be worthwhile in the current situation to revitalise the Competitiveness Council, and secondly I think that a working group should be set up within the Commission to work with Commissioner Almunia on the one hand and the Commissioner for trade on the other. While the problem with Europe’s industry is definitely a problem with Europe’s industry, at the same time it is also a problem with the rules of the internal market and with policy on external relations not being sufficiently vigilant so that all kinds of goods arrive in Europe that do not comply with our rules.</p>

Rethinking Europe’s industrial policy is therefore paramount, as we all know. This ranges from education, research and innovation to the promotion of sustainable production. Promoting innovation also means supporting young entrepreneurs – especially young female entrepreneurs – whose talents are still largely underexploited.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe also needs to invest in its infrastructure, especially regarding traffic networks, while taking into consideration national and regional specificities. To do so, Europe needs adequate funding programmes, such as Connecting Europe or the Horizon 2020 Strategy, which could play an important role and require a budget that is sufficient. Moreover, we must do our utmost to prevent the social catastrophes we witness today when it comes to industrial restructuring. To that end, fostering social dialogue is crucial.

But on the question of female entrepreneurs, there are existing EU financial instruments and programmes exist which can support women in becoming entrepreneurs. The European Social Fund can do this and has done so in a variety of ways. The Progress Microfinance Facility, which was launched two years ago but only started to function at the beginning of last year, creates this opportunity. For example, in Slovenia I recently had the opportunity to see a project supported by Progress Microfinance. This provides opportunities for women at various stages of their careers to become self-employed or entrepreneurs. We have to highlight this, because there are still about ten countries which have not taken concrete steps towards using the Progress Microfinance Facility, and there are opportunities in this area.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, we also need to look back to the 2009 initiative that launched the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors, which was modelled on the national networks in Sweden and the United Kingdom. This network is alive and kicking today in 22 countries across the European Union. Furthermore, on 15 November 2011, the Commission launched the European Network of Mentors for Women Entrepreneurs, which is active in 17 countries with around 170 entrepreneurs, and is expanding its activities in order to increase the number of women entrepreneurs. So, within the framework of Commissioner Andor’s strategy, there are also these two concrete initiatives that enable information to be shared in a proper network.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as entrepreneurship is concerned, in a few weeks’ time – before the end of this year – we will be launching a Commission initiative under the Cypriot Presidency to encourage entrepreneurship. Its purpose is to get the message across to our young people that they do not necessarily have to go and work for the civil service, the police or the armed forces, but instead they can use their own skills and talents to become entrepreneurs – obviously with help, incentives, venture capital and start-up funding and all kinds of finance – and thus shape their own futures.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is battling with a crisis. Apart from the economic crisis we also have a social crisis linked to unemployment. Industry in Europe is seeing increasingly difficult conditions for its continuing development, as we are piling ever-increasing obligations upon it. If these are obligations related to new technologies and innovation, we all applaud that. Most of the conditions imposed, however, are an increase in financial burdens. I have a fundamental question to ask about this. At present there are plans for changes to the European system of issues trading. My question is: what are these changes intended to bring about, in the knowledge that they will lead to a leakage of industry away from Europe?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, preventing offshoring is one of our main policy objectives. That is why we are launching a series of initiatives for growth – to try to make sure our businesses do not move jobs abroad but can explore new markets, including for manufacture, and still expect a financial return. Furthermore, I think that, because of the way things are, we have already set some important ambitious targets.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our entire industrial policy – the third industrial revolution that we are fighting for – is and should be the lead player in the fight against climate change. It is no accident that Jeremy Rifkin has been one of the key players in the event with which we launched this strategy for reindustrialising Europe. The ambitious targets we have to meet are a 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions, with all the initiatives we can muster, and the Commission communication on the reindustrialisation of Europe talks about sustainable construction, clean vehicles and the green economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">But it is clearly the case that the targets set have to be achievable targets. If we ask industry, at a time when there is a global agreement in place on reducing CO2 emissions, to meet targets that are impossible to meet, the risk is that these industries will start offshoring, making the climate change situation even worse. Forcing our businesses to locate outside the EU would effectively mean encouraging them not to obey our rules, because they would be manufacturing in parts of the world without strict rules on CO2 emissions, and this would amount to a very bad environment policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Asking for achievable targets therefore seems to me to be the best way of balancing a good, modern industrial policy, one that is different from industrial policy in the past, with the commitment to responsible, achievable targets in the fight against climate change in which we are all engaged.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the worst part of it for industry is the lack of continuity in regulations and the longer-term unpredictability. It is therefore important that the law that is created in Europe is stable. I also wanted to find out, Commissioner, whether you are doing anything to ensure that this stability of regulations will at least be for longer periods: 10 or 15 years. We know that investments in industry have a long investment period, and investors in industry have to know that the money they invest will be returned to them and that this will actually be utilised in future.</p>

The Commission decision that will be submitted to the Council – I hope Parliament supports this approach – is that we back a modern model of reindustrialisation.</p>
      <p sl="it">After many years of prioritising one particular part of the economy – I am talking about the financial sector – Europe, through the Commission, is now setting the target that 20 % of GDP should come from the real economy by 2020. This is already a political and legal certainty because it is contained in an official text of the European Commission. Furthermore, I believe that an important message as far as legal certainty is concerned, and therefore a guarantee for anyone wanting to invest, is the directive on late payments by public administrations, which was passed thanks to Parliament’s strong commitment and which will enter into force in all Member States by March 2013 at the latest. Three countries – Cyprus, Malta and Italy – have already transposed it. This decisive action that the European institutions wanted to take also sends a political and legal message that in my opinion will encourage European and non-European investment in the industrial and entrepreneurial sector.</p>

      <p sl="it">Commissioner, I really appreciate the job you are doing with your colleague, Commissioner Andor. I do believe, and have done for some time, that it is very important to defend the system of production of goods and services in this part of the world. It is part of our history and identity. We obviously need to think about a modern production structure and the selective reindustrialisation of a few industries, since there are some that we clearly cannot go back to.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, if we are to revive industrial activity, it is really important for work to be done on infrastructure, which in some Member States is particularly lacking. I am thinking here of bigger infrastructure – roads, airports and railways – but I also mean systems for the production and use of energy, which for many modern industries counts for so much. I would also like to see a direct commitment to knowledge, because this is where innovation comes from, from how much we invest in knowledge, research and innovation. I think these are the most important areas and I would like to know your thoughts on this.</p>

      <p sl="it">I quite agree with your analysis and approach, Mr Cofferati. That is why the European Commission responded so positively to the letter it received from several Nobel prize winners asking the Council – on the eve of an important meeting on the next Financial Perspective – not to cut investment in research and innovation. The European Commission proposed an increase from the current 54 billion euros to – I sincerely hope – 80 billion euros, to make our entrepreneurial system more competitive globally, by backing a few specific sectors and also using applied research in industry more than is the case at present, which is of particular benefit to our competitors.</p>
      <p sl="it">The sectors to which you refer, which are listed in our proposal on the reindustrialisation of the European Union, are the sectors in which Europe wants to win on quality, and they lie at the centre of the mosaic of European reindustrialisation. From these sectors – I am thinking of clean vehicles and sustainable construction, as well as biotechnology and smart grids, and therefore of the infrastructure you were referring to – all the others can benefit: if the car industry and the construction industry are doing well, the steel industry will benefit from this, because these two sectors are some of its main customers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course infrastructure is very important. In the context of the next budget – I am sure Parliament will be with the Commission on this – we must make sure that EU investment in the infrastructure sector – thinking particularly of smart grids – is not reduced because incorrect valuations have been made. This would be damaging for our entire economic policy and for the extensive action being taken in favour of growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why the debate beginning in the Council in a few days’ time is extraordinarily important. I think the roles of both Parliament and the Commission are very important for ensuring that the EU budget is not reduced, not for the benefit of the institutions but for the benefit of citizens, who need a real economy and a market economy that can genuinely fulfil a social function.</p>

As far as infrastructure is concerned, and also a few intangibles, it is very important that we try and link up the policies within your remit with policies on the internal market. One of the items on today’s agenda – investment that comes from public procurement contracts – could become an important springboard for other spin-off activities to be developed that give weight, value and substance to industry.</p>

      <p sl="it">I quite agree with you, Mr Cofferati. As regards energy policy, I am working very closely with Commissioner Oettinger, because we realise that you cannot have a decent industrial policy without a decent energy policy. We support the idea of a single market in energy, which we realise should cut costs. You and I are both Italian and we both know that energy prices in Italy are 200 % higher than in China, which gives a stark demonstration of how difficult it is to compete outside the EU. It is difficult enough to compete inside the EU, let alone outside it.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore fundamentally important that we have a decent energy policy, just as it is to have a decent infrastructure policy. We are working on this but we need the support of the European Parliament because the two EU institutions together can certainly give impetus to meeting the targets on which we believe the success of a good growth policy depends.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission’s latest survey on economic recovery in industry shows that since 2008 almost 10% of jobs in the manufacturing industry have been lost. Last year industrial production was 3% lower than the year before. However, there is some good news as the value of exports went up last year. But at the same time we know that our industrial base is changing. This requires companies to change their business models, and workers to change their skills and become more flexible and it also requires governments to make their regulations and policies much more modern and to display a clear vision.</p>
      <p sl="en">My question is therefore twofold. How can the Commission help in a very tangible way to create a context in which markets will rejuvenate and modernise existing industries and, at the same time, allow the process of creative destruction to go ahead, do its work and create new niche markets? I think that additional tools have to be found to make additional finance for R&amp;D available and also to bring this R&amp;D into the market and bridge the value of that for new products. Also regarding workers’ skills, I think the Commission should really push forward to ensure that Member States implement new policies to ensure that workers acquire the new skills needed for new industries.</p>

Unfortunately in the last few years we have had a too-deep and too-long recession in quite a few Member States, and we are still looking for what I would prefer to call ‘creative recovery’. But it is true that the economy is a dynamic system, especially at a time of global competition. We also have to face industrial transformation. Skills and human capital play a decisive role in that. Yesterday I had an opportunity to look at a centre in Portugal where there is ongoing modernisation of vocational training. Especially in countries which have to make a great effort to revive their competitiveness and take steps forward for reindustrialisation, this is a crucial issue. This is why it is very important to see how EU instruments like the European Social Fund can support the modernisation of vocational training and the development of skills. Of course it is very important to identify what skills exactly are being taught in such centres. Here we have to use our contacts with social partners and all other stakeholders, because direct contact with industry – but also contact between the workers’ organisations and the training centres – can help develop the content and the approach in a forward-looking manner.</p>

Our document does in fact propose a third industrial revolution, an industrial revolution based on energy efficiency and promotion of the green economy, with the aim of achieving a green economy through a greener economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">When we talk about sectors that need to be supported and the sectors we should focus on for the growth of a European industrial policy, we are talking about the sustainable construction sector, as I have said, the green transport sector, the automotive sector, shipbuilding and the rail sector. When I say that we need to work on improving the raw materials sector, and we are focusing on research, as you know an EU Innovation Partnership has been launched, as Mr Bütikofer from your group knows.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are working very hard in the raw materials, recycling, replacement and extraction sector. I would say that the main objective of our entire industrial policy is to combat climate change. I have not had time to talk about it at any length, partly because time is short, but if you read our document carefully, you will undoubtedly find the answer to your comments. I say it again: construction, including our communication on the action plan for the construction sector, is all based on this same thing. All our action regarding policy for the car industry is along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact that we have given advance notice of the European policy U-turn in favour of an industrial policy does not mean we are re-hashing the ideas of the 1970s and 1980s with their out-of-date, obsolete industrial model unsuited to delivering growth and development; it means we have made an important change.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact that we have brought in as our special guest Jeremy Rifkin, whose theories are along the lines I have just explained, is no accident.

That is why it is very important to mention that the Commission’s April 2012 employment package did not handle the green economy marginally, it handled it very centrally, because it identified the green sector as one of the three key areas where job growth should be anticipated and investment in human capital should be focused.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is, of course, an important point in the current programming phase of the forthcoming seven-year financial framework between the Commission and the Member States. We trust that green skills will be prioritised in the broader concept of skills development and investment in human capital.

Twenty years ago, in his speech at Davos, Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, said that only the processing industry provides solid employment on a proper scale, while the service sector can survive only as long as there is an industry that may be supported by these services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is becoming increasingly evident that Europe’s main problem is a leakage of industry away to other countries and regions of the world. We should not deceive ourselves: until such time as we rebuild an industrial sector on our continent, we shall not manage to rid ourselves of the main causes of stagnation in the European economy. It was more than two years ago that Mario Monti said that the EU was in need of a new industrial policy that stimulated the economy. Once again, though, it has all gone no further than words and documents.</p>

I think the point is that there are quite a few EU Member States where very focused industrial policies have been successful in retaining industry, in retaining competitiveness through cooperation with the social partners through very focused investment and the coordination of policies of innovation, markets, human capital and whatever else is needed.

Instead I think we should be encouraging a few areas of industrial policy: innovation and, in the car industry, research linked for example to hybrid, electric or hydrogen-fuelled vehicles. These are positive, legitimate choices. Meanwhile, we need to avoid using unlawful State aid because it could distort the internal market and not really do anything to help competitiveness, though I do believe that there could be fiscal measures to support consumers – this would be lawful.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do think, however, that the greater effort being made not only through the current framework programme, the forthcoming Financial Perspective and Horizon 2020, but also through all the structural funds, also within the framework of the forthcoming Financial Perspective, should act as a much greater incentive to research and innovation. We might also be able to provide more help if we achieve fiscal harmonisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should definitely invest in infrastructure and we should invest in research and innovation, but without indiscriminate showers of State aid that, in the past, have only provided a temporary solution and have often created tensions between different Member States. What does work is investing in industrial policy, with a particular focus on research and innovation and helping consumers to buy the most up-to-date, most environmentally friendly products that have the greatest impact on climate change.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to address my supplementary question to both of you, although I have the impression that really this question, and it is a simple question, should be addressed to the whole Commission. Many talented people, and particularly young talented people, talented Europeans, travel outside Europe to spread their wings – to the United States, and to China. What does the European Commission intend to do to keep these talented people in Europe, to see that Europe ends up being a continent which is a leader in innovation, a leader in new technologies, and a leader in interesting initiatives?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the answer lies in the new model for Horizon 2020, in which innovation and research are aimed at industry: applying the results of research to industry – there was the famous ‘valley of death’ in the key enabling technologies sector, which caused a massive brain drain – and promoting the system of clusters, which will link up more and more universities – the research arena – with industry and small and medium-sized enterprises. We are planning to invest in this sector and, from an educational point of view, to train workers who are able to work in the clusters. I think these two decisions will help to solve – though perhaps not entirely – the problem of the best young brains in Europe leaving for non-EU .</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, on 10 October you presented the communication entitled ‘A Stronger European Industry for Growth and Economic Recovery’. As that document states, and as you have said several times today, we are talking about the third industrial revolution.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is good news, given the need for Europe to have a competitive industrial sector that is capable of creating growth, sustainability and employment and you have a great deal to do and say in relation to this, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="es">Given that this week the financial perspective 2014-2020 is going to be negotiated, my question is: what specific measures does the Commission intend to adopt in order to mobilise the investment that Europe’s manufacturing industry desperately needs right now?</p>

      <p sl="en">As you know, the European budget is an investment budget. The size and structure of the EU budget speaks volumes about the investment capacity of the forthcoming period. That is why the Commission put forward an MFF, which is a robust set of financial instruments to support various ways of investing, whether in infrastructure, research and development or human capital. We have also put forward new innovative ways of financing investment in the European Union, for example the concept of project bonds.</p>
      <p sl="en">So it is true that, in the forthcoming European Council, discussion of the MFF will be crucial. We very much hope that the arguments that the Commission has put forward for investment in all these areas will be heard and that these key elements will help restore growth potential, including in the less developed areas of the European Union, through decent allocations of cohesion policy. I think this is absolutely vital. We have to see not only the link between the Europe 2020 objectives and the MFF which the Commission originally established, but also the impact of the crisis and the fact that Europe has become more polarised. The regions hit by a long-lasting recession probably need more support in terms of infrastructure development as well as human capital and, in general terms, to help restore their competitiveness. I believe that the financial instruments in the MFF – particularly the structural funds – will be able to do this, but this will only happen if the allocations are not reduced as compared to the Commission proposal.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that the multiannual financial framework might be robust, but it might be robust with reductions; considerable reductions that are being announced and could wreck this budget. It is a complex issue, so much so that I will ask you a specific question: what budget items are planned in order to boost industry? Is there going to be a convergence fund for research and development and innovation? How are small and medium-sized enterprises going to be given help with accessing credit, as it has fallen by 22 percentage points in the past year?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-111-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, there are two particularly key headings in the next Financial Perspective. One of these, as we have said, is Horizon 2020, in which there will be a lot of investment, this time aimed at research applied to industry, since we believe innovation is the key element, although every section of the budget talks about innovation. Following that, something of great importance is small and medium-sized enterprises. The political message – and I would like to thank Parliament for the support it has given to me personally and the European Commission – is the COSME Programme. This commits 2.5 billion euros to the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises – including for the internationalisation of these businesses – for venture capital and the tourism sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">So these are the two instruments, obviously on top of what can be done with the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Funds and the European Social Fund. Commissioner Hahn has on a number of occasions emphasised the strength of his commitment to helping small and medium-sized enterprises, including with the forthcoming Financial Perspective. So we can safely say that our action to provide help for our industrial and enterprise policy is spread across the whole budget. When we talk about industrial policy, we are obviously not just talking about major manufacturing industry but also about small and medium-sized enterprises. Anyway, the two most important headings are the 80 billion for Horizon 2020 and the 2.5 billion for COSME.</p>
      <p sl="it">We could also mention the funds destined for the GALILEO project which, despite the fact that it constitutes major infrastructure, is an industrial policy project that has helped to put our space industry at the cutting edge. As you know, we launched two more satellites in October. All the calls for tender to make the satellites are complete, and these satellites will also allow entrepreneurial and industrial activities to develop because of the services they can provide on the ground. So if we look carefully and in detail at the budget put forward for the Financial Perspective 2014-2020, there is plenty in there for industrial policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I mentioned the first two of the most important headings, but there are other examples, including agricultural policy, where industry and enterprise in the agricultural sector can be helped. So I would say that, both with the Europe 2020 strategy and with the latest document on industrial policy, there has been a change, which will inevitably be converted from theory to practice through the budget. From this point of view, we are determined and, with Parliament’s support, I think we should see some positive results.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioners, recently two of the largest Greek companies announced their intention to relocate their registered offices, one to Luxembourg and the other to Switzerland. This is one step short of relocating their production units, and there is information that other Greek companies are to move their registered offices and production units. You know the prevailing situation in terms of wage cuts and labour relations in Greece. The companies themselves that are leaving say they are leaving because there is limited demand in Greece; they say investment plans are withdrawing from southern Europe because of the risk which is due mainly to European policies.</p>
      <p sl="el">So I would like to ask you, Commissioners, how do you explain the departure of companies from Greece and the South while wages are shrinking? How do you explain the fact that the risk is due to European policies?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-113-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">As you know, Mr Chountis, I have visited your country twice – once three weeks ago and the other time before the election, when Mr Papadimos was Prime Minister – and I tried to tell the Greek people that our policies for tackling the crisis are not just about sacrifice, because sacrifice without a growth policy and without initiatives to support businesses is likely to be useless and, in my opinion, harmful too, because it does not deliver the desired effect.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course we need to put our finances in order, but at the same time we should be explaining to citizens what their sacrifices are trying to achieve. That is why the European Commission and the Greek Government held a big event in Greece on the development of small and medium-sized enterprises; that is why it will be in Greece again in January organising business-to-business meetings between European businesses and Greek businesses, so as to increase European investment in Greece and to support small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are working closely with the Greek Government on the tourism sector, which falls within my area of competence and I think is tremendously important, and which should increasingly become an industry in its own right. We will be doing everything we need to do in this area. With Commissioner Damanaki, we launched an initiative just a few weeks ago in Athens. So everything that can and should be done on this will be done. In answer to your question, I do not think Europe should just be asking people to make sacrifices; I think it should also come up with a policy for growth. That is what we are trying to do, not least on the basis of the Council decision.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is not just the fiscal compact, but also a growth policy, which must be sustained and developed, focusing on the different entrepreneurial situations that create employment in the different Member States. As far as I am concerned, my commitment to the Greek economic fabric will be very strong; I consider it a priority. Because Greece cannot and should not be abandoned, but should remain in the EU and in the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I am sorry but you have answered a different question and, forgive me, we have had enough of such answers. I asked you something different: there is the argument that Greece must become competitive and reduce its labour costs; however, the reduction in labour costs is not preventing companies from relocating outside Greece. So the problem is, are you saying this as an explanation? Or is it the other way round, are you saying that this is how things should be done? And a second, supplementary question: should Greece follow sectoral policies in industry in order to tackle the employment problem?</p>

      <p sl="en">I think it is true what you said in the first half of your question about the importance of demand. Of course, nowadays it has to be interpreted in the whole European context and not just in the national context of individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we have a single market and we even want to deepen it further, then demand-side policies should be developed on the entire EU level. Greece unfortunately is a very specific case because of the high indebtedness and the fact that it was not so transparent in the past years. It required external assistance and now it is not only the troika but also the EU Task Force which is working very hard to provide assistance to generate investment and by using the EU structural funds faster and with better focus to help promote reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">These and many other elements – which the Vice-President also referred to – should add up to improved competitiveness and a better investment climate. Now of course a better investment climate would also require social peace and better harmony. That should, of course, be promoted through a better dialogue between the stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me just point to one fact which was coming through two weeks ago in the projections of our colleague Vice-President Olli Rehn, which was a very realistic projection for the next year end and for the one after on the European Union’s economy. But interestingly in the case of Greece there was a silver lining in the form of reducing unemployment. I very much hope that this is linked to a judgment that competitiveness is improving and the operation of all these stakeholders which are listed is now hopefully bearing fruit.</p>

One of these is the Connecting Europe Facility. It is one of many. It is important for infrastructure in transport, energy and telecommunications. Not only will it have an impact on businesses, it also helps complete the single market and it helps lever in private sector money.</p>

I would remind you that Europe is the principal global aid donor and that we could at least receive the President of the Republic of Haiti in courteous fashion. I truly regret that you have changed the agenda.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, President Martelly, relations between the European Union and Haiti are particularly important to us. The severe earthquake that shook Haiti on 12 January 2010, claiming the lives of more than 220 000 people and making 1.7 million people homeless, prompted an unprecedented level of international solidarity, particularly on the part of Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The EU provided extensive humanitarian assistance and development aid to help with the reconstruction of your country. Since 2010 the European Union has been the main provider of aid to Haiti. While your country was still contending with the disastrous consequences of the earthquake, it was ravaged once again by natural disasters this year. Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy once more brought death and destruction to the country, with devastating consequences in terms of providing for the population.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">President Martelly, our House has always pushed for the EU to make a strong commitment to Haiti and for close cooperation with the Haitian authorities. We want to help your country. We want to help it become an economically and politically stable country, a country that can look after itself and can make a contribution itself to reducing poverty permanently.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Our hope is that your Presidency will lead to the establishment of a lasting, stable democracy and stability in Haiti. Enormous challenges lie ahead of you, President Martelly. Believe us, we know about the drama of the challenges you are facing – as yesterday’s discussion in the committees of Parliament demonstrated.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Three years after the disaster 370 000 people in the country are still waiting for permanent accommodation that is fit for habitation. As some of them are having to live in abject conditions, efforts to provide them with accommodation are of the utmost importance. The reconstruction process naturally needs to be organised as efficiently as possible. Poverty in the country must be fought by all possible means and the reforms needed to ensure that democracy and the rule of law can be strengthened as required must be tackled – particularly within the judicial system.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In relation to the debate about the funding of the European Union, I would like to add that we need to ensure that we remain able to fulfil our international commitments. With regard to your country in particular we must deliver on our promises and continue to support the citizens of Haiti in a spirit of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the European Parliament you have a reliable partner alongside you as you undertake the necessary implementation of your ambitious reform programme. However, this Parliament will also fight to secure the funds that the European Union needs to keep the promises it has made to countries such as Haiti. The fight to achieve an ambitious European budget is therefore also a fight to be able to guarantee that we can keep our promises in the area of solidarity.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I am now delighted to give you the floor, President Martelly, and would like to welcome you again to the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I acknowledge the honour you do my country in welcoming me here to the prestigious Strasbourg Parliament. I would like to thank you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I come bearing our credo, the same one you had in adversity; the one that gave you three decades of prosperity; the one that got you back on your feet after the Second World War; the one that brought down the Berlin Wall; the one that motivated the greatly respected Paul-Henri Spaak.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I came here to tell you that, come hell or high water, and despite its bruises, Haiti has not lowered its guard. Slowly but surely, Haiti is standing up again, and that is the good news I come to share with you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While we owe this change of tack to the courage of our people and the determination of our government, we certainly also include the active cooperation on the part of Europe, the most important cooperation of all. I would like to thank you. I see in it the signs of a friendship forged by history, a friendship that certainly cannot leave us indifferent to the financial crisis which, in threatening you, also affects us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I remain convinced that a united, and thus even stronger, Europe will be able to find the right solutions to re-launch its economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I remain convinced that no recession lasts forever. The length of a crisis depends on the speed and wisdom of the recovery measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From Mario Draghi to Christine Lagarde, to mention but those two, you have access to some of the best brains on the planet, which will enable you to arrest this crisis and put it right.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, my presence here serves first of all to thank you for your generosity and solidarity and to recall that no country can recover from poverty by simple handouts and charity.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">True, Haiti still needs aid. However, first and foremost, Haitians need productive work, trade and direct investment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Haiti is at the gates of the Americas: North America, which is starting to grow again, and South America, which has not returned to crisis this time and has never stopped growing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Haiti is a strategic platform, a hub, investment friendly, a jump-off point enabling European undertakings to participate in reconstructing the country and gain a strategic outpost for the region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Haiti needs ports, airports, roads, power stations and hotels. Haiti has fertile soil and is easily able to start feeding its citizens again and exporting its surpluses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Haiti’s climate and geography are unequalled, with thousands of miles of white sandy beaches and nature still largely virgin and unexplored.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From Fort Liberté, to Cayes, from Gonaïves to Miragoâne, our country has abundant naturally protected deep-water harbours.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our citizens are young, courageous, welcoming and hardworking. I am here today to present this country to you, to invite and encourage you to take advantage of the best of the country and its extraordinary investment opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I invite you to work with us to help us regain our financial sovereignty by making it possible for us to return to the international financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am here to consider, with you, other potential free trade agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I encourage you to work with us to design and develop smart, profitable projects. I ask you to collaborate with us so that, together, we find the best ways of financing them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of your retired teachers dream only of helping to make our world a fairer and more equitable place. Send them to us and share in training our young people and their teachers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Join us in changing history: history that reminds us of our links with Spain, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Poland; more recent history that recalls the trade links we had, until 1940, with Germany; history that will record what the European Union is doing now in the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, in terms of development cooperation efforts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe can be proud of its place in the world: its charisma, its convictions, the schools of thought it carries, the answers it brings to the planet’s problems, its initiatives and its role in emerging countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European young people must know that the countries of the South are counting on them, that they cannot shut themselves off and that their generosity and intelligent choices will lead to a world which is more based on comradeship, more economically moral, more environmentally secure, and certainly more democratic and more tolerant.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Haiti today, made strong by this friendship, is taking action, sweeping away all of the old clichés attached to it, breaking the chains of endemic underdevelopment, exorcising its old demons, combating the desertification that threatens it and seeking to open up to the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For a year and a half now, my administration has been working hard on this. There have been a few hiccups from time to time but nobody will deny our good faith.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Again this year Haiti was hit, with varying intensity, by tropical storms Isaac and Sandy, which tested us. Once again, it was human lives, harvests, homes and livestock that suffered and once again, the international community was quick to come to our aid, to rescue and to rebuild.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One day this vicious circle must be broken and a virtuous circle constructed. That is what we are doing; it is by making this effort that Haiti will get back on its feet. Haiti will get back on its feet because we have understood that the vulnerability of Haitian land, already considerable, will increase in the coming years in pace with the progress of climate change predicted for the Caribbean.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It will get back on its feet because, stubbornly, we are working to get to grips with another timescale, that of prevention, which, in this area, means land use planning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Land use planning means making the country less vulnerable, protecting watersheds so that they stop causing destruction as a result of deforestation, erosion or anarchic urbanisation. Land use planning also means not losing millions of dollars every time there is a major weather event and creating an acceptable living environment for the Haitian people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My government has instruments to start making land use planning a reality. These instruments are CNIGS (National Centre for Geo-spatial Information), supported by you, the European Union, and CIAT (Inter-ministerial Committee on Land Use Planning), to which you contribute. I would like to thank you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want you to know that my administration will make thorough use of these to frame its action over time and to make an impact in the Haitian context.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You see, in this area, Europe, the ‘old continent’ is ahead of not a few other partners. As we say in Haiti: Europe ‘pran devant ’, or ‘Europe is at the forefront’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe continues to inspire a rapidly changing world, where, increasingly, the idea of States going it alone must give way to regionalisation, creating a space for free movement of goods and persons, multiple states speaking with a single voice and supporting each other while retaining their identity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Caribbean region, involving all of the Caribbean islands, large and small, with no exceptions, may one day emerge as a genuine union of independent States and take full advantage of its extraordinary geostrategic position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not just the price to be paid for stability – I was going to say for peace in the world – but much more: these are the new development incentives in a context where all those involved undertake to maintain peace, lawfulness and justice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union makes its contribution here, in the context of its support for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and the funds allocated under the European Development Fund to regional integration are becoming more substantial and playing a part in this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today’s Haiti supports that, conscious of its position, its weight and its role in the region, but also of its shortcomings. We have clear-sightedly evaluated where we lag behind and have decided to stop engaging in self-flagellation but rather to work to rectify the shortcomings. We are doing so, a little more each day. It will not be a sprint but a marathon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here, too, Europe inspires us since, while some of its Member States were on their knees scarcely half a century ago, they are now, despite the financial crisis, again on solid foundations that will enable them to get back on their feet one day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe getting back on its feet rests, among other things, on the transparent management and rational use of public resources, the unequivocal functioning of justice, the level of education of its peoples and their desire to work unceasingly to rebuild their respective economies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Success knows no borders. My term of office is dedicated, among other things, to schooling our population, fighting corruption and establishing the rule of law, and I anticipate that the results will come.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Already, in less than two years, more than a million children, hitherto left out of the equation, have been brought free of charge into the education system, with no help other than from the public purse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Already the effort to get back on our feet has also resulted in more than a million homeless people being re-housed, justifying another effort made by your taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to express my great gratitude to them and assure them that their solidarity has not been plundered and that the most vulnerable have been its true beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Already our hoped-for rule of law is taking shape: the vacancies in our institutions have been filled; the amended Constitution, despite its weaknesses, has been promulgated; the judiciary has found its feet; the Superior Council of the Judiciary is operating; the Permanent Electoral Council is being assembled; elections to renew a third of the Senate are on the way; civil liberties are in place and the press expresses itself freely, the opposition even more so; corruption is losing ground and there is now no refuge for organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Slowly but surely justice is becoming more just!</p>
      <p sl="fr">On human rights, I am actively working towards ratification, during my term of office, of agreements and conventions to remove the statute of limitations for certain crimes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Just as, in the same vein, during my term of office and with your cooperation, the right to health, work, equal opportunities, gender equality and protection of minors will become a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The initial signs are there!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic Europe was what came first; the founding fathers of the EEC understood that, the ACP countries must understand it too. Haiti, above all!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your cooperation pushes in that direction by supporting major infrastructure works in our country. National Road No 3, a large section of which was recently opened in the presence of Commissioner Piebalgs, is a telling sign. The road will enable, indeed already allows, the local economies of this region to become more dynamic, and they are grateful to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Plants for processing raw materials at the borders with our neighbours, border customs points and access routes to the bi-national markets also point in the direction of economic development first of all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, from the very start of my term of office, I have been preaching these models and others besides: those often drawn from the wells of your wisdom, your ideals, your old civilisation; those which emanate from Strasbourg, now closely associated with the democratic ideals of your Parliament; those on the basis of which you support us; those in the name of which you have so warmly welcomed me here today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the Brussels I Regulation was undoubtedly one of the most successful pieces of EU legislation in that it laid the foundations for a European judicial area and promoted legal certainty for European citizens. The recast of this Regulation affects fundamental areas for the development of European justice, including the extension of the jurisdiction rules to disputes involving defendants domiciled in third countries and choice-of-court agreements. I believe that adopting the new Regulation will guarantee more robust protection for consumers and provide greater legal certainty within the internal market, and that is why I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I voted in favour of the report because the free circulation of judgments is an objective which is vital for the consolidation of the European Union. I believe that this motion will remove the obstacles to the process of recognising and enforcing judgments in civil and commercial matters in another Member State. Extending the provisions to citizens of third countries who are inside the Union is also very important.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, the introduction of choice-of-court agreements will make judicial proceedings more efficient. This means that the court chosen by the parties to settle a dispute will always have priority. This will simplify proceedings and reduce costs. We must give citizens and companies within the Union the opportunity to settle their disputes as swiftly and efficiently as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Court of Human Rights has decided in numerous cases that the right of access to a court would be illusory if a contracting state’s domestic legal system allowed for a final binding judgement to remain on paper and not be enforced to the detriment of one party.</p>
      <p sl="en">The right of execution of a judgement derives from the essential principle of the rule of law. We need to unify the rules on the conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters in all EU Member States. The exequatur for all civil and commercial judgements must be abolished. This will be a significant step forward in access to justice for citizens and businesses. The measure will simplify the procedure which allows a claimant who has obtained a judgement from a Member State to enforce that judgement in any other Member State. This would be totally to the benefit of our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as you will know, the United Kingdom has given notice that it intends to opt out of most of the justice and home affairs issues controlled currently by the European Union. If anybody does not understand why, let me introduce you to a young man called Andrew Symeou whom I visited in Athens a couple of years ago when he was detained under house arrest, who was a victim of what was very obviously a case of mistaken identity, as was established when the case finally came to court and was thrown out almost immediately. But in the meantime, this young man, who had gone to Greece celebrating his A-Level exams, had lost three years of his life, 11 months of them spent in one of the most unpleasant prisons in Europe. How do you give that back to a boy of that age? We complain about the length of detention – there was a great row in Britain about 42 days being too long. He was three years without the case so much as coming to trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">My country’s greatest gift to the human race, our supreme export, was the concept of the rule of law and habeas corpus and the freedom of the individual and all of the things that go with the conception of the law being above the government rather than a projection of the wishes of the state. This is not some abstract issue of sovereignty: this is about the law being a protector of the individual and not an instrument of the government.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, we all know how important it is to guarantee the safety of citizens within the Member States. The proposal in question, on which I voted in favour, seeks to reduce the frequency and impact of terrorist attacks by limiting access by the general public to widely used substances which in high concentrations can also be used to manufacture explosives. I consider the introduction of a duty to report suspicious transactions of these substances to be very worthwhile, while I note that the tonnages concerned by the proposal, which is directed at wholesalers, retailers and Member States, are small compared to the total amounts sold.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I voted in favour of this report. When what we have in the balance is people’s safety on the one hand and individual freedoms on the other, the situation must be evaluated in the light of the acceptability of the objectives and the principle of proportionality.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Even though the basic approach of the report is to restrict individual rights and increase state control, what we have here is an important legislative proposal by which it will be possible to prevent individual terrorist attacks in the future. Nor, probably, will it be difficult to justify the acceptability of such an objective to the general public. From the aspect of effective prevention of terrorism, it is important that the Member States comply with common statutory provisions which are also effectively carried out in practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I voted for the report on the marketing and use of explosives precursors. It follows and supports the Commission’s approach in restricting access by the general public to 15 high-risk chemicals in concentrations that can be used for the manufacture of home-made explosives. The free movement of goods will not suffer from this measure.</p>
      <p sl="en">For instance, eight substances listed in Annex I may continue to be sold in concentrated form but only if the buyer presents a licence granted by a national competent authority. The sale of other substances would remain restriction-free but be better controlled. Wholesalers and retailers would be obliged to report any suspicious transactions. I also welcome the decision to support the Commission’s approach involving setting up a more harmonised licensing system instead of a dual system as proposed by the Council. By limiting access by the general public to these 15 substances, the regulation should reduce the frequency and impact of terrorist attacks.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, of course the explosion that everyone is expecting now is a monetary one. Journalists and observers love to portray things in dramatic terms, so we are given a choice between solving the euro crisis or some blast that will explode it. There is, of course, a third – and, it seems to me, likelier – option, which is that we just carry on getting gradually poorer, as most of our constituents have been doing these past two or three years. We are condemning people to wretchedness and squalor and emigration because we are not allowing countries to price their way back into the market and adjust their monetary policy to their own needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The real explosion that we risk is not one of the financial system but one of our democratic system, when people find that it does not matter how they vote because the decisions that most tangibly impact their lives come from remote Brussels institutions. That might be an explosion which is not controllable but which blasts the entire European system of representative government to sparks and splinters.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, with this report Parliament is recognising how quickly the consumer credit market is changing. The financial crisis is also a credit crisis and the massive reduction in loans granted to families affects businesses and the whole economy. If the Commission could intervene to increase access to cross-border credit, which is currently too low, accounting for only 2 % of total credit in the EU, many Europeans who are currently unable to obtain loans in their own countries because of the economic problems of those countries could obtain them in other Member States, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of the single market for which the European institutions are fighting so hard to overcome national boundaries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I support this agreement between the European Parliament and the Council. As a fully functioning market economy we need to open up national markets in the economic sector of consumer credit. Accomplishing this will promote competition, eliminate market distortions between operators and improve the functioning of the internal market. However, statistics show that cross-border consumer credit has not increased in years. Some legal and practical barriers still remain.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am supporting this proposal to further harmonise and improve the consumption of consumer credit. It is very important in terms of strengthening the internal market in the area of consumer credit with regard to cross-border transactions. In addition, it includes a high level of consumer credit protection, which is extremely important in order to promote confidence in purchasing consumer credit. Thus, economic growth and investment greatly depend on the adoption of this directive.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Jazłowiecka’s report, which lets us take an important step forward in the current debate on the economic recovery of individual Member States. While balancing the Member States’ budgets is a priority on the one hand, targeted social investment is also needed to prepare individuals, families and businesses for the change of economic climate and the demands of the employment market. As well as the sustainability of public finances, the Member States should also be focusing on how to create sustainable, quality jobs, on how to invest in training and updating of skills, and on fighting poverty and social exclusion. Hence the need for, and perhaps urgency of, a coordinated approach to social investment and therefore a Social Investment Pact for the whole of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I voted in favour of this important report. Ensuring European competitiveness in the future will require the commitment of social investments, particularly now during this time of financial crisis. When correctly implemented, social investments increase employment and the well-being of citizens. For this reason, they should not be seen merely as expenses but rather as investments in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">What is particularly important is to invest in measures to promote employment. Both young people and the long-term unemployed need support as they move into working life. In addition, attention needs to be paid to the quality of working life, and to how people cope with work-related stress. In my opinion, the idea of an agreement on social investment is highly welcome.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, last Friday in Dublin I had the honour of launching a Leonardo da Vinci-funded training project called Motives. The Motives project promotes the wider social returns of workers involved in training and retraining, and the project has developed a tool for measuring the return on social investment or ROSI. The social investment approach taken by the Ballymun Centre is, I believe, one that should be more widely replicated across Europe in the years ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fiscal consolidation on its own will not end the crisis and will only work if combined with growth. Enlightened social investment policies make a tangible difference not only in raising employment levels but also in promoting high-skilled quality jobs. Social investment policies will help to prepare people for change rather than just trying to repair the damage after the event.</p>

This report calls on Member States to arrange for a system of investment, education and employment targets in coordination with the EU 2020 goals. The Social Investment Pact will contain enforcement mechanisms to ensure that each nation is meeting its goals and to stimulate economic growth. The current unemployment rate in the EU’s 27 Member States is now above 10 %, up from 7.1 % in 2008. Youth unemployment is far worse: it is currently over 20 %.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Slovakia has had very bad experience in the past with the implementation of social investment. Owing to high costs, a lack of transparency in the allocation of subsidies and unclear outcomes, social enterprises have become synonymous with the ineffective waste of public funds. Each of us is concerned about high unemployment, particularly among young people. However, that does not mean that it is necessary to begin to spend billions of euros to give people work, the outcomes of which will be of no interest. If by chance there is interest, this will only be because they will be competing in price terms with functioning businesses thanks to subsidies. Such distortion of the labour market does not solve problems – it creates them. The state is unable to judge which business plan is good and which is not. We learned this during the communist era.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the changing economic situation and the battle with the economic crisis are giving rise to a need for changes in the European labour market and in education systems. The European Union should draw up a plan for social investment, or targeted actions aimed at activation of European society, consisting in investment in individuals and individual families and social groups. This is why, in the report adopted today, of which I am author, I am inciting Member States to sign what is called a social investment pact, which will promote, among other things, investment in lifelong education, cooperation between business and schools and occupational excellence in the workplace, and special training in sectors affected by a shortage of workers. Social investment should be aimed at instilling enterprise and self-reliance, which as a result of certain aspects of social policy are currently dormant, in us right from pre-school age. To this end I voted for this report, and it was also to this end that I drew it up, and from here I would like once again to thank all my colleagues who worked with me on it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I had some grave concerns about the original proposals contained in these reports. The Commission’s original plans were going to require off-road farm bikes used in the agricultural industry and the forestry industry to be built to the same specification as on-road bicycles or quads, as you would call them. That would have had disastrous consequences for the safety and the stability of farm quads. They would be less stable on steep ground, more likely to tip over and indeed they would be unable to perform the day-to-day functions which are necessary when used by farmers and indeed foresters. It would also have dramatically increased the costs of the bikes. Common sense has prevailed, though, and off-road bikes will now be built to a separate specification from on-road bikes, recognising that they are used in dramatically different types of terrain. These changes reflect Parliament’s willingness to listen to and act on the genuine concerns of our citizens about the contents of the proposals and rather than turning a deaf ear to them, they have amended them and that is why I voted for them today.</p>

In particular, partly because they safeguard manufacturers’ production cycles, I think advanced brake systems – combined braking systems or anti-lock braking systems – are a good thing, and a better level of safety has been achieved, which was one of our main objectives. At the same time, account has been taken of the technological differences and the different performance and cost of various subcategories of motorcycle.

Until now, the 2002 Framework Directive and 14 other directives referring to it set out the requirements in a rather convoluted legislative framework that is happily being replaced by a consolidated text. A refined vehicle categorisation achieved by introducing more appropriate subcategories, more severe emission limits, the mandatory introduction of anti-lock brake systems on some types of vehicle and the automatic headlight-on system to improve the visibility of L-vehicles are just some of the innovations to be introduced thanks to this report.

The European Commission’s proposal concerning simplification of procedures is therefore a step towards reducing the costs borne by citizens. The report also contains the required solutions, for example a standardisation of requirements relating to exhaust gas emissions and the introduction of systems to prevent unauthorised tampering with vehicles. The inclusion of agricultural four-wheel vehicles within the scope of the regulation concerning tractor units should also have the effect of improving road safety. Thanks to the efforts of my political group, universal use of an anti-lock braking system in motorcycles only covers high-powered two-wheel vehicles, and will thus not affect those with a larger engine and scooters. An assessment of the consequences has revealed that the existing cheaper braking systems are adequate for these vehicles. The durability requirements for motorcycles and the schedule for the introduction of the new provisions have also taken our comments into account. I am consequently supporting this report.</p>

Firstly, its simplification of the legislation: the Regulation will replace 24 existing Directives and will allow harmonisation within the Member States through its direct effect on national legal systems. In addition, by laying down common European-wide technical requirements for these it should increase the market’s competitiveness. The introduction of new technologies including anti-lock braking systems and electronic stability control systems will certainly help to improve the safety of these vehicles.

The Commission’s proposal to have these matters covered by a single regulation would therefore appear to be the optimum solution, and for that reason I supported the resolution. The proposal most worthy of comment is that of having virtually all types of tractor covered by a duty of type approval, with this requirement not relating to manufacturers of trailers or towed equipment. It is worth pointing out, however, that possession of an EU type approval will permit a vehicle to operate throughout the EU. The introduction of some differentiation between tractors with regard to their speed will also enable more precision to be brought to bear in regulations that are unclear in this respect. Additional requirements will thus only affect higher-speed machines. The virtual elimination of unfavourable conditions of competition in the case of off-road vehicles, manufacturers of which will be able to obtain type approval in all category T types, will be of major significance. Farmers will consequently not be burdened by the potential unjustified costs of any changes to vehicles.</p>

The paper aims to get more competition, more choice, more innovation and more payment security, as well as customer trust. However, customer trust is something that needs to be earned. Standardisation of the security of payments is a must. As common technical standards are developed, so too must common security payments be. Market-based self-regulation of security payments is an absolute non-runner and the Commission must legislate for this.

However, we need to look at this in greater detail.

In my opinion, we should focus on common security standards whereby standardisation should not hinder economic competition and the development of innovation.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I voted in favour of the text adopted today, which stems from the Commission Communication of 2011 on Social Business Initiative. The Europe 2020 strategy lies ahead, and with it we will need to provide answers to the ever-increasing need for social services, for example in the health and nursing sectors, and to estimate the demographic trend we have to deal with. However, this must be accompanied by a high degree of innovation and experimentation, the success or failure of which is a matter for the European institutions to evaluate within a set timescale, so we can see whether this initial approach could bring about improvements and can continue to develop this type of enterprise effectively in the longer term.</p>

Social enterprises, particularly in the health and social care services and in the green economy, are now a major feature of European society and are indeed an integral part of the European social model. They account for two million enterprises, ten percent of all European enterprises; they employ 11 million people or six percent of all workers in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Social enterprises are therefore important drivers of sustainable development, social innovation and inclusion and indeed the participation of marginalised groups. I believe that they have a major role to play in achieving the social, employment and educational targets of the EU 2020 Strategy.

A stronger social enterprise economy will help accomplish the goals of the Single Market Act as well as the Europe 2020 Strategy. They need support that is specifically designed for their benefit.

Social enterprises employ more than 11 million people today in the EU. Thanks to their innovative potential they contribute to creating new jobs in various areas of employment, such as health care, nursing care, education and training, culture or tourism. They can help integrate vulnerable groups into the labour market. For a social enterprise to enjoy rapid growth and development, the two main requirements are committed personnel and additional financing. We have to increase awareness of these financing opportunities and make them more accessible to young enterprises.

There is no doubt that among the 27 Member States that share the single market, the exequatur procedure has become a mere formality, in addition to making the cross-border litigation process more time-consuming and costly.

Since a series of amendments are to be made, that Regulation should, in the interests of clarity, be recast. The Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, inter alia by facilitating access to justice, in particular through the principle of mutual recognition of judicial and extra-judicial decisions in civil matters. For the gradual establishment of such an area, the Union is to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. In order to attain the objective of free circulation of judgments in civil and commercial matters, it is necessary and appropriate that the rules governing jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments be governed by a legal instrument of the Union which is binding and directly applicable.

      <p sl="pl">I am pleased to see the results of many months of negotiations on the new principles of jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments. The most important element of the new regulation is the potential for automatic recognition of cross-border judgments relating to civil and commercial cases issued in different Member States. Previously the cost of confirmation of judgments varied, depending on the country, between EUR 2 000 and 12 000. The removal of this time-consuming and very costly procedure will lead to a saving of more than EUR 47 million a year, and will also lead to quicker and easier assertion of their rights by EU citizens. It is also important that Member States have retained the right to suspend or refrain entirely from the enforcement of a judgment if it is not concordant with the State’s legal order. The extension of procedures to allow the filing of actions by a company or an employee of a company from outside the Member States, which is additionally proposed in the report, will significantly facilitate the assertion of rights in disputes of an international nature. I agree with the rapporteur that this is a good step along the road towards simplification and standardisation of European legal rules, to enable them to come into line with the challenges posed by the single market. The new regulation, which reinforces the current legal framework, not only eases access by EU citizens to the administration of justice guaranteed by Article 23 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, but also means that it will be more comprehensible to them, and less costly, which is an excellent reflection of trends towards the creation of a more transparent and friendly EU law.</p>

I therefore consider it justified to harmonise them in order to guarantee the free movement of chemical substances and mixtures within the internal market, while ensuring a high level of protection of the safety of the general public. Since the objective of this Regulation, namely limiting access by the general public to chemicals that may be used to make home-made explosives, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the European Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Given that the retail and wholesale distribution of chemical materials is both risky and alarming from a security perspective – in relation to technologies and products with more than one purpose – I lend my full support to all efforts aimed at tightening licensing procedures. However, it is important to emphasise that these efforts will only be successful if the ultimate outcome has certain risk benefits for the consumer as well. Thus, recognising the situations of workers in the various economies, we have to realise that the scope of activities subject to licensing should be regulated at distributor level. In the light of this I welcome all efforts designed to facilitate the harmonisation of activities between national licensing authorities – alongside strict reporting requirements and permanent operational supervision – thereby helping to improve and develop the legal certainty of bilateral consumer protection.</p>

Much stricter safety standards would, of course, be needed for the Mediterranean, because this is a particularly sensitive area in view of its semi-enclosed nature and significant seismic activity, and because exploration and exploitation operations in the area are steadily increasing.

      <p sl="pt">This report is in favour of the EU’s accession to the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution resulting from exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf and the seabed and its subsoil. The Protocol requires the Parties to take, individually or through bilateral or multilateral cooperation, all appropriate measures to prevent, abate, combat and control pollution in the Mediterranean Sea area including the waters, the continental shelf, and the seabed and its subsoil resulting from (oil and gas) exploration and exploitation activities, by ensuring that the best available techniques, environmentally effective and economically appropriate, are used for this purpose. The Protocol covers permit requirements, removal of abandoned or disused installations, use and removal of harmful substances, liability and compensation requirements, as well as provisions on safety, contingency planning and monitoring. The experience of accidents which have occurred over the years – with the accident in the Gulf of Mexico presenting the most recent and tragic case – has shown that offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation require effective measures for regulation and control to protect workers, populations and ecosystems, placing them above the profits of the multinationals in the sector.

The European Union, with its 500 million consumers, is the community that is the biggest global consumer of fish, so it needs to meet its requirements by fishing in waters outside its own territorial waters. For its part, Greenland’s economy is highly dependent on fisheries and the export of fishery products, specifically to the European Union. In 2010 exports to the EU amounted to 92.7 % of total exports. However, the balance of trade is clearly in the EU’s favour. I voted in favour of the recommendation, since, in addition to making it possible for the EU fishing fleet to continue to fish in waters under the protection of the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland with effect from 1 January 2013, it ensures protection of fishery resources by promoting a responsible and sustainable fisheries policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The first fisheries agreement between the European Community and Greenland was signed in 1985, one year before Portugal joined the Community. Fishing in Greenland’s waters is yet another example of how national interests were left out of account in the accession negotiations and the subsequent integration of national fisheries into the common fisheries policy. Portugal is one of the European countries with the longest and richest histories of fishing in those waters. Nevertheless, the fishing opportunities granted to Portugal under that agreement, in the name of a relative stability that never recognised the historic Portuguese presence in those waters, strongly discriminate against our fleet. In the agreement which has now expired, Portugal was not in a position to make effective use of the quota of 1 000 tonnes of halibut. The national vessels (bottom-set longline) that travelled to Greenland did not manage to exploit the stock effectively. In the new agreement Greenland made available to the EU a new quota of 2 000 tonnes of demersal redfish, from the stocks which grew up between Iceland and the Greenlandic Exclusive Economic Zone. In the forthcoming negotiations a fair distribution of that quota between the Member States is now required, recognising the legitimate rights and aspirations of the Portuguese fleet, which has suffered such obvious discrimination and harm.</p>

It is with a northern country yet follows the model of southern agreements in exchanging financial compensation for fishing rights. Finally, it was the first one to begin the now general approach of specifying amounts of money for fishing quotas and distinct amounts for fisheries development aid. The primary beneficiaries of the agreement are the northern Member States (Germany, UK, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia), with the southern ones much less than usual (Spain, Portugal). Many of the quotas obtained from the agreement are used by the EU in trade with Norway and Iceland (the EU may trade the capelin it receives from Greenland to get redfish from Iceland, for instance). The protocol with Greenland gives access to thirteen stocks (many of which are deep-sea species that are highly vulnerable to commercial exploitation), some of which are heavily overexploited. Some of these fisheries are mixed fisheries where fish is caught by bottom trawlers which have important by-catch levels. As a result of these problems, and combined with the fact that Greenland is heavily dependent on fisheries and the money it earns from it, we abstained on FISH.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The issue of the right to stand or vote in European elections for citizens residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals remains rather controversial and raises important practical questions, not merely theoretical ones. I believe that any changes to the electoral systems and the way in which Members of the European Parliament from the various Member States are elected, must be approached with the greatest care. I therefore recommend that all amendments should be restricted to the minimum necessary for bringing elected members closer to the electorate and that we should avoid using technical issues for political ends. That said, I think that the majority opinion today is that, if the national parties standing for election to the European Parliament agree, they could include on their lists citizens of other Member States and this possibility should not be hindered.

When the last European elections were held in 2009, this matter was discussed but no agreement was reached. With new elections approaching, the Council is submitting for the approval of the European Parliament a draft Council directive amending Directive 93/109/EC of 6 December 1993 as regards certain detailed arrangements for the exercise of the right to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament for citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals. The new Directive allows candidates to stand for election in their Member State of residence, although candidates are required to indicate in their application their last address in the home state to make sure that relevant information is given by the home state. If elected and found to be in error later, measures will be taken to prevent candidates taking up their seat. Since we urgently need to adopt these amendments and in view of the favourable opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I voted in favour of this draft Council directive.</p>

The content of the report cannot be separated from the gradual attempts to confuse and break the link that Members of the European Parliament have to each Member State and to their reality and their community; this could destroy the peoples’ sovereignty – the right to decide upon their present and their future in accordance with their rights and aspirations. This path will inevitably lead to impoverishment of political and democratic rights and freedoms, to the strengthening of the European parties (linked to and dependent upon funding and upon respect for the rules and principles of the EU), to an attempt to reduce still further the number of Members elected by each country, thus truncating plurality of party representation. The intention is clear: to exclude from institutional representation, by administrative means, the parties that pose a threat to the interests of big business and the major powers that dominate the EU institutions, thus creating a political system totally subjugated to the interests and needs of big business and the major powers, bringing greater exploitation and denying the peoples their right to development.</p>

The Directive provides that no person may vote more than once or stand as a candidate in more than one Member State at the same election. The difficulties, which jeopardise the operability and efficiency of the information-exchange arrangements, could be overcome only by harmonising the rules on entry in the national electoral rolls. Such measures would be disproportionate in relation to the objective pursued. I therefore believe that the exchange of information should accordingly be abolished but the obligation for the voter or candidate to produce a declaration undertaking to exercise his or her right to vote or to stand as a candidate only in the Member State of residence should be maintained. A routine check of all the votes and of all the candidacies would be disproportionate to the problems identified, and would be difficult to implement. Member States should accordingly target their checks on the situations where there is a greater probability of double voting or double candidature.</p>

Originally, it was not only the right to stand as a candidate that was addressed, but also the right to vote. Due to resistance from the Council, however, this report now deals only with the right to stand. What matters is not where MEPs originally come from, but how willing they are to work on behalf of a particular region. Nowadays, many EU citizens decide to leave their country of origin and set up home in another country. If people take this decision, in my opinion there is no reason to prevent them from becoming politically active there. I therefore welcome the – albeit modest – improvement in terms of administrative convenience provided for in this report.

At a time when eurosceptic views are on the rise, we should be particularly concerned that EU citizens take part as extensively as possible in the elections, and that Parliament’s mandate is as strong as possible. One procedural restriction on participation in the elections is the difficulty of voting in a country where electors have their place of residence but of which they are not nationals. This is a growing group of people who are seeking work or receiving education in other countries. Unfortunately the directive that is on the table provides no solution to this problem. It does not extend the right to vote, but merely introduces administrative changes to make things easier for potential candidates. In other words, it makes it easier to stand for election, but it does not support implementation of the right to vote, which is based on the potential to play a real part in elections.

      <p sl="ro">One of the fundamental principles of the single market is precisely the harmonisation of legislative conditions in order to make trade more efficient. The shaping of this legislative framework for consumer credit will firstly eliminate differences in terms of regulation, thereby offering consumers a far wider range of services and offerings. Secondly, through such initiatives, the common market becomes a concrete reality with real coverage, which lends substance to the mechanisms and institutions of the European Union. It is, however, equally important for consumer protection to be prioritised at all times during the process of expanding trade or the scope of credit services. I support the adoption of the report and believe that it is imperative for the Member States to take decisive action so that consumers will be better informed about the products and services available to them.</p>

Whilst on the one hand it is true that the harmonisation of some aspects of credit law has significantly raised the level of consumer protection in Europe, on the other hand, the increase in the cross-border take-up of consumer credit would seem to have been insignificant. This may be because only a few institutions offer cross-border consumer credit and because the market as a whole has been in decline in recent years as a result of the crisis. As regards the implementation of Directive 2008/48/EC on credit agreements for consumers, some problems were noted, in particular, failure by some Member States to transpose all or some of the provisions of the Directive by the deadline set. Many Member States have extended the scope of the Directive to cover other financial products.

      <p sl="pl">Because some countries have failed to adhere to the deadlines for transposition of regulations concerning the functioning of financial institutions, there is coming to be a need to monitor their implementation with a view to securing the interests of consumers. Further clarity is needed at least as far as the discrepancies associated with interpretation of the period for withdrawal from a credit agreement are concerned. Particular attention needs to be devoted to the exertion of pressure on financial institutions to make them provide consumers with exhaustive information that is comprehensible and meets their needs regarding the risk of taking out loans in foreign currencies before any agreement has been signed. Last year’s review on consumer credit websites revealed – in the case of almost half of these sites – a lack of mandatory information, chiefly relating to costs and the duration of agreements, and consequently information of exceptional importance. The increasing popularity of SMS loans is also deserving of attention; although it has many advantages, it can quite often lead the potential client into a particular situation with no exit. We should strive to ensure that there is effective protection for consumers in this area. I support the report.</p>

The current situation regarding fundamental rights when obtaining credit in Europe remains almost unchanged as the take-up of cross-border consumer credit has indeed decreased in recent years. It is believed that this could have been the result of the financial crisis. It is also important to note that the obstacles to the take-up of cross-border consumer credit are more likely to be linked to the language barrier or the lack of any personal relationship with the financial institution concerned than to legal considerations.

The problem is that there are not many cross-border loans, because of the language barrier and the lack of any personal relationship with the lender. That is just common sense. Consumers, who often regard bankers, together with insurers and mobile telephone providers, as the top three crooks and thieves, are not enthusiastic about doing business with one of them who does not speak their language and is not very clear about the clauses that cause problems.

However, the implementation of the EU Consumer Credit Directive, as undertaken by the Member States by the middle of 2010, leaves something to be desired.

This is even more important in the case of cross-border credit, for which easily comprehensible information on foreign currency lending and the costs of additional services is essential when choosing credit. I very much welcome the fact that the existing deficiencies in the implementation of the Consumer Credit Directive have been exposed. This once again constitutes one of many examples of situations in which the EU has created, out of 27 different sets of national regulations, a single Directive that is intended to benefit consumers, but the Member States have failed to implement it correctly and as a result the purpose of the Directive, namely to protect consumers, has fallen by the wayside.</p>

Thus a good instrument is in effect; unfortunately it will be unable to fulfil its aims if it is not properly and effectively introduced into the national legal order of Member States. I support the report because I fully concur that the proper transposition of EU law by Member States, without unnecessary delay, is absolutely necessary for consumers to be effectively protected, and for the single market to function properly in this respect. The issues that have turned out to pose particular problems in the transposition process are those of advertising, information conveyed prior to conclusion of an agreement, early repayment and calculation of the annual rate of interest.

For this reason, information on consumer credit that emphasises possible changes in payments and the consequences of insolvency should be spread more actively.

The outcome of this review was as follows: on 46 % of the websites checked mandatory information was lacking in the advertising material, on 43 % clear information concerning the overall costs, the duration of the agreement and certain credit-related costs was lacking, and on 20 % the presentation of the costs was misleading. In the current implementation phase the national authorities are contacting the firms concerned and calling on them to remedy the shortcomings identified. As there are still many unclear points to be clarified and the share of cross-border consumer credit agreements is dwindling to almost negligible, I abstained from voting.</p>

      <p sl="lt">It is essential to extend consumer protection at both national and EU level. Efficient consumer protection practices in the credit sector are some of the most important conditions in ensuring financial stability. I believe that special attention should be paid to short-term credit provided through various communication media. First of all, excessive risk should be prevented altogether. It is also essential to provide consumers with comprehensive and easily understandable information on the risks involved in borrowing. Furthermore, by using legal acts, it should be ensured that when a consumer decides to withdraw from a contract, no additional charges are incurred. It should be noted that the objectives set out in the Directive cannot be fully achieved unless they are suitably transferred to and implemented in the Member States.</p>

This vote is important for consumer protection. The countries of the European Union were supposed to have implemented this Directive by 11 June 2010. However, some Member States, including Belgium, have delayed the transposition of all or some provisions of the Directive. This delay is essentially due to the short transposition deadline, i.e. two years, and the scope of the legislation involved. As a reminder, this Directive has two objectives: 1) to guarantee a high level of consumer protection and 2) to strengthen the internal market in cross-border consumer credit.

The Consumer Credit Directive was adopted in 2008 with the purpose of enhancing convergence between the national provisions regarding consumer credit (see also here attached our briefing note from the adoption of the directive in 2008). This is of course a very important legislation in particular in view of the fact that credit problems were central in the current economic crisis (even though they concerned more mortgage credits, which are not covered by the consumer credit directive). The main provisions of the directive concern pre-contractual and contractual information to consumers, a harmonised period for the right of withdrawal (14 days), protection in case of early repayments and an obligation to assess consumers' creditworthiness. The directive applies to consumer credits (not mortgage) between EUR 200 and EUR 100 000. Greens/EFA share the Rapporteur’s main messages.

      <p sl="sk">When additional taxes were introduced for banks in my country, Slovakia, analysts and bank officials responded by stating that they had a planned profit which, if compromised, would increase bank charges and clients would once again lose out. Therefore, as part of free trade and services, I welcome the possibility of cross-border consumer credit. The Consumer Credit Directive creates not only a common European legal framework, but also competitiveness in the overall cost of credit. Slovak banks, which were privatised as debt-free concerns and without any liabilities with high packages, now offer consumer and mortgage loans which are 25 % more expensive than, for example, banks in Italy. I can therefore see that as part of cross-border consumer credit competition this Directive will greatly benefit the strengthening of the cross-border internal market in consumer credit and I look forward to the creation of legal and technical measures that would create a standard sheet that would enable the consumer to reliably compare offers from different credit providers.

That is the conclusion of the interim evaluation report that is before us here and for which I voted. The directive governs the (pre)contractual information for consumers, a harmonisation of the period of reflection (14 days), protection in the event of early repayment of debts and the requirement to check beforehand the creditworthiness of consumers. The interim evaluation indicates problems with the transposition of the directive. There are specific problems regarding the obligation to provide information: not all lenders inform the consumer correctly or they provide too much detailed information that is no longer comprehensible. The right to change one’s mind is not always observed, there is still no uniformity in the checking of the creditworthiness of customers and there is the increasing problem of SMS loans, particularly to vulnerable groups and young people. The possibility of early repayment works reasonably well.

For example, in many states consumers are quite often not aware of the risks and costs that might arise if they opt in favour of loans in another currency. Therefore, among other suggestions, the report recommends that Member States’ consumer rights supervisory authorities should require financial institutions to provide consumers with personalised, complete and easily understandable explanations regarding the risks involved in foreign currency lending.</p>

Well-targeted social investments are imperative in order to achieve better education and training outcomes in the European Union, since they remain inadequate to meet labour market needs.

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the Report on Social Investment Pact as I believe that is a good response to the crisis. The idea set forth in this agreement shall be an exit strategy from the economic and social crisis. A crisis that is still a real threat to the stability of many European Union countries which are facing enormous problems, especially in terms of unemployment. Even more worrying are the rate of youth unemployment and the chronic lack of jobs among people with low but also high qualifications. The crisis requires not only to remodel social policies of the Member States but also to actively transform the welfare state, in a state that invests in people, in a state that provides citizens with the tools and incentives, in a state gives them a chance to build a real career and a real future.</p>

The current trajectory of public debt in most Member States in the euro area is unsustainable, which is why we need to reduce our dependence on credit, which is achievable only by cutting State spending. However, whilst it is essential to reduce debt and put the public accounts in order, it is also necessary to complete such measures with real incentives for growth, competitiveness and employment, in order to bring growth back to Europe and to end the recession. In this context, I think we could and should make a targeted study of the proposal on the Social Investment Pact mentioned in this report.

The crisis must spur us on to foster the creation of skilled jobs under the Europe 2020 strategy, which entails a coordinated approach to social investment. Implementation of the recommended measures will enable progress in the economies of the Member States. By investing in social policies, we are giving people the possibility to take part in the labour market, thus reducing the social exclusion to which they might fall victim.

The usual trick of trying to mix oil and water. Based on that humbug, the proposal is to have a process of transition from the ‘active welfare state’ to what is dubbed the ‘activating welfare state’. Proposals that are made, it must be said, with a straight face and a pained expression since such is the concern about the ‘welfare state’. There is only one ‘welfare’ measure needed, to be taken by the workers and peoples of Europe: to throw these policies, entailing state buck-passing and the shrugging off of the State’s social functions, to the rubbish bin of History. The saga goes on: the promotion of precarious labour relations (flexicurity), the increase in the retirement age, the privatisation of public services – the creation of social investments – to be included in the National Reform Plans and, in general, in the EU’s macro-economic and budgetary monitoring strategies.

The majority of recent and current responses to the crisis are based on short-term goals aimed mainly at bringing back the sustainability of public finances, which is crucial to the EU economy. As a consequence of the economic and social crisis the unemployment rate in [January 2012 stood at more than 10 % in the EU 27]. As a consequence of the crisis, the pressure on social assistance schemes has increased in many countries and the revenues for pension schemes, employment benefits or healthcare systems have dropped considerably. The majority of recent responses to the crisis seem to lack a social and employment policy dimension. The first attempt to create a coordinated EU response towards employments and social policies in Europe, the Lisbon Strategy together with the European Employment Strategy, failed to deliver due to weak governance and unfortunately, from what we can observe, the success of the Europe 2020 strategy is uncertain and requires stronger engagement from Member States. I share the view that the recently developed economic governance and macroeconomic surveillance should be supplemented by monitoring of employment and social policies. I also consider it to be justified for the Member States to sign a ‘Social Investment Pact’ through which they could create better governance and control mechanism over implementation of the employment, social and education goals of Europe 2020.</p>

Tackling poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, shortcomings in our educational systems on the one hand and promoting social inclusion and assistance on the other hand is the way forward. The European social model is based on solidarity, equality, social justice and human rights.

Social investments have proven to be excellent tools for matching skills available in education and training with the demands of the labour market as well as for reconciling the goals of economic and social policy. The exchange of good practices in this field should therefore be fostered by the European Commission and Member States should consider tax advantages for social enterprises and for investors in social businesses.

One way in which this will be made possible is through the Social Investment Pact, which I voted in favour of today.

Therefore, in addition to establishing the common basic standards needed for social protection at the level of the entire European Union, the idea of a social investment pact is especially opportune when the objectives of fiscal consolidation are so negatively reflected in cuts in public investment in education, health and social protection.

It is the younger generation that is most affected. Students who are currently graduating from university are encountering various obstacles preventing them from fully participating in the workforce. Whether it is because of a lack of jobs, employers’ requirements for high qualifications or the natural aging of the population, the consequences of the crisis are unimaginable. Young people must tackle them alone. However, there is a rule that states that the longer a young person is unemployed, the more complex and more difficult it is to get any kind of job. The economic and social consequences of youth unemployment are alarming. Without work, it is absolutely impossible to plan for the future, develop skills or participate in community life. If we do not protect the interests of the younger generation, what future awaits us? For these reasons, I urge all relevant actors to focus on better allocation of public funds and to ensure a sufficient share of funds in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 for the support of employment, job creation and support for educational programmes and professional qualifications, which could bypass the risks arising from the crisis.

Social investment is investment against poverty, against exclusion from opportunities; it is investment in skills and qualifications; investment in humanity. Consequently its value and its importance are not simply linked with growth; above all, it brings multiple returns in the future. This is because if a family or a human group is given the opportunity to work or the opportunity to escape marginalisation and social exclusion, then, in addition to the economic benefit which undoubtedly results from one person’s employment, there is a further benefit. Our fellow citizen who is unemployed and is therefore an unproductive unit of society is transformed into a healthy and productive member of society who has something to contribute. Therefore, social investments are investments in human beings and in social cohesion. They must be seen as such, especially in these critical times, when the crisis in Europe, in addition to being an economic crisis, is in many cases a social crisis and a crisis of values.</p>

      <p sl="it">The majority of recent and current responses to the crisis are based on short-term goals aimed mainly at bringing back the sustainability of public finances, which is crucial to the EU economy. However, the current economic and financial crisis will undoubtedly have long-term and intense effects not only on the European economy but also on the employment rate, public savings and social investments in Europe. It has therefore become necessary to complete these austerity measures with growth- and employment-friendly measures such as well targeted social investments that aim to prepare individuals, families and societies to adapt to changing economic conditions and labour market demands.

      <p sl="en">I support the Social Investment Pact as it addresses the new social risks faced by the European Union as a result of the economic crisis. While fiscal consolidation remains a priority, it is highly important that future development is not hampered by neglecting social policy. Issues of employment and education must not be forgotten as Member States strive to meet budgets. By committing fully to the social pact, a state will ensure a stronger, brighter future for the next generation. The pact sets out investment targets and goals in terms of combating youth unemployment and problems with the current social assistance schemes. While financial stability is important, it must be acknowledged that budget consolidation must be complemented by a social investment strategy. Without the maintenance of strong social policies, we will not be able to create sustainable jobs, restore the faith of many citizens in national and European institutions, nor can we pave the way towards greater stability in the future.</p>

In order to restore sustainable growth, well-targeted investments in line with the objectives set out in the report on the Social Investment Pact are essential. As well as sustainable public finances, Member States should focus on helping the unemployed, creating jobs and improving productivity at work. We will still need to invest in training, to improve education and to reform pension systems. Finally, it is also essential to make every effort to combat poverty and social exclusion. The Member States should therefore be called on to ensure that the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 contains appropriate budgetary resources to stimulate and support social investments in Europe, and that the available funding, especially the European Social Fund, is supportive of social investments.</p>

I support this report as I believe that social investments should be a key part of the economic and employment policies of the European Union and the Member States in the face of the crisis. I agree with the rapporteur and urge the Member States to consider signing a ‘Social Investment Pact’, which can serve as a basis for the creation of a reinforced control mechanism to improve efforts to meet the employment, social and education targets of the Europe 2020 strategy.

In 2011 the rate of poverty among 16- to 24-year olds in Europe was 21.6 % on average, and young people are more likely to be in precarious fixed-term or part-time employment, and are also at a higher risk of unemployment. Social investments should be an important part of EU and Member States’ economic and employment policies, and of their responses to the crisis, in order to achieve the employment, social and education objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. All public social and health services, education services and related services sourced from private service providers, among others, can be considered social investments. I reiterate that they have been determined in agreements as falling under national competence. Facilitating and focusing on social entrepreneurship and access to microfinance for vulnerable groups and those furthest away from the labour market are essential elements in the context of social investment, in that they allow the creation of new sustainable jobs, often causing permanent changes in the economic cycle.</p>

As a result of the crisis the pressure on social security systems in many countries has increased and income from pension, unemployment and health systems has fallen sharply. High long-term unemployment rates will further intensify this trend. Unfortunately the majority of recent responses to the crisis lack a social and employment policy dimension.

As they aim at reconciling social and economic goals, they should be treated by governments not only as spending, but rather as investments that will give real return in the future. It also seems that the crisis requires from Member States that they rethink their social policies and make a transition from ‘active welfare state’ to ‘activating welfare state’ which invests in people and gives citizens instruments and incentives rather than only responding to emerging damages caused by market failure.

Development of the public economy, in its broader sense, may be very helpful at times when it is not only the homeless, the long-term unemployed or the disabled who are out of work and with very limited means on which to live. The crisis, which affects both employers and employees, means that the situation on the labour market is becoming unstable. At times of crisis and a continuous reduction in employment, more and more citizens are threatened by poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Public enterprises, social cooperatives and occupational activity centres have the task of making a profit, which is then targeted at the implementation of social goals or the development of the local community. These are therefore useful instruments which help to solve social problems that are important to all of us. A public enterprise may also constitute an opportunity for young people who cannot get onto the labour market. As my colleague Ms Jazłowiecka correctly pointed out in the report, social policy in EU countries has to change dynamically and bring in effective and lasting ways of resolving social problems. Social investments are the best example of such an action, and every effort should be made to ensure that such strong entities can prosper in a free market and become an effective means of avoiding social exclusion.</p>

Based on this idea, she suggests a process of transition away from an ‘active welfare state’ to what she dubs an ‘activating welfare state’. What this concept really means is the State divesting itself of any responsibility in terms of guaranteeing social rights, in particular as concerns providing public services, placing the emphasis on individual responsibility, the creation of private social services – in other words, the privatisation of public services –, the championing of precarious labour relations (flexicurity) and an unacceptable increase in the retirement age, chomping at the bit to destroy yet another social right won by workers. In this way, the rapporteur maintains that the privatisation of public services will lead to economic recovery – the creation of ‘social investment’ – and that these should be included in the National Reform Programmes and, in general, the EU’s macroeconomic and any budgetary surveillance strategies. The path towards worsening workers’ living conditions will always be unacceptable to us.</p>

Consolidating this dimension of promotion and information in order to establish European products in traditional and emerging markets is equally important. Without doubt, improvements need to be made to the current framework for the promotion of agricultural products and information regarding production processes. A functional and efficient compromise needs to be reached between the need to make the European economy more productive and competitive and the imperative of better promotion of European agricultural products and better information for European consumers.

If we want consumers to be fully aware of the high quality excellent produce produced by European farmers to the highest standards then we must communicate this information to them clearly, simply and in a manner that they can use and respond to. The agri-food sector is a strong sector and one that has the potential to be the catalyst for economic growth in many Member States. In Ireland alone the agri-food industry is flourishing, food and drink exports increased by 12 % last year, reaching close to EUR 9 billion.

It is essential to make current promotion measures for European agricultural products simpler and more coherent, thereby increasing agricultural incomes, creating employment and generating growth. Information and promotion policy aims to use the development of global demand to promote interest in EU produce among consumers in third countries. Effective promotion policy is necessary to stimulate EU agriculture, guarantee food security and the sustainable use of natural resources and create employment in rural areas. EU products are highly diverse and meet particularly high standards and food security levels. It is essential to promote them both within and outside the EU, as well as to increase their export.

The statement that the ‘success of European farmers will depend on their ability to increase their market share’ is a telling apology for the ‘productivist’, export-based models that sacrifice food quality, security and sovereignty for the ‘competitiveness’ of a few large farms. We do not agree that the indication of European origin should prevail as the main indication of product origin either in the internal market or in third countries. Indicating the national origin, as we now well know, is crucial in supporting, highlighting and promoting national production, shorter supply chains and the operation and value of local and regional markets. These are important (albeit insufficient) measures to help strike an agri-food balance in countries with the highest deficits, such as Portugal.</p>

In addition, on the internal market, consumers should be made more aware of the quality and diversity of the range of products available. The aim of the legislative proposals currently being negotiated relating to the present issue for the post-2013 period is to enable this policy to contribute fully to the Europe 2020 strategy by supporting agriculture that guarantees food safety, the sustainable use of natural resources and the dynamism of rural areas as well as growth and employment. An efficient promotion policy is key to reaching these objectives. The reform of the common agricultural policy is aimed at improving the organisation of the production, sustainability and quality of agricultural products.

I do think, however, that in order to be more ambitious in promoting quality products that are linked to specific production methods, geographical origins, traditions or cultural contexts, they need to be more actively promoted not only in local markets but also across the whole of the European Union. I am pleased that my fellow Members agree with me that the increasing demand for organic products calls for more active stimulation of their production and promotion. I believe that to achieve these two things, namely the production of more quality and organic products, it is necessary that we first consider the types of agriculture that prevent the loss of biodiversity, such as the beekeeping sector. That is why I am voting for this report as a sign of my support for the rapporteur’s opinion that it is now time to more clearly define a promotion policy which serves to stimulate and reward the production of specific products included in quality schemes and farming practices which protect biodiversity.</p>

The rules on food safety and health, environmental conditions and animal well-being are stricter in Europe than in the rest of the world. These are the conditions required to respond to the concerns of consumers alarmed by the mad cow crisis and E. coli. The flip side of imposing these conditions is to offer quality products that will be suitable for promotion in Europe and the rest of the world, especially in the emerging markets.

      <p sl="hu">The foundation of the EU’s promotion policy has to be better defined. Awareness of the opportunities inherent in local production and short food supply chains must be raised by implementing promotional measures. Developing short food supply chains and local markets can create jobs at local level, and local farming systems will restore added value for farmers. European farmers and producers are facing new challenges and have to apply production systems that adapt to these challenges, such as climate change, lower soil fertility and biodiversity. Promotion activities have to focus more on quality and on products produced at local level. Consumers within the EU are increasingly interested in the tastes of quality products as well as those that have come about through tradition. This is why I support the move to draw attention to a diverse programme of the tastes of Europe that meets consumers’ tastes too, within the framework of promotion measures. I also believe it is important for the individual promotion and information activities to bring citizens and producers together. As part of school programmes providing fruit and milk for pupils, for example, children can be brought closer to the work of agricultural producers. By visiting farms and facilities they can gain first-hand experience of the food production process and how the common agricultural policy works.</p>

To that end, a clear definition of the objectives of the promotion policy for agricultural products is a necessary first step and cannot be detached from a net increase in the budget allocated to this area. We need to focus on the development of short supply chains, for the economic revitalisation and social enhancement of rural life and to show schoolchildren through educational initiatives how food is produced and what life is like in rural areas. Furthermore, the European Union must try to export a model of sustainable agriculture, as well as its products. We just have to implement these fine sentiments.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Although we keep on hearing about businesses re-locating, the food sector is an example that proves that the EU is still a production base. The food sector is the main employer in Europe, with 4.2 million workers, and has a turnover of EUR 1 000 billion annually. Although this sector is currently a recipient and creates jobs, this is due to the common agricultural policy and its quality products, which is making the EU the second-largest exporter of agricultural products. However, we are not resting on our laurels; we are strengthening our long-term position as a leader on the international market. This is precisely the meaning of this report, which I supported and which proposes that we highlight our assets through a policy of promotion that is considered, ambitious and targeted. Examples of the aspects to highlight that I am thinking of are our quality labels, European gastronomy and our environmental and health quality standards for production. What might have seemed to be a constraint on the sector initially has become one of the sales arguments to strengthen our position on the global market, where consumers are looking increasingly for quality and authenticity.</p>

On the other hand, those responsible for trading art must be bound to a commitment towards artists, and at the same time it must be ensured that the added value generated by these works of art is appropriately taken into account, as well as the artists themselves, in European cultural assets.</p>

Despite the wonderful advances made in communications technologies, in terms of cultural freedoms our governments put in place systems that make us pay more while getting less. The cultural industries are suffering from such extreme ownership concentration that cultural diversity is, at least commercially, a joke.

The European art and antiques market makes a significant contribution to the global market. It therefore merits greater attention and protection by us, especially against increasing competition from third countries. I was very struck by the impressive growth recorded by China in this sector and by the general trend of the centre of gravity of the art market shifting towards emerging countries. I therefore think Europe should do everything it can to strengthen the European market and Europe’s position globally. As regards the resale right in particular, I think it is right and necessary that artists can continue to receive payment for their works of art as time goes by, especially younger artists who often part with their work for little money at the start of their career, in order to make themselves known. What is more, this resale right would not have a negative impact on the market or on its location. Lastly, providing for copyright on works of art that would cover the resale of the original might be a good way of preventing discrimination against artists themselves, and I think that its inclusion in the legal systems of various third countries is a good thing.</p>

      <p sl="en">The aim of the Resale Rights Directive is to ensure that visual artists (or their estates) share in the economic success of their work, particularly when its true value is not recognised at the time of its first sale, and to harmonise Member States’ droit de suite legislation, some of which dates back to the 1920s. The Commission’s 2011 report found no clear link between implementation of this directive and the loss of EU art market share. It did find however that an administrative burden was placed on art-market professionals in some Member States. I therefore endorse its recommendation to establish an exchange of best practice and a stakeholders’ dialogue to try to minimise costs, and to produce a further report by 2014. But I believe we need to do more. For example, the Commission should give consideration to moving towards some form of mandatory collective management across the EU so as to guarantee the collection, administration and distribution of royalties. Consideration should also be given to reducing the threshold to EUR 1 000 – studies indicate that this move in Britain increased the number of benefiting artists by over 90%.

      <p sl="pt">The global art market has been valued at roughly 12 billion dollars for 2012 so authors of art works and their heirs must be compensated fairly. At times, one art work is traded time and time again – which exponentially increases its value – without its author or his or her heirs gaining any benefit. The report under examination, drawn up by Marielle Gallo, addresses the application and effects of the Resale Right Directive. The ‘resale right’ is the prerogative for all authors of art works to share in the price each time that their works are sold. Exercising this right at European Union level was harmonised on 1 January 2006. Although the European art market has tailed off, no cause-and-effect link can be attributed to the entry into force of this directive.

The resale right – ensuring that the artist receives a percentage of the profit from the sale of a work of art – guarantees continuity of pay for artists, who very often sell their works at low prices at the start of their careers. In this way, the resale right for the benefit of the living author of an original work of art can help to ensure artists are appropriately compensated for their output. On this occasion, we can but defend the right to create and to cultural and artistic enjoyment, and the role of the State in fostering the conditions for this right to be enjoyed. It is a right that is currently being severely jeopardised in Portugal, despite being enshrined in Portugal’s Constitution.</p>

      <p sl="en">The right to remuneration for the sale of art is one of the first mechanisms harmonising intellectual property law throughout the EU. The Directive, which only entered into full effect in all Member States on 1 January 2012, on the one hand protects the interests of creators, guaranteeing them continuity of remuneration received with each successive professional resale they make, while on the other hand means that the buyer is never the 100 % owner of the work of art and, when deciding to sell it via a ‘professional’, must share his or her income. This complex legal issue, which is none too comprehensible to ordinary citizens, has not, as it would seem, had any negative impact on the position of the European art market, which in 2011 reported record profits of USD 11.57 billion, an increase of over USD 2 billion compared to 2010. Observing this trend, third countries are also planning to introduce unified principles for the resale right, and in practice this would make for equal principles for all and would facilitate the development of competition. In this context I support the application to shift analysis of the Directive by the Commission from 2014 to 2015, in other words four years after the last assessment which was presented in December 2011, in order that the assessment of the rates used, the thresholds and the beneficiary categories may be clearer and more suitable both for artists and for subsequent owners of works of art. The main plank of the Directive was to ensure that the authors of works of art have a share in the economic success of their works, and also to harmonise the application of this right throughout the EU. As may be seen from estimates of the worth of the European art market for 2012 – USD 12 billion – this law is meeting the challenges it faces.</p>

This right applies to all acts of resale involving any dealers in works of art. The royalty is to be paid by the seller. The main points discussed in the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs are its conclusions that reassessing the Directive in 2014, as the Commission plans to do, is premature and that the initiatives taken by third countries to introduce the resale right are welcome. Over all, it does not add much to the Commission’s statements and conclusions. I share the position of my group: the resale right is an unnecessary bureaucratic system which mostly serves to give money to very successful artists, who are already rich, possibly to the detriment of all other, less fortunate, artists.</p>

      <p sl="it">Since the art market has recently seen a very significant overall increase in turnover, its impact on the global economy can no longer be underestimated. By establishing a right over the resale of works of art, this Directive, also known as the Resale Right Directive, has encouraged the harmonisation of legislation on the subject so that artists can receive equal treatment in all the European art markets. In my opinion, we need to take a proper look at the interests of artists, particularly young emerging artists, so that, through the law on the application of the resale right, the administrative obstacles to the functioning of the art market can be removed. I think that the art market can be strengthened and supported through our commitment. For these reasons I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The Resale Right Directive introduces a mandatory resale right for artists and for those who survive them. The resale right is an intellectual property right, whereby following the first sale of a piece of work by an author, the author and those surviving him or her benefit from any subsequent sales. The resale right has been recognised in Hungary for decades, but this Directive has only been applied fully in all Member States since 1 January 2012. The purpose of this legislation is to harmonise the fundamental conditions necessary to apply the resale right on Europe’s art market with a view to reinforcing its position in the world.</p>

This report calls upon the Commission to work closely with stakeholders to strengthen the European art market’s position and to address certain problems, for example the ‘cascade effect’.</p>

      <p sl="pt">2011 was a very positive year for the art market with total revenue for the year of USD 11.57 billion, an increase of more than USD 2 billion on the previous year. There was also strong growth in the European art market in 2011, with the United Kingdom maintaining a 19.4 % share of the global market; France’s market share was 4.5 % and Germany’s was 1.8 %. I can endorse this report as it maintains that the art and antiques market makes a significant contribution to the global economy, supporting various businesses in the creative industries sector.

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the Report on the Implementation and Effect of the Resale Right Directive. Artistic creation contributes to the continual development of the EU’s cultural life and heritage. There was strong growth in the European art market in 2011; the United Kingdom maintained a 19.4 % share of the global market, with an increase of 24 % in sales volume; France’s market share was 4.5 %, with a 9 % increase in turnover; and, Germany saw a 23 % increase in sales, with a market share of 1.8 %. Several of the Directive’s provisions ensure a balanced application of the resale right, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders, in particular the gradual decrease in applicable rates, the EUR 12 500 ceiling on the resale right, the exclusion of small sales and the resale exemption for the first buyer. I stress, however, that the Directive places an administrative burden on dealers. I call on the Commission to undertake an impact assessment of the functioning of the art market in general, including the administrative difficulties faced by smaller and specialist auction houses and dealers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We share the rapporteur’s view that artistic creation contributes decisively to the ongoing development of cultural heritage. In this respect, what is known as the resale right – ensuring that the artist receives a percentage of the profit from the sale of a work of art – guarantees continuity of pay for artists, who very often sell their works at low prices at the start of their careers. In this way, the resale right for the benefit of the living author of an original work of art can be a useful tool to prevent discrimination against artists and to ensure that they receive appropriate compensation for their work. On this occasion, we can but defend the right to create and to cultural and artistic enjoyment – in such danger just now in Portugal – insofar as production of art, particularly by young artists, should be publicly valued and supported and not just viewed as a business opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report as it seeks to review the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. The current issue is whether negotiating mandates should be included in decision-making procedures. One could argue that approval of the committee’s negotiating mandate by the plenary would give more weight to Parliament’s position and could in theory ensure the early involvement of all Members in decisions concerning legislative files. Thus a general rule to submit all draft decisions containing negotiating mandates to a debate at and approval by plenary could at a first glance find its justification in improved democratic legitimacy. However, the disadvantages would also be considerable. A full and automatic involvement would risk making the procedure too heavy and would thus counteract the efficiency and relative speed inherent to first reading agreements. It is also to be borne in mind that this solution would create increased workload for the EP’s linguistic staff. Therefore, the procedures created should be not only flexible and pragmatic, but also assorted according to the political importance of legislative files.</p>

It is instead a procedural change, which, among other things, enables, where the committee responsible considers it duly justified, negotiations to be entered into prior to the adoption of the report in the specialised committee. In other words, trilogue negotiations begin without groups like our own having had the opportunity to table any proposals. The major groups agree so full steam ahead! This is an amendment that limits the ability of groups like ours to intervene, make proposals and raise complaints, groups like ours that break with this consensus that also dominates the other EU institutions and which is, after all, responsible for the process of civilisation going backwards that is now being experienced in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is true that the rapporteur’s proposals and some amendments seem to democratise and clarify some of the current legislative practices. However, the root of the problem is that vitally important legislative reports are adopted in small committees. Certainly, a rapporteur is appointed, which is logical, but shadow rapporteurs are also appointed (one per group), and they cobble together the work for Parliament’s ad hoc committee. In the worst cases, from the start a handful of people who are not representative of the whole political spectrum are appointed to negotiate with the Council and the Commission in order to arrive at a compromise as quickly as possible – a compromise that was agreed at the first reading. The result is that, with or without debate in plenary, we are now increasingly adopting reports drawn up, in reality, by a tiny minority of our technical colleagues. European laws are in fact decided by five or six nameless figures who claim to be experts. The all-powerful technocratic Commission at the centre, 27 Member States with a subdued majority, a few Members invested with the divine light of the other place – this is the reality of the legislative power of the European Union.

This attitude flies in the face of all the marketing about how the European institutions are being made increasingly democratic.</p>

      <p sl="ga">An Irish language version of this Parliament’s website is needed now. For almost six years this Parliament has breached the principle of non-discrimination, by producing its website in 22 of the 23 official EU languages, but not in Irish. This blatant discrimination against the marginalised cannot be justified. The Irish language derogation does not justify it - it concerns legislation, and not communication with the public. Nor is there any shortage of qualified translators. For almost two years the EP has in fact been defying Council Regulation (EU) No 1257/2010, which says clearly, ‘The institutions will continue to take steps to improve access to information in Irish on the activities of the Union.’ The passing of this report on the recording of interventions in plenary should at least ensure that speeches made in Irish will remain on the website in Irish and not be removed as soon as they are translated into English; a small but important step. A formal complaint of language discrimination against the EP has now been lodged with the European Ombudsman. It is high time we had equality here.</p>

This new framework will be in line with current needs, both in terms of better market surveillance, emission levels and the level of safety, which, in my opinion, is a key issue as regards this type of vehicle with the mandatory introduction of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) in new motorcycles up to 50 cc.

I support the main aims of the report, which are a simplification of the current legal framework and specification of new administrative and technical requirements relating to the environment and safety and to market surveillance, as regards the requirements concerning type approval of category L vehicles. A better classification of vehicles is needed in order to ensure safer and more effective mobility, which will play an important role in the subsequent building of a single market. To achieve this aim, an ambitious but also a precise and simple schedule setting out the stages of market surveillance, tougher emissions levels and mandatory requirements in the sphere of safety will be needed. Thought should also be given to new drive technologies and enabling the type approval of category L vehicles fitted with such technology. In my view, the question of safety in respect of category L vehicles is of particular importance. Studies have shown that it is specifically drivers of vehicles of this category who are significantly more prone to serious accidents. The mandatory use of anti-lock brake systems (ABS) or automatic headlight on (AHO) for all new motorcycles, are elements that would definitely lead to an improvement in the level of safety.

With this proposal the European Commission aims to simplify the current legal framework and to establish new administrative and technical requirements, for example on environmental and safety aspects and market surveillance. Type approval requirements for new, L-category vehicles are currently set out in Framework Directive 2002/24/EC and 14 other Directives referring to it. These will be repealed and replaced by the proposal laying down the fundamental provisions and scope. Detailed technical requirements will be defined at a later stage in delegated acts.</p>

      <p sl="it">I decided to vote in favour of this report because the measure will simplify the current regulatory framework and will introduce new administrative and technical requirements concerning the environment, safety and market surveillance for two- and three-wheeled vehicles and quadricycles. The issues that, to my mind, require further attention are identification of the scope of the proposal for a regulation to remove some inconsistencies and reflect the categories of manufacture, make the timetable for application simple and clear to prevent problems for manufacturers with having to introduce the new features required by the regulation too quickly, and introduction of environmental requirements that manufacturers do not find it excessively difficult to comply with.</p>

The new rules being introduced, besides simplifying the regulatory framework, will enable the environmental, safety and market surveillance aspects to be improved. I think that more severe standards for emissions are necessary because, together with the introduction of a regulatory framework covering hybrid and electric vehicles, they are essential for meeting the environmental targets. In my opinion, raising the issue of road safety in this context, in view of the need to make drivers fully aware of it by emphasising the importance of human behaviour when it comes to driving, is an important step towards creating more efficient urban mobility. In the hope that the introduction of these new rules will also be accompanied by better market surveillance, so that vehicles that do not meet the approval requirements cannot be put on the market, I voted in favour.</p>

The Regulation aims to lay down harmonised rules for the approval of L-category vehicles, with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market. L-category vehicles are two-, three- or four-wheel vehicles such as powered two-wheel vehicles, tricycles, on-road quads and mini-cars. The Regulation aims to simplify the current legal framework, to reduce L-category vehicle emissions, to increase the overall level of safety and to strengthen the rules on market surveillance. In the interests of clarity, predictability, rationality and simplification, and to reduce the burdens for vehicle manufacturers, this Regulation should contain a limited number of implementation stages for the introduction of new emission levels and new safety requirements. The industry should be allowed sufficient time to adapt to the new provisions laid down in this Regulation.

Anti-lock braking systems will be mandatory for motorcycles over 125 cc, and the increase in cost should be generally limited by the widespread implementation of this equipment, as has been the case with automobiles. Furthermore, new antipollution standards will be applied gradually between 2016 and 2020. Finally, the entry into force of this regulation in 2016 will signal the end for French motorcyclists of the 100 hp restriction on motorcycles, which has never really proved effective in terms of road safety and could cause insurance cover problems, for example, for a non-restricted vehicle bought abroad.</p>

Under the new regulations, larger motorcycles (i.e. those with an engine larger than 125 cm3) must be fitted with anti-lock brake systems (ABS), while smaller ones (with an engine smaller than 125 cm3) must have ABS or combined brake systems (CBS).

These are L-category vehicles, the number of which in the European Union is estimated at over 30 million. This vehicle category is constantly expanding in Poland too, as it covers motorcycles, mopeds and what are known as quad bikes. It is true that these vehicles are responsible for only 3 % of kilometres travelled in general, but their profile among fatal accidents is shockingly high, at as much as 16 %. For this reason I think it makes sense to increase the safety of these vehicles through the mandatory introduction of anti-lock brake systems (ABS) and automatic headlight on (AHO), so that vehicles of this category are visible. In supporting an increase in the safety of these vehicles, I do, however, wish to draw attention to the fact that it must lead to an increase in the price of mopeds, motorcycles and quad bikes. The question must therefore be posed: is it worth doing this? In my opinion it is worth it, as the protection of human life, and this chiefly concerns young people, is worth it at any cost.</p>

The regulation has much in it that is positive, especially for the Italian tractor and agricultural vehicle industry. It introduces a single legislative instrument to cover all aspects of the operational safety of tractors, both on the road and in the fields. In particular, with the entry into force of the new regulation, all aspects of safety will be translated into legal measures that will constitute a closed list of requirements that can be checked during the type-approval of a vehicle and can be updated quickly as the state of the art evolves. I also welcome the exclusion of mobile machinery – initially included in the Commission proposal – from the scope of its regulation because the characteristics of this machinery are very different from those of agricultural tractors.

This agreement achieves a good compromise between the need to establish appropriate rules on safety and respect for the environment, without excessively penalising manufacturers in the sector. For the repair and maintenance of these vehicles, the text also provides for improvements, guaranteeing on the one hand wider access to the information necessary for such repairs and maintenance, without influencing or restricting those dealing with the specifics of this sensitive sector. Lastly, I would just like to mention an important point concerning ‘quad bikes’. I think it was quite right to differentiate between these vehicles designed for agricultural use and those used only for recreation or transport. We should avoid putting vehicles used for work, which are a necessity, and vehicles used solely but quite legitimately for entertainment, on an equal footing.</p>

The guideline for continuing development of common technical and security standards should be to achieve a level of common infrastructure which would allow a level playing field, encourage innovation and competitiveness but not essentially add restrictions to the way in which the entire field can expand.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In recent years the Hungarian card payment market has been experiencing sustained growth. Although it will probably take another 10-15 years for the ratio of Hungarian card payments to catch up with the figures seen in Western Europe, there has been a clear and unrelenting catch-up trend so far. I believe it is impossible to guarantee that traders will pass on the benefits of the reduction in interbank commissions to consumers. As I pointed out in my plenary speech, legislation on commissions could perhaps ensure a reduction in trader costs, but in terms of the entire market this would have multiple negative effects. Taking into account the likely consequences of regulation I therefore voted in favour of the report, but I rejected the proposed amendments relating to paragraphs 41 and 43.</p>

While new ways of using mobile and internet payments seem to emerge quickly and interest both consumers and businesses, even the card payment market is still far away from its full potential and efficiency. The Commission has published a Green Paper on an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments where it points out several barriers which prevent the European payment market from working as efficiently and openly as possible. There is a need to acknowledge the benefits of promoting and increasing the card, internet and mobile payments in order to offer consumers and businesses an opportunity to have access to more convenient, secure, fast, variable, flexible and cost-effective payment methods. Furthermore, more extensive use of the above-mentioned payment methods is also a key issue if e-commerce is to continue its rapid development and its growing contribution to Member States’ GDPs. Therefore, the gap between domestic and cross-border payments needs to be removed, while the goal in integrating card payment markets should be making cross-border payments as convenient as payments at national level. The internet payments market, however, is strongly at an evolutionary stage and should not be too strongly regulated, because this could hinder the natural development and innovation in the field.</p>

Digital payments are an area where European consumers and businesses face discrimination based on their country of residence and obstacles that should not exist anymore. Card payment fees vary greatly depending on the financial institution and national laws. Further, cards are not inter-accepted across SEPA. Online transactions face the most discriminatory practices, where especially businesses and residents of Member States who joined in 2004 and 2007 face, in addition to the refusal of their cards, refusal as a shipping destination. This is not only a nightmare for the customers, but seriously also hinders free competition. Non-bureaucratic, transparent, and uniform and customer-friendly payment systems have to be implemented without delay across the SEPA area. It is unrealistic to preach about digital single market and about boosting e-commerce at a time when most users face unfair practices and transactions costs that might even exceed the purchase value. I fully support the rapporteur’s demands on the Commission to take legislative action to ensure fair competition, financial inclusion, and transparency for consumers, payment security and the protection of personal data. Uniform legislation would increase consumer confidence and boost e-commerce and definitely contribute to digital single market.</p>

An important role is played by standardisation, which facilitates the entry of new operators. The application of standards in all areas of electronic payment systems is the way to ensure full interoperability of payment models and a method of eliminating the risk of closing the market to potential competitors and innovation. I still perceive barriers hindering the development of payment instruments in the digital market in several areas. This particularly concerns the fundamental problems of different domestic debit card systems that do not work outside the boundaries of particular states. Other obstacles are to be found in the field of electronic payments, which lie in the fragmentation of national solutions and inadequate framework for the implementation of micropayments. I can also see another barrier in mobile payments, which suffer from the inability of key mobile operators to find common ground with phone manufacturers and credit card companies. All payment methods are then faced with one fundamental problem, whereby despite the massive increase in the volume of transactions, average merchant fees do not decrease according to the payment made, either for consumers or for merchants.</p>

Whilst surcharges for the use of card payments are not allowed in some Member States, in other Member States excessive surcharges are to the detriment of consumers. Fees for cash withdrawals are different in each banking institution, and in many cases a fee is levied for looking at one’s account status. Today the real-time clearing and settlement system should not present financial institutions with a problem, but it does remain a problem.

Inadequate supervision of financial institutions that perform bank-like functions but are outside the perimeter of banking regulations is harmful to the stability of EU finances. The activities of institutions of this type could have positive effects, such as risk distribution outside the traditional banking sector. However, they have to be completely transparent. Therefore I agree with the proposals to improve the monitoring and regulation system for such financial institutions as well as to establish a central repo database offering supervisory authorities a complete overview of the global repo market. I also agree with the introduction of an exposure limit of 25 % of own funds for all unregulated entities and imposing a limit on the number of times a financial product can be securitised.</p>

Although the European Union benefits from the positive effects of this sector, it must also guard against the risks of abuse inherent in this type of activity, especially since the latter mainly contribute to funding at-risk projects via short-term loans, which are a potential source of destabilisation.

However, these are outside the scope of regulation, or within a regulatory framework that is tenuous or deals with other matters than systemic risks.

      <p sl="pt">The current economic and financial crisis largely resulted from the malfunctioning of the banking system which, lacking oversight and tighter controls, took advantage of speculative processes which eventually led to the successive bankruptcy of banks and businesses. As shadow banking is outside the sector, it does not respect market rules and may endanger a company’s operations. Therefore, we need tools that would allow us to have greater insight into the sector to stimulate it and, above all, control it so that there is no repeat of what happened. To do this, we need fully operational supervisory mechanisms, which should be provided with a central register of securities purchased to carry out their activity. I voted in favour of Saïd El Khadraoui’s report on shadow banking, which had a turnover of around EUR 46 billion in 2010 – the contagious effect of which is enormous and which could endanger global finance – because it is essential that we create mechanisms to prevent a destructive contagious effect on the regulated banking system.</p>

Few of this system’s practices have vanished since 2008. The report highlights the dependence of the normal banking sector on the shadow sector and that this can threaten the stability of the financial system. It notes that regulation, evaluation and auditing are impossible where there is distortion of credit risk or disturbance of cash flows. Given that this diagnosis is essentially correct, the proposals made by the report, while pretending that something has to change, actually leave everything the same. The problem does not lie in the alleged excesses within shadow banking and how it operates, but in its very existence and essence, which is purely speculative. It is a system dominated by large investment banks with a portfolio of financial instruments several times exceeding the gross domestic product of some countries (even so-called rich countries) which have developed the most speculative tools, particularly with regard to the public debt of States. A system that uses the added value created in the productive sphere (by workers) to create instruments (papers) that are sold and resold, and then the bill is passed to the workers and the people when someone along the speculation chain does not pay up.</p>

Better financial checks and supervision of credit management by regular banks and non-bank financial institutions such as shadow banks have strengthened and been refined since the crisis. The EU is better equipped to monitor the flow of credit throughout the Union and beyond, yet work still needs to be done. The Parliament’s call for the setting up of a central registry of risk transfers between these non-bank financial institutions and regulated financial institutions will enable there to be closer scrutiny and controls.

This mainly concerns hedge funds and money market funds, but also special purpose vehicles, that is institutions that are known for risky transactions. The problem here is that their transactions are not subject to financial market regulation. The Financial Stability Board’s annual report states that in 2011 shadow banks had a turnover of USD 67 trillion (EUR 52.6 trillion). This means that their turnover was up EUR 5 trillion on 2010.

Shadow banking is the system of entities and bodies that operate in parallel with and sometimes obscurely compared with the traditional, better regulated financial markets. Last year it was estimated that the shadow banking system’s turnover was around 50 000 billion euros, a shocking figure that is significantly higher than in previous years. It is easy to understand how such a large figure can affect the traditional markets, and the very negative role this sector played in the current financial crisis has justifiably drawn criticism from a number of quarters. The report therefore proposes better monitoring of this activity and its implications for and interconnectedness with the ‘official’ banking system.

      <p sl="fr">At a time when Belgium has just recapitalised Dexia to the tune of EUR 2.9 billion, shadow banking, a parallel banking system which involves entities not subject to banking regulation (securitisation funds, hedge funds, commercial banks, money market funds, etc.) is still problematic. Although the G20 has adopted a whole series of regulatory measures aimed at making the financial system safer and more viable after the 2007 financial crisis, this shadow finance, connected to the traditional banking system, is still barely or badly regulated. It was assessed at EUR 67 000 billion in 2011 (compared to EUR 26 000 billion in 2002), half of which (46 %) comes from Europe, a continuing upward trend. Although some parts of this system are vital to the real economy and justify a targeted approach, the motion for a resolution approved today in plenary aligns perfectly with the strengthening of transparency rules and regulation of this sector, which is an indispensable pillar of the global economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. Despite representing a significant proportion of the activities of the financial sector, often higher risk activities, the ‘shadow banking’ sector has managed to slip under regulators’ and policy makers’ radars for too long. The EP has today sent a strong political signal to the European Commission and governments on the need to ensure that EU rules properly apply to the sector, to clamp down on overly risky practices and to try and shed more light on what is a murky industry. In spite of the significant economic value and risks of the shadow banking sector, many of the entities involved have managed to escape regulations applying to traditional financial institutions. The financial crisis and the interlinkage of ‘true banks’ and ‘shadow banks’ has effectively meant the transfer of massive amounts of public funds to these unregulated entities. This situation cannot continue and MEPs have today called for this to be addressed.</p>

      <p sl="it">When we talk about the shadow banking system, we are referring to a credit intermediation system that allows money to move around in the absence of rules and outside the confines of traditional banking channels. This is a system that is growing at a rate of 6 000 billion US dollars a year. Much of the blame for the current crisis, which has brought the global financial system to its knees, has been laid with the operations performed by this system. I think we need a regulatory framework that can stop any dangerous practices. We have a duty to evaluate the appropriateness of new and profound changes that will correct the lack of transparency and clear rules. The regulation and supervision of credit activities that take place within the shadow banking system will enable us to prevent the risk of future crises and guarantee financial stability. Given the necessity of defining the application of this parallel system and identifying the risks it involves, I voted in favour.</p>

The European Central Bank should play a major role in this regard. The initiative on a repo data warehouse may be a crucial step towards more transparency. Furthermore, in order to shed light on risk transfers in the financial sector and to identify who has purchased what from whom and how the transferred risks are sorted, the feasibility of the creation of a public utility should be urgently considered by the Commission. Moreover, this data mapping exercise should allow the identification of the aspects of the shadow banking system which have beneficial effects for the real economy and those posing systemic risk or regulatory arbitrage concerns, like excessive maturity and liquidity transformation, leverage and regulatory arbitrage. Once these systemic risks are identified, they must, it seems to me, be tackled by an improved monitoring and regulative response.

The Financial Stability Board issued a Green Paper on shadow banking that focuses on its potential risks and how it can be dealt with from the point of view of its regulation. I agree with this report which calls on the European Commission to effectively and efficiently regulate shadow banking which, in 2011, reached an overall dimension of EUR 51 billion, equivalent to 25 % to 30 % of the total financial system and half of total bank assets.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on Shadow Banking as the shadow banking sector fulfils important functions within the financial system. According to the definition given by the Financial Stability Board, shadow banking refers to the system of credit intermediation that involves entities and activities outside the regular banking system. Regulated entities in the regular banking system take part extensively in those activities defined as part of the shadow banking system, and are in many ways interconnected with shadow banking entities. The shadow banking system creates new sources of financing and offers investors alternatives to bank deposits, but it can also entail potential risks in terms of financial stability in the long term. I voted to make bank balances more reliable and we invite the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal for a separation of retail and investing activities of banks. We call on the Commission to undertake comprehensive impact assessments of the effects of all new legislative proposals on the financing of the real economy.</p>

The Commission’s Green Paper (19 March 2012) was a first step towards genuine monitoring and supervision of shadow banking. This approach is based on the indirect regulation of this system. However, it is regrettable that there is a lack of criticism of the decisive role that all banks played in the current sovereign debt crisis. Direct, extensive regulation of some of its aspects must be implemented. The proposed regulation seems to me wholly inadequate, especially in consumer protection terms, and will not prevent financial institutions from transferring risky assets to less-regulated shadow banking entities. The Commission could encourage changes to the International Financial Reporting Standards, with more attention being paid to aggregates without netting and risk weights. Therefore, I abstained from this vote, which questions neither the relationships between the banking system in general nor these ‘shadow actors’, the number of which has considerably increased over the (Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170)</p>

It notes that regulation, evaluation and auditing where there is distortion of credit risk or disturbance of cash flows is impossible. The majority are enacting change to leave everything the same, seeking to make us believe that the problem lies in the functioning of shadow banking, in its excesses, and not in its very existence. But it is in its existence and in its purely speculative nature that the problem lies. It is a system dominated by large investment banks with a portfolio of financial instruments exceeding several times over the gross domestic product of some countries (even so-called rich countries) which have developed the most speculative tools, particularly with regard to the public debt of States. A system that uses the added value created in the productive sphere to create instruments (papers) that are sold and resold, and then the bill is passed to the workers and the people when someone along the speculation chain does not pay up.</p>

The growing popularity of social networking means that children spend more and more time online. Statistics also show that young Europeans spend up to 40 hours a week in front of the television. They are online 88 minutes a day (2 hours for 15-16-year-olds), starting on average at 9 years of age but in some cases much younger, even before they start schooling and reading. 77 % of 15-16-year-olds and 38 % of young people aged 9-12 are registered on Facebook and need protection from the dangers of the virtual world. For this reason I am happy that the European Parliament has passed the resolution calling for the combating of harmful content and ensuring that the internet is safe for children. We, the Members of the European Parliament, would like to encourage the EU Member States and the European Commission to present a common position and policy guidelines on the protection of children on the internet as soon as possible as well as prepare a proposal regarding a single, common framework directive on the protection of children in the digital world that would summarise all the provisions relating to children that were set out in EU legislation adopted previously.

The broad domain of the digital world is no longer limited to desktop personal computers; we now have smart phones, tablets, etc. Educational institutions are endeavouring to adapt to the digital world; children are educated in using the internet earlier and find it much easier than adults. Several studies have shown that they spend on average one and a half hours a day surfing the internet, from the age of nine years old, and in fact, in many cases they learn how to use the world wide web before they learn how to read and write. However, adult intervention is required to ensure that the internet is used wisely, responsibly and safely.

The spread of chat rooms and other messaging options has increased access to the personal information of children in the digital world. We have to take up the fight against illegal and harmful content. The easy access to internet content related to online harassment, racism, violence and discrimination means that unprotected and naive children do not learn to understand when human dignity is wronged. Responsibility in relation to protecting children from illegal content falls on families, schools and civil society.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The efforts to create an electronic system for certifying ages should be welcomed. Unfortunately, though, the agreement reached in 2009 between operators of 17 social networking sites and the Commission was not fulfilled, designed as it was to improve the protection and security of children.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Owners and administrators of web pages should ensure that systems require mandatory parental consent before processing the personal information of children below the age of 13 years. The biggest problem with this is that if children encounter an internet restriction because of their age, they provide false information about themselves or authentic information but with a higher age when registering themselves on the site.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the Report on protecting children in the digital world. The internet is becoming increasingly present in the lives of children and it gives children and young people an incredible opportunity to make their voices heard. On the other hand it exposes them to high risks and requires action on at least three fronts: access and education, protection and digital citizenship. Moreover I believe that Member States should make efforts to promote systematic education and training for children, parents, educators, schoolteachers and social workers, thus allowing them to understand the digital world and identify those risks which could harm the physical or mental integrity of children. I believe that raising awareness on the rights of children in the digital world would greatly impact the wellbeing of the next generation and protect them from the risks posed by the internet.</p>

Although the use of digital media is nowadays a fundamental tool for learning and information, the truth is that the internet presents numerous risks and threats, especially for younger users: violation of privacy, the commercial or other use of their profiles, health dangers, dependence phenomena, a distorted relationship with reality and their own identity, and sexual exploitation and child pornography. As a parent, I know how difficult the task of parental control of computer resources is, so I think that it is essential to establish a framework of rights and governance to end the fragmentation of legislative provisions currently existing in the field of human rights, protecting privacy, combating sexual abuse, audiovisual media services and e-commerce, in order to protect children in the digital world, as proposed by the rapporteur.</p>

In this regard, everything that we can do to protect them from the evils of the society to which they belong must be done. The advent of the internet age has brought many dangers to its users, especially children and young people for whom it is often a second home. Amongst internet users aged between 10 and 17, 15 % have been subject to invitations of a sexual nature. Moreover, there are abuses involving sexual exploitation and pornography that must be stopped. It has therefore become of the utmost urgency to create legal certainty for internet users. We all remember the recent images of a girl who killed herself because she was the victim of sexual harassment and cyber-bullying. The protection of children is an imperative for European society and it has to take appropriate measures to achieve this protection.

We know that on average a child spends about 90 minutes a day on the internet. The risks are many and varied, especially for health. We share many of the concerns of the report, but we have reservations concerning the prohibitions the rapporteur suggests implementing. Specifically, restrictions on freedom of expression or disrespect for the privacy and protection of data are not justified. The Safer Internet Programme (cybercrime control and exchange of information) should not jeopardise those rights, and we believe this is not guaranteed.

They are online 88 minutes a day, starting on average at 9 years of age, but in some cases even before they start schooling and reading. The first issue to address is still that of the digital divide which in the current economic situation threatens all the least protected groups, including minors, with a negative impact on their economic, social and cultural future. This report addresses, in a comprehensive overview, an issue which, in just a few years, has profoundly changed the life of minors in the European Union. Harmful online content, with strong connotations of violence, discrimination, sexism, racism, with features that are such as to be unsuitable for minors, can diminish, in unprepared users, the perception of the offence to human dignity and facilitate among minors the use of the internet with intentions that are more or less knowingly harmful of their personal dignity and that of others. I think it is essential for Member States to agree to protect minors in the digital world also by promoting complete mastery of its forms, which is essential for full and active citizenship, to offer European citizens the chance of benefitting from the cultural and economic dimension of all types of media connected to digital technology and to contribute to the realisation of the Lisbon goals, favouring the emergence of a knowledge-based economy and stimulating competition.</p>

On this International Children’s Rights Day, the European Parliament passed by a large majority a resolution on the protection of children in the digital world against the risks of violence, fraud, child pornography and sexual harassment which children may encounter on the internet. Our resolution strongly asks States to make additional efforts to combat illegal and harmful content on the internet, to minimise the risks of internet use for children, while insisting on the importance of educating children in the new digital media.

We should have better resources for reporting the illegal content and abusive behaviour present on the web and for promoting better cooperation with the police forces and the judicial services for minors. Furthermore, tools such as parental control, filtering software and age verification systems must also be used better.

One of the main objectives of an effective child protection strategy should be to ensure that all children, young people and parents/carers are provided with the information and skills to be able to protect themselves online.

It is important that schools keep abreast of changes in the digital world. Schools must instruct children and young people in the practical, safe and critical use of digital technology and the internet. As schools and teaching take on an increasingly digital aspect, it must be ensured that the know-how of teachers also remains at the level required by today’s world. I would like to express my thanks to Ms Costa for this comprehensive and commendable report, which on the one hand highlights the opportunities of digital technology relating to school life and teaching, but on the other hand reminds us of the dangers faced by children and young people in an online environment. Minors are capable of using the internet with ease, but to use it sensibly and responsibly they often require help. Child protection, especially the protection of privacy and the combating of unsuitable content, is of primary importance.

      <p sl="it">The Member States continue to promote children’s access to the digital world, through actions and policies to access the internet, govern its content and respect privacy. Self-regulation of content has been encouraged through the Safer Internet Programme, created with EU cofinancing, which is well established in all the countries of the Union and which, until 2013, will guarantee general coordination. Aware of the cultural and legal differences among Member States, on the basis of which it is hard to establish a boundary between content and conduct to be penalised and those ‘grey’ areas, we propose distinguishing illegal content from conduct which can have serious consequences and unsuitable conduct for the age. In my opinion it is therefore necessary to ensure continuity for the Safer Internet Programme and in any case to guarantee that the responsibility for protecting minors against cybercrime is held by the police, in an increasingly efficient and cooperative form at European level. Self-regulation has proven to be a useful path, but has demonstrated limits that must be corrected.

Children are using the internet at a very young age, even before going to school or learning to read and write. These young internet users are then exposed to numerous risks, such as child pornography and sexual exploitation, which must be tackled at European level. Just as it is impossible to keep an eye on all the ‘perverts’ using the internet, it is also very difficult for parents to monitor everything their child does. In digital terms, children reach the age of majority well before 18 years of age and changes in family lifestyles mean that teenagers, often left to their own devices or at home alone after school, are receiving some form of sexual solicitation much more frequently than before. That is why parents, teachers, civil society, internet service providers, businesses and public authorities must work together to protect children from online abuse and crime.

Children are much more exposed and vulnerable to being the victims of scams and abuse, and that is why they are expressly protected, as Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union clearly states.

Information on the internet inevitably has two effects on minors. On the one hand, the internet, as a knowledge source, has an educational function; on the other hand, it causes harm through illegal content that can have serious effects on children’s and teenagers’ development. Sexual content, encountered by a large percentage of minors, whether accidentally or intentionally, is of particular concern. Responsible growth of knowledge-based society is the principle that we should follow when it comes to the protection of children and teenagers in the virtual world. At the same time, particular attention should be paid to the closest environment for children, the family, and the responsibility that it has to raise responsible citizens. Education and prevention should start at family level.

      <p sl="it">The data speak loud and clear: Europe’s children are online starting on average at 9 years of age, but in some very precocious cases, even before they start schooling and reading. A total of 38 % of young people aged 9 to 12 and 77 % aged 15 and 16 are registered on a social network. In their profile, 16 % use a fictitious profile and 27 % of 9 to 12 year-olds declare an older age than their real one, and state that they find it easier to express themselves online rather than face to face. In the light of these startling facts, we should highlight how these inexperienced and naïve web surfers are constant victims of child pornography, violation of privacy and commercial fraud. We therefore need to ensure continuity for the Safer Internet Programme so that responsibility for protecting minors against cybercrime is held by the police, in an increasingly efficient and cooperative form at European level. In the light of what I have briefly explained, I voted in favour of the proposal.</p>

That is why I am delighted that the European Parliament has adopted this resolution on protecting children in the digital world this afternoon. The revolution that is the internet is playing an increasingly important role in most families and parents often find themselves disconcerted by the fact their children are so ‘advanced’ when it comes to technology. In digital terms, children reach the age of majority well before 18 years of age. Young internet users are being exposed at an increasingly young age to dangers in digital form, such as violent games and videos, but even more importantly to the risk of coming into contact with perverts and, possibly, members of child pornography networks. It is, of course, impossible to monitor every internet user, just as it is to ask parents to keep tabs on everything their child looks at on the internet, but we need a holistic approach. Parents, teachers, internet providers, businesses, public authorities and safeguarding agencies need to work together to provide the best possible protection for children, who are particularly vulnerable and exposed to the most serious of abuses on the internet and social networks.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In Europe it is becoming commonplace for children to go online. A study showed that in the EU, nearly all children aged between 9 and 16 use a computer to play games or do their homework. While the internet may play a role in furthering education and development, it also exposes children to risks, through phenomena such as pornography, the exchange of material on violence, or cybercrime, of which parents are usually unaware. By voting in favour of this resolution, I am calling for children to be better protected in the digital world. In particular, I am supportive of the additional technological options that prevent children from accessing age-inappropriate content (parental controls, age verification systems, etc.). I believe it is crucial that children, parents and educators are better informed about the use of new digital media. I also believe better coordination at European level is essential in terms of points of contact, such as hotlines for reporting illegal content or abusive conduct, in addition to greater cooperation with third countries as regards the prompt deletion of web pages containing or disseminating illegal content or behaviour hosted in their territory.</p>

This report draws on the Communication of May 2012 ‘European Strategy for a better internet for children’ and aims at delivering an answer to the results of a survey in the Member States on the use of the internet by minors. In its draft version, as presented in CULT, the report focused on the fear that inexperienced and naive web surfers - among them minors - are in danger of being exposed to all sorts of abuses, especially child pornography, while parents and schools, overwhelmed by technological developments, have difficulty accompanying young people in their ‘exploration of the digital world’ Therefore, Ms Costa insisted in her draft text on the implementation of legal measures, mixed with recommendations for stronger rules, harmonisation of systems within the EU, responsibility-sharing with internet providers, and also - but not strongly enough - on education. Finally the consolidated version remains a mix between a certain demonisation of internet (e.g. recitals A and N) and a statement of the opportunities opened to children and all potential consumers (e.g. recital I, Articles 15 and 16).</p>

However, the report’s focus on government campaigns and the extension of enforcement to ISPs and other self-regulating mechanisms is setting the wrong priorities and risks privatising responsibilities that lie in the hands of states, while diminishing the role of parents in their children’s education. Measures included in the report furthermore demonstrate an unwarranted bias towards the perceived dangers of the internet, limiting the opportunities for education and innovation. Rather, I prefer to strengthen young people’s resilience and independence. Efforts should be directed at educating children and young people, with the help of their parents and teachers, to take ownership of their actions on the web and to develop e-skills. I recognise that advancements in ICT can raise social capital, facilitating fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and access to information. I consider the participation of children and youth in today’s digital society an essential aspect of their development. While fully recognising the need for effective law enforcement, particularly the need to end serious crimes such as child pornography, I regret the restrictive nature of the proposed measures prevents me from giving my support.</p>

The first issue we need to address is that of the digital divide and in particular the protection of the least-protected groups, including minors. The adoption of the report on protecting children in the digital world lays the foundations for a more organic framework directive that includes all the measures concerning children in previous EU legislation. It is undoubtedly necessary to encourage action to combat online crime, which has been successfully adopted by some Member States. But the cultural and legal differences among Member States make it hard to establish clearly which content should be penalised. Self-regulation adopted so far has proven useful, but has demonstrated limits that must be corrected with a unified framework of rights that tackles conduct that could have serious consequences for young Europeans.

From a very young age children are able to very skilfully navigate the technology and their access to it is almost unlimited.

It is therefore necessary to take measures in order to protect our children from illegal online content, abuse of minors, violent advertising, and the risks that they are faced with every day by means of the digital world. The Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, together with the now legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, whose Article 24 defines the protection of children as a fundamental right and provides that in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the child’s best interests must be a primary consideration.

Children should be making the greatest use of the internet for study purposes. They should use it to glean knowledge about the world, and also to acquire the new capabilities which are essential to successful functioning in the 21st century.

The objective of the Report is to achieve social impact rather than generating profit for owners and shareholders which operates in the market through the production of goods and services in an entrepreneurial and innovative way and which is managed by social entrepreneurs in an accountable and transparent way, in particular by involving workers, customers and stakeholders affected by its business activity. With this initiative will be possible to facilitate social and work integration, improving the quality of social and healthcare contributing to inclusive growth. Moreover, it is very important to give the possibility to the youth to have an environment and the opportunity to start their one social business. We have to raise awareness for all Europeans on the regional, social, structural and cohesion funds that Europe provides to his citizens. The acquisition of this fund should be easier and for everyone. EU Structural Funds programs and exercises a significant role in facilitating access to finance for enterprises in the social economy. The access to European funds should be simplified, allowing the establishment of an appropriate level of flexibility to the Member States.</p>

I would like to begin by acknowledging the work of all these institutions in minimising the negative impacts of the crisis – we are aware of its consequences but have not paid much attention to problems of a social nature – as well as the contribution that they have made to help Europe emerge from this. These enterprises, the aim of which is not immediate profit but improvement in the living conditions of the most vulnerable classes, currently represent 6 % of all European Union workers, many of whom are young people. The Europe 2020 strategy should respond to the lack of social services given the ongoing demographic trends and an ageing population. This is a sector that deserves our full support and therefore should benefit from a special tax regime to have easier access to funding.

We oppose this view. It does not concern just the support of this wonderful entrepreneurship as a panacea for the crisis, concealing its true causes – the unequal distribution of wealth, increased exploitation of labour, unemployment, recessionary policies. The report goes further and sees the replacement of public services, which are people’s rights, by services rendered by these social enterprises as something positive, thus transforming rights into business opportunities. On the way, it promotes precarious work, advocating that workers be hired on a voluntary basis, ‘for the young who are beginning their careers, and for the elderly in order to share competencies’.

These areas of this work are far from complete, however, as the concept of social enterprise needs further clarification along with a precise mapping of related activities, the role of those participating in social enterprises has to be defined and we need to present potential business models based on which social enterprises can operate in Europe.

I am pleased that the Commission has acknowledged this in its announcement and has proposed an action plan, because in my view one must support business types with such significant potential. I consequently supported the report by Parliament on this issue. As an advisor for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I have concentrated chiefly on issues linked to consumers and public procurement. The role of consumers in the development of social enterprise cannot be overestimated. It is precisely consumers making choices on where they purchase products or which company’s services they make use of that make or break businesses. Consumers are often not aware of the benefits that come with social enterprises, however. It also happens that consumers do not trust businesses of this type. I am therefore of the opinion that the European Union should take steps to raise the level of consumer confidence in social enterprises and encourage consumers to give active support to such businesses. Where public procurement is concerned, it is my view that countering social exclusion by providing easier access to procurement for entities from vulnerable social groups is an aspect that must be supported, with the principles of a free market in mind, of course.</p>

Investing in social enterprise can bring significant returns, not only in strictly economic terms – wealth creation and employment potential – but also from a social point of view. The added value of social enterprise is represented by the pursuit of goals such as social inclusion, re-entry into the employment market, the provision of services to the community and to people who are most marginalised and at risk of exclusion. I also support Mr Becker’s approach to ensuring that social enterprises are not exposed to uncontrolled competition and benefit from adequate financial support. In this regard I hope that appropriate measures are taken to make it easier for these enterprises to access microcredit. Social enterprise will also be particularly instrumental in accelerating social and territorial cohesion in some parts of Europe where development is lagging behind. Social enterprises will feed into a ‘virtuous circle’ through the production of goods and supply of services of a social nature, the stimulus to create new production models and the spread of entrepreneurship and a culture of legality.</p>

      <p sl="en">I have voted in favour of the Social Business Initiative – Creating a favourable climate for social enterprises, key stakeholders in the social economy and innovation (2012/2004(INI)) as it provides our communities with the necessary resources to not only boost local and national economies but more importantly allows for a platform to assist our citizens. This initiative clearly seeks to anchor precise, clear and open general conditions for the next phase of the European social economy that will afford new opportunities. It is through this that many benefits can and will be gained in the following phase. In addition the initiative will help to develop orderly framework conditions and action plans that should leave room for diversity and plurality where these already exist, or establish them if they have been lacking so far. Finally I would like to say that by implementing the measures in this document we will be better suited to ‘spread the wealth’ so to speak, meaning that enterprises will not be able to focus on just one location to increase their profits but will be welcome to spread out to rural areas and gain the same benefits as those located in large cities.</p>

However, this report contains several points which we directly oppose. Firstly, it considers the entrepreneurship paradigm as a solution to the crisis when we know that the recessive policies of capital accumulation have prevented and hindered job creation. Moreover, the report takes a positive view of the replacement of social services, that is, public services which are people’s rights, by services rendered by social enterprises, thus transforming rights into business opportunities. It also promotes precarious work by advocating that workers be hired on a voluntary basis, ‘for the young who are beginning their careers, and for the elderly in order to share competencies’.

The European Parliament wants a thorough overhaul of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in all its aspects.

It is essential that democratic control matches the pace of reforms and, across the board, the European Parliament, as the Institution that represents all citizens, should play a key role. We, Members of the European Parliament, underlined that the goals of a stronger economic union should be sustainable economic growth, more jobs and greater social cohesion. Completing the internal market, implementing existing internal market law, implementing the 2020 Strategy for Growth and Jobs and a targeted use of European budgets are key issues which should be put in place without further delay.</p>

      <p sl="hu">At its plenary sitting in Strasbourg today the European Parliament voted for a draft report that would create tighter fiscal discipline in the European Union and take specific steps towards the establishment of a banking union. The Thyssen report on ‘Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union’ was created in response to decisions made at the June summit of the European Council. The document highlights that the financial markets have become increasingly fragmented in recent years, their activities have become complex, and this situation has contributed significantly to the financial, economic and social crisis which emerged and still continues in Europe today. This is why it is vital not only for there to be Member State economic policies and fiscal austerity measures coordinated at EU level, but also for the Union to have a supervisory framework that is capable of covering, forecasting and under certain circumstances managing systemic risks. The new structure would create a more predictable regulatory environment and redress the imbalanced financial situation between banks and sovereign debts, whilst restoring confidence in the financial market.

The proposal is based on four key pillars: banking, fiscal and economic union and the strengthening of its democratic legitimacy and accountability, including proposals such as the establishment of a Single Supervisory Mechanism, the strengthening of tax harmonisation and the decisive implementation of structural reforms in the economy.

That is why I believe a social pact is fundamental. The idea is that the EU should be founded on a fifth pillar in addition to the four highlighted by the report of the Presidents. During this crisis, the EU has neglected action on social issues. Binding regulations on budgetary discipline and surveillance of economic and budgetary policies must be accompanied by regulations governing labour and social issues. That is why we are calling for a European social pact, to promote decent living wages in particular, and for the implementation of a social protocol to protect fundamental social and labour rights. People who have been hit hard by the crisis and its social impact need something more than austerity budgets and hardship. The EU has to prove where its added value lies and find its way again.</p>

Between 2008 and mid-2012, the EU-27 unemployment rate has climbed from around 7 % to 10.4 %, or 25 million unemployed and more than one out of five young people is unemployed (22 %), with youth unemployment exceeding 50 % in some Member States. The European Union is at a crossroads and a clear direction needs to be chosen either to combine forces within the Union and to build a future for a strong and value-driven and solidarity-based Union in a globalised world, or to fold back on itself and be forced to passively adapt to globalisation.

It is equally important that the European Parliament is more closely involved in the implementation of economic and monetary policy.

Before this report was discussed and voted on, a committee of three representatives of Parliament (appointed, not elected) took a position on behalf of Parliament on various aspects. These positions formed the basis of this report and the final compromise solutions. A peculiar exercise in democracy by this Parliament. As far as the key issue is concerned, the consequences of this Economic and Monetary Union are plain for all to see, as it has been responsible for unsustainable imbalances and differences between Member States and has been the instrument for deepening neoliberalism in Europe. But those who have benefited from it do not now want to let it go. As on other occasions, a new step legitimises the previous one and justifies the following. As far as we are concerned, our profound disagreement with the EMU is well-known, and for which there is no possible reform. Strengthening the EMU will lead to greater destruction of the manufacturing bases of countries with weaker economies and will heighten production deficits that will generate greater budgetary deficits and growing public debt.

      <p sl="hu">The initiative aimed at a genuine economic and monetary union links in well with the economic-policy measures of the EU so far, as alongside Member State and fiscal discipline, the supervision of banks will now be included in the common economic and monetary policy. This initiative is extremely important for Member States outside the euro area as well since the national supervision frameworks of banks have so far proved insufficient in shackling the economic crisis. I believe it is important that when the new banking supervision system is established we must ensure that Hungary is able to join this common supervisory system with equal rights and obligations.</p>

There are two choices. Either go for full fiscal and political union or allow the euro area to shrink by letting the weaker Member States leave. Letting Greece leave the euro area is still too big a psychological blow for the political elites who see the euro as an essential building block towards the European Project of a federal republic of Europe. That’s why euro area leaders are continuing to forge an ‘ever closer union’. Having transformed their economy by going through painful economic reform, my German friends tell me they resent subsidising what they see as the less productive countries but a sustainable monetary union requires fiscal transfers from taxpayers in richer countries to governments in less productive countries. The solution may come from the ECB printing money which debases the euro but allows banks to buy sovereign debt and when they go bust doing so, they will be bailed out by the ESM. Who funds the ESM? Germany, the Netherlands and Finland and ‘Hey Presto’ we have fiscal transfers by the back door!</p>

To that end, as soon as possible, we need to focus our efforts in the following directions: 1. increasing existing traditional own resources; 2. introducing new own resources, such as the financial transaction tax and the common consolidated corporate tax base, and finding other innovative methods of generating a stimulus for the financial sector; 3.

Member States are to be excluded from having a say as far as possible. It is a complete misjudgment of the situation, as since May 2010 it has been absolutely clear that a monetary union between countries with different economic orientations and strengths and different cultural perceptions, particularly as far as fiscal policy is concerned, is not sensible. The seemingly simple answer of the EU establishment, to call for greater centralisation everywhere and at all times, therefore misjudges the situation entirely. The report does contain something positive, however: with its call for ‘necessary Treaty changes in order to guarantee legal certainty and democratic legitimacy’ it confirms that the measures taken to date, bilateral loans to Greece, the European Financial Stability Facility, the European Stability Mechanism and the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme, are not covered by the EU Treaty and therefore were and remain illegal!

I consider the Thyssen report ‘Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union’ to be one of the most important reports adopted by the European Parliament on European integration since the start of the banking crisis in 2008, which then became the economic and then budgetary crisis in several countries and which has put the solidity of the European Union to the test. 2. The key message of the report is that the crisis arose and developed in large part due to a lack of European integration in the construction of the European and Monetary Union (EMU) and that the solution to the crisis is a genuine EMU in all its dimensions – fiscal, economic and banking union – and the strengthening of the social and political pillar of European integration. The problems of integration can only be overcome by more integration. I also note that this time the report has not ignored the need to limit competition and dumping tax within the EU, since it is from the outset contrary to the logic of the internal market. As such the report deserves the broad support it has received and deserves to be considered as a reference for the future.</p>

During its relatively short history the European Union has made a significant shift towards political, economic, fiscal and monetary integration. Between 2008 and mid-2012, the EU-27 unemployment rate climbed from around 7 % to 10.4 %, or 25 million unemployed. More than 1 in 5 young people are unemployed (22 %), with youth unemployment exceeding 50 % in some Member States. The latest Eurobarometer research indicates that for reason of the persisting crisis there has been a sharp decline in trust in political institutions both at national and at Union level. The Union remains the actor that Union citizens feel is the most effective in tackling the economic crisis. The economic and monetary union is an instrument to achieve the objectives of the Union and the Member States, in particular balanced and sustainable growth and a high level of employment. Social inclusion and solidarity are the cornerstones of the European social model and cannot be left out of any future reform of the Union.</p>

Nevertheless, the role of Parliament in future should be still more distinct, and specifically the President of the European Parliament should be part of the team drafting a roadmap for reform of the economic and monetary union. I would also like to emphasise that interested entities means not only institutions, but also Member States, and above all euro area countries and those covered by a temporary derogation from accession to currency union. Parliament’s report is a good instrument which contains a number of sagacious demands such as the call to create a banking union based on three pillars and to deepen the internal market. We are also emphasising that the Fiscal Compact should be transposed into secondary legislation and that economic policy should be more effectively harmonised. Despite reference being made to many important structural principles, there continues to be a lack of a clear vision of responsibility management – particularly in the case of banking union. It is hard to see decision making being transferred to the level of common European authorities while at the same time maintaining national fiscal responsibility for the results of such decisions as a way of bringing about financial stability.</p>

By contrast, improvement in the deposit guarantee scheme is an absolutely necessary step and will bring the desired stability. Nevertheless, any modernisation of the deposit guarantee rules should be based on the existing national schemes. Mandatory lending between national deposit guarantee schemes, as proposed by the European Commission, would, however, expose the European economy to an increased risk of destabilisation. The need to improve the current democratic deficit in the European decision-making process is significant; in other words, the European Parliament should be fully involved in the review of all the planned steps.

A future European finance minister must be individually accountable to the European Parliament.

The European Semester, the procedure in which the financial and economic policy of the EU countries is checked, must be democratised. Parliament must gain control over the guidelines that the Commission operates. National parliaments must discuss beforehand the reform plans that their governments submit to the Commission. The reforms, cutbacks and investments which governments undertake to carry out within the European Semester must be more strictly checked with regard to their effects on jobs and social protection.

This path worsens the people’s problems and prepares the way for the next crisis, which will come much sooner than the political mouthpieces of capital expect. Here is the proof of how dangerous those delusions are: the delusions spread by the parties of capital and the European one-way street, that the EU can change and that there can be populist administration within the EU, under conditions of domination by the monopolies. A populist way out of the crisis presupposes disengagement from the EU, unilateral debt cancellation for the debt-burdened capitalist countries, and socialisation of the monopolies through people’s power and a people’s economy.</p>

      <p sl="lv">As the European Union’s economic and monetary ties become closer, it is important to coordinate the creation of Member States’ economic policy. It is equally important for the institutions that carry out the work of monetary union to be transparent and subject to democratic scrutiny. At the same time, I cannot agree with most of the sections included in the action plan.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Firstly, a gradual roll-over into a redemption fund which would store the debt of a state which exceeds 60 % of individual euro area Member States’ GDP would reduce the individual responsibility of the states. Already it is clear that some Member States are unable to carry out the required legislative alignment in order to reduce national foreign debt. The creation of a joint fund will not encourage the repayment of debts.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Secondly, I do not support the long-term plan on the common issuance of debt in the euro area. Eurobonds would allow the weaker states to continue to borrow and spend, while at the same time increasing borrowing costs for the remaining states, which are adhering to the EU’s fiscal conditions.</p>

Those who on the basis of deceit and lies allowed completely unsuitable countries into the euro area have learned nothing from their mistakes. The question remains of whether it is logical or even practically possible for countries with very different labour markets and very different political inclinations or social and fiscal traditions to be squeezed into a straitjacket. We have experience of this in Belgium and there are only two peoples there. For that reason I have not approved this report.

The repetition and reaffirmation of these well-worn phrases does not bode well for Europeans, particularly those worst off, and will not help Europe out of the crisis but instead have quite the opposite effect, as stated by a growing number of economists. It risks plunging Europe back into recession and dragging a number of other countries with it. The European Parliament has missed a unique opportunity to give its view on a process from which it was completely removed. Therefore I voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="lv">This own-initiative report drafted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, together with the recommendations attached to it, point in the right direction for a more integrated euro area and European Union. Although banking union, the first stage in approaching genuine economic and monetary union, is encountering difficulties and the interests and prejudices of various states are becoming increasingly prominent, these ought not to be reasons for not striving for such an ambitious system. With its help, it will be possible to resolve the current crisis and to prevent the recurrence of similar crises in the future.</p>
      <p sl="lv">In addition to a single supervisory mechanism for banks we must also rapidly reach agreement on a common deposit guarantee fund and other mechanisms – and thus also on a sufficient EU budget with which to fund these. Member States which have prejudices against unequal expenditure in connection with mechanisms for resolving the crisis ought to acknowledge that all states have enjoyed the benefits of the single market and single currency and that it is only fair, in difficult times, for all states to assume responsibility. Similarly, we must look at the EU’s banking sector as a whole, taking into account the fact that it involves cross-border activities.</p>
      <p sl="lv">A solid mechanism for solving banks’ problems, financed by credit institutions, is the right way to ensure that insolvency on the part of banks will not result in states becoming insolvent.

The reality here demonstrates that, contrary to the propaganda surrounding the euro and the EMU – and the EU itself – these instruments have not only been shown not to be a shield against the crisis or a weapon with which to confront capitalist globalisation, but also have very clearly shown their instrumental nature in the accumulation of profits by capitalist monopolies. There is no solution nor reform possible for the EMU. Strengthening the EMU will lead to greater destruction of the manufacturing bases of countries with weaker economies and will enhance production deficits that will generate greater budgetary deficits and growing public debt. What is required is an immediate radical change in its statutes and guidelines, as well as the fake regime of independence of the European Central Bank (ECB), to guarantee the equitable participation of States represented on its board, in order to ensure, firstly, effective political control of the ECB by Member States and, secondly, the control of each participating State over its own national central bank and its national monetary policy, with a view to promoting economic growth and employment.</p>

It is an evaluation of the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in the past year. The rapporteur is concerned over the fall in the participation of MEPs in the meetings of the JPA’s specialised committees. This is a real problem, the causes of which need further study. At various times we have stressed the importance of the JPA as a space for sharing experiences and joint reflection which can greatly enhance cooperation with the ACP countries. While the report does not say so, JPA meetings clashing with other parliamentary activities (whether committee meetings or plenary sessions) is one of the factors that has limited participation. Such clashes should be avoided in the future. The rapporteur expresses concern over budget cuts in EU Member States affecting development policies and calls on the JPA to maintain its pressure on EU Member States to meet their 0.7 % gross national income target by 2015. This is a fair and relevant concern, which we support.

However, the main problem with the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is the eye-watering cost of its meetings. Earlier this year, it was revealed by a British newspaper that the Joint Assembly’s meetings in Kinshasa and Tenerife had been Parliament’s most expensive trips by parliamentary delegations in 2010. Over EUR 1 million was spent on the meeting in Kinshasa. For 50 MEPs this worked out at over EUR 20 000 per head. The meeting in Tenerife cost over EUR 700 000 with a per head price tag of over EUR 10 000. If the Joint Assembly is to remain a relevant player in relations between the EU and the ACP it needs to lose its reputation for political tourism. Parliament needs to make meaningful cuts to its budget. If we do not cut the budget of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly we are letting down citizens both at home and abroad.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I must return once again to the speech I made prior to voting time, on the basis of Article 6(1) of our rules on the use of Parliamentary premises. In these rules Parliament has come to an agreement that Parliamentary premises may not be used by companies pursuing economic interests that are directly connected to controversial votes linked to the economic interests of these companies. I fear that we have an exhibition on shale gas directly outside the Chamber that is incompatible with Article 6(1) of these rules. I ask the Bureau to clarify this immediately.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I have checked whether the Citizens’ Initiative For Responsible Energy – this is the sign being used for this exhibition on shale gas – is included in our register of lobby groups. I cannot find this Citizens’ Initiative there. We drew up the register of lobby groups to create transparency in the area of lobbying. Every single one of the companies behind this Citizens’ Initiative is a firm with significant economic interests in Poland and in the field of shale gas. I would like to propose once again that either this exhibition be removed or that this Citizens’ Initiative sign be replaced immediately with the signs of the companies behind the Citizens’ Initiative.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to appeal to the hosts of this exhibition, Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Protasiewicz, to support this initiative, as it is in keeping with the transparency rules set by this Parliament that such exhibitions do not take place in this form.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, over the course of the many months I spent working on the report, I familiarised myself with the results of many expert appraisals carried out by scientists, engineers, practitioners and officials. My objective was to present a report which has not been written from behind a desk, but which provides a practical presentation and discussion of all aspects of the process of extracting this raw material and the technology that is used to achieve this. I visited sites where drilling for shale gas is taking place and I talked to politicians, ecologists and representatives of local communities. The experience I gathered has been reflected in my draft report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased that it was possible to arrive at a balanced compromise in my committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, where the shadow rapporteurs shared my cautious approach, which places the emphasis on the highest environmental standards and tough requirements, but at the same time gives shale gas a chance, a chance for extraction to be commercially viable. Europe simply cannot afford not to make use of its own resources, which may not only help to reduce dependence on external supplies and improve EU energy security, but at the same time play a part in the policy of reducing emissions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The main plank of my report is the reiterated calls for a review of current legislation at EU and national level, better implementation of existing legislation, creation of a catalogue of best available technologies and best industry practices, the highest technical standards, ongoing monitoring, full transparency of actions and liability of operators. One standard that should be beyond question is that of the duty to declare the chemical composition of hydraulic fluids in line with REACH, minimisation of water consumption during the fracturing process, effective recycling of flow-back water and chemicals and careful selection of well-bore sites.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It must not be forgotten that the success of the whole project will be decided by social acceptance and the consent of citizens. Continuous dialogue with the local population and a pan-European information and education campaign must therefore be guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Shale gas, then, is a fuel which may be extracted and should be extracted in Europe. Successful commercialisation of unconventional gas has made the United States an exporter of this raw material with a potential that exceeds that of Russia. Europe is also faced with an opportunity to increase its independence from external supplies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Communication from the Commission on planned action in the energy sphere up to 2050 (Energy Roadmap 2050) states that gas will be critical for the transformation of the power generation system by helping to limit emissions, and that will undoubtedly be the case. In my view, a debate on this issue is needed at European level, and work needs to be done to establish fixed principles for cooperation and compromise in this area, but compromise based on facts and scientific results, compromise that would dismiss demagogy and a priori warnings that have been voiced on certain subjects.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is in this context that I would like to appeal to all Members to reject the amendment which wrecks this compromise, an amendment which calls for a ban, and which imposes a moratorium on the use of fracking technology. Let a clear voice be heard from the European Parliament in tomorrow’s vote on the two reports on shale gas, saying that shale gas extraction is safe for the environment and for public health on condition that the highest environmental and safety standards are observed, and each Member State may make its own sovereign choice as to whether it wishes to make use of the potential which extraction of unconventional mineral fuels provides.</p>

    <intervention id="2-458-000" speaker_id="96660" name="Niki Tzavela" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, Europe has the longest history in the world of the pursuit of progress and democracy. It was because of those European men and women who boldly and bravely paved the way for the exploration and exploitation of the continent’s resources that Europe became one of the leading powers in politics and economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Shale gas gives us all the opportunity to prove that our generation of politicians considers the continent’s natural resources and wealth as a challenge for growth and not as a threat. The recent evolution in the European context of shale gas developments suggests a growing need for a clear, predictable and coherent approach to unconventional fossil fuels. This is how we reach optimal decisions in an area involving social and environmental issues, industrial competitiveness and, in particular, public trust.</p>
      <p sl="en">Based on American experience – because we do not have any European experience on this – shale gas is potentially the biggest energy development since the 1920s, as big a change as when we switched from using coal to oil. The shale gas-related developments in the USA will have a profound impact on global energy demand and geopolitics. The US has already surpassed Russia as the world’s largest gas producer and the price of gas in the US has collapsed, making the price in the US between USD 3 and 4 per unit, while in Europe the price is USD 10-14.</p>
      <p sl="en">A European single market for gas has been a concept we have been hearing about from the Commission for some time now. One of the key and legitimate concerns of the European energy liberalisation project was that liberalisation would have limited effect unless there were new sources of gas. If states were still largely dependent on the same external suppliers for their gas liberalisation, a single market would not prosper.</p>
      <p sl="en">Shale gas could add a new dynamic to the European gas market. This in turn could lead to increasing global gas to gas competition, having a major effect on prices and avoiding indexation to oil prices. With a correct safety approach, highest safety standards and the application of best available technologies, shale gas could be a huge gain to EU energy security and diversity, as well as a potential contributing factor to Europe’s reindustrialisation in the years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe needs a vision and a clear message of how gas fits into its energy policy. Whether we use shale gas or not, in as little time as we have been hearing about it we have already been witnesses to its significance as a global energy trendsetter for markets, energy demand and cost partners. Shale gas is perhaps not the panacea for Europe’s energy problems overall. Unconventional fuels are still at an infant stage in Europe and we should explore the options available and the possible benefits as rigorously as we examine and analyse the potential environmental effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Commission’s side, coordination between DG Energy, DG Enterprise, DG Environment and DG Climate Action will now be vital as you take this forward. Commissioners, I wish you good luck for the sake, the goodwill and the survival of European citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="2-459-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is a rare opportunity to present some of the proposals together with a fellow-Commissioner. First, I would like to say that I wish, on behalf of the Commission, to thank Mr Sonik and also Ms Tzavela, as well as all the Members who have contributed to the development of this very comprehensive report. I will, of course, concentrate more on the report by Mr Sonik.</p>
      <p sl="en">The initiative is very timely. As the report recognises, technological advancements have spurred a rapid commercial development of unconventional fossil fuels, especially shale gas, in certain parts of the world. Up to now, most of this has been outside Europe. Inside the European Union resource potentials are still subject to considerable uncertainty. As captured well in your report, public concerns over health and environmental risks have led a number of Member States to consider adapting their national legislation to deal with shale gas projects. Certain Member States have already postponed permitting decisions and some have even adopted bans. It is clear that the future development of shale gas will depend on the extent of public acceptance of fracking. Unless environmental and health risks are addressed in a proper way, and people are convinced that they are, then the development of this industry will not last. We need to face up to this issue and we need to face up to this issue now.</p>
      <p sl="en">These risks are also the main focus in your report. It has identified the most salient issues calling for close follow-up, including a number of uncertainties or gaps in current EU legislation. Similar issues were also covered in the study which we released in September. I have discussed these issues in depth with my colleagues Günther Oettinger, who is sitting here next to me, and of course also Connie Hedegaard, and the Commission has now included in its work programme for next year, 2013, a new initiative that will strive to provide maximum legal clarity and predictability for market operators and citizens and prevent, reduce and manage climate and environmental risks in line with public expectations and in a harmonised manner across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect I am happy to see that our ideas are converging. The Commission’s impact assessment is already looking at options to manage risks and to address regulatory shortcomings. It will take into account the findings from recent studies released by the Commission and the Member States, as well as risk control measures put forward also in your report. We will assess how to prevent surface and sub-surface risks, to adopt monitoring, reporting and transparency requirements and finally to clarify the EU regulatory framework and remove potential obstacles with regard to both exploration and extraction activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I believe that we can meet the essence of your requests through the actions that we are implementing or planning. We look forward to engaging with Parliament in the follow-up of this truly important initiative. I am also very much looking forward to today’s debate and will try to answer as many of your questions as possible at the end.</p>

    <intervention id="2-460-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, to add to the comments of my colleague Mr Potočnik, I would also like to thank the two committees and the two responsible MEPs for the reports, which highlight the diversity of the issue of unconventional gas and oil energy resources, in particular shale gas. This is an issue that involves environmental protection and climate-related aspects, energy policy and industrial aspects, as well as social issues. The three studies carried out on behalf of the Commission, which we published a few weeks ago and are now analysing, form a parallel basis that will enable us to conduct a comprehensive consultation and arrive at a conclusion within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not deceive ourselves: as for many other issues related to energy policy, there was also a broad range of opinions and interests in the area of shale gas. Some Member States are categorically against it, others have moratoriums in place and certain countries see shale gas as something that can make an important contribution to resolving the question of their energy independence.</p>
      <p sl="de">The change in the United States is a far-reaching one: the Americans are largely independent of gas imports and will be able to decide whether they are even in a position to export gas. The gas price in the United States is currently only around a quarter to a third of the price being paid on the European Union’s gas markets. Shale gas provides flexibility and makes it possible to move away from long-term supply contracts with high gas prices linked to the global market price of oil, and US production is also indirectly bringing about a change on the global market: large quantities of LNG that were previously transported by ship to the United States from Nigeria and Qatar have now been freed up. This LNG is being integrated to a greater extent into the energy strategies of Japan – following the shutdown of nuclear power stations in the aftermath of Fukushima – and also Europe, with its existing and planned LNG terminals.</p>
      <p sl="de">From our perspective, for the European gas market it is inconceivable for a number of reasons that shale gas will cover all of our gas requirements: all the initial analyses have shown that our deposits are considerably smaller and the costs of production here are higher. It is also clear that the European Union’s dense population of 500 million people will reduce the potential compared with that of the United States, whose deposits in some cases are in sparsely populated regions and states, even if it does not eliminate this potential altogether. Questions of acceptance also come into the equation.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason we will steadfastly continue to develop our policy of completing the internal energy market in order to increase security of supply, further expand renewable energies and drive forward energy efficiency in an effective way. Shale gas will not replace the internal market, energy efficiency or renewable energy sources, but it can complement them.</p>
      <p sl="de">At present we have a gas market within the EU with an annual consumption of around 540 billion cubic metres. A third of our resources are produced within the European Union, namely in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Over the next 15 to 20 years this potential, these production volumes, will decline markedly. One opportunity may be for shale gas to replace some of the existing conventional production volumes, so that every cubic metre that we previously produced in Europe does not have to be imported into Europe on a one-for-one basis in the future. In this respect shale gas could contribute to our objective of diversification.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the moment only a small amount of test drilling has been carried out in the Member States. For that reason we will firmly support demonstration projects. We need more reliable information on the quantities of gas and on exploration costs.</p>
      <p sl="de">One fascinating question will be whether European legislation will be necessary, that is to say whether – something for which Mr Potočnik will be responsible – the regulatory framework for the protection of groundwater and surface water, soil, the countryside and the natural environment that exists at European level is sufficient or whether supplementary European legislation will be needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its work programme for 2013 the Commission has deliberately included an initiative for which several Commissioners are responsible – Mr Potočnik, Ms Hedegaard, Mr Tajani, Mr Barnier and myself – that will deal with the relevant environmental, climate protection, energy and industrial aspects. We are particularly interested in the dialogue that you have started today, in the points you have raised, in your opinions and in the extremely objective reports of the two committees, which will provide a basis for the conclusions to be reached together next year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs I would like to point out once again what the results of its deliberations were: firstly, I refer to the fact that the existing Environmental Impact Assessment Directives, Mining Waste Directive, Seveso II Directive, Habitats Directive, and so on, do of course apply.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I wish to mention the forecasts made 10 years ago, according to which today, in 2012, the United States would be an importer of natural gas and the Russian Gazprom would already have started planning LNG terminals on the Pacific coast of the Russian Federation in preparation for lucrative contacts with the United States. Today, 10 years later, the reality is completely different. Yes, terminals are being planned, but on the west coast of the United States to supply the Pacific region, which has a gas deficit. What happened? Technological advances in drilling and in hydraulic fracturing have today enabled the United States to be a net exporter and, furthermore, CO2 emissions produced in the United States have decreased. In Europe we are responding to this success in two ways. The first is a moratorium, which is proposed by our great green inquisition. The second is an overly optimistic response, which expects some European countries to be self-sufficient in natural gas. Neither of these approaches is correct.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I have endeavoured to champion the approach that guarantees a high degree of environmental protection using the best technology and with the objective of obtaining basic data regarding the options for the use of shale gas. In my opinion, at the present stage all this may be ensured under current legislation whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, that is at Member State level. It will only be possible to initiate a serious debate in each country as to how best to exploit shale gas after geological and technological verification. In any event, it is good to leave this opportunity open and not block the possibility to exploit this potentially interesting energy source. I therefore ask for your support when voting.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, both of the European Commissioners have highlighted that today there is a lot of uncertainty about shale gas in Europe, a lot of unanswered questions. We do not know how many commercially exploitable reserves there are inside the European Union. We do not know about the environmental constraints and whether or not our current law covers shale gas. That is why if we look at the situation today only two countries in the EU are having exploratory drilling for shale for fracking – the UK and Poland – and in the UK there is a temporary moratorium because there was seismic activity in the first area where there was fracking.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have an opportunity as European legislators to make sure that if any country chooses to go ahead and exploit shale gas, we have in place proper environmental controls. When we had the hearing in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, one lesson we learnt from our American counterparts and legislators was not to have to play catch-up after shale gas extraction has started. A lot of the problems in the US were because at the beginning there were no environmental laws to protect the water table. Yes, there are problems with water contamination in the United States; they are getting them under control now, but there were problems. We have this opportunity, this space, and I hope we will take that space and support the report of the Environment Committee, which is a very balanced report on shale gas, and that is why it got a big majority in committee. It puts to one side the question of a moratorium and I know that an amendment has been tabled about this, because we all know that the decision on whether or not to frack is not a decision we will have to take: it is one that national parliamentarians will have to take.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that whatever happens on that amendment tomorrow, colleagues in this House will support the Environment Committee’s report. We see unity today from the European Commission on fracking and I hope that this Parliament can show similar unity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Tzavela for working very openly with the shadows on this controversial report. As Linda McAvan has just said, it falls to Member States to decide whether they wish to go forward with exploiting shale gas deposits on their territories, but that exploitation must be in full compliance with EU environmental legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission needs to be very vigilant and I welcome the Commissioner’s statement about Commission action in the forthcoming work programme. We need a tightening of legislation with regard to mandatory environmental impact assessments, for example, and the separation of the licensing and authorisation processes, as in offshore drilling.</p>
      <p sl="de">But shale gas poses a threat that goes much wider than the local environment. For a start, we do not know exactly what its footprint is in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, including the fugitive methane emissions which tend to occur during fracking. The studies so far about whether it is better than coal, worse than coal, better than gas, worse than other gases, are contradictory, so the research currently being undertaken by the Joint Research Centre is crucially important. I would urge the Commission to ask for it to be completed as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, and most importantly, burning gas unabated without capturing the CO2 is simply not compatible with tackling climate change and the path to decarbonisation. It does not matter how much shale gas lies beneath the soil of Europe. If we care about climate change, we need to leave it in the ground. It will not go off. It does not have a sell-by date. Its time may come in the future, thanks to CCS, but, for today, the only climate-friendly way of achieving energy security in Europe is to exploit renewable energy sources, not shale gas.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I would firstly like to remind people about Ms Harms’s request for the Conference of Presidents to quickly reach a decision on the exhibition outside. Our rules for lobbyists state that it must be clearly stated who the sender is. If a lobbyist claims to represent the citizen yet is in reality a company, then this is not in line with our guidelines. I hope you are able to reach a decision quickly.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Moving on to shale gas. I think that this is the ultimate illustration of the extreme greed of people who drill down thousands of metres beneath the surface in order to blow apart rock to extract the remnants of fossil energy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It provides a tragic illustration of where humanity is today.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We should not waste what little capital we have in investments to extract even more fossil fuel. The reserves of coal, gas and oil that have already been discovered are so vast that if we were to use them we would suffer a full-scale climatic disaster.</p>
      <p sl="sv">To waste money in finding even more fossil fuel constitutes the destruction of capital and the environment and goes against the future of humanity.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Moreover, there are certain specific problems associated with shale gas, namely the fracking referred to in the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We demand an update of Europe’s environmental laws. This concerns environmental impact assessments, the Waste Directive and how we address geological stability, water use, land use and the classification of toxic fracturing fluids as hazardous waste as well as the correct classification of such fluids in accordance with the REACH Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Additionally, the resolution contains a requirement for a ban in particularly sensitive areas. It is important that we maintain this, and I advocate a general moratorium until all this has been investigated. This gas has no future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, it is important that we measure base values so that we are not faced with the claims that have been made in the United States, where all environmental information has been concealed through the signing of contracts. Moreover, it is illegal in Europe to conceal environmental information concerning the leakage of gases and other problems in order to ensure that this information does not become public knowledge.</p>

      <p sl="pl">blue-card question. – Madam President, to start with, you spoke of a moratorium. I do not know whether the individuals who keep speaking here about a moratorium on shale gas are aware that it says in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that each country may choose its own energy basket. It is not possible to introduce bans and moratoriums. We are not asking for a moratorium on nuclear power stations, demanding that France shut them down, and it is equally not possible to demand any other ban on other energy sources. All we can do is think about how to regulate such matters to the benefit of all, bearing in mind the economic issues.</p>

      <p sl="sv">With regard to the moratorium, it is true that the countries are entitled to use their resources in accordance with EU legislation, and that is why I said ‘moratorium’ and not ‘ban’. A moratorium means that we will wait for the European legislation to cover all possible negative consequences of this before we start using the fluids, and therefore it is logical to demand a moratorium until this legislation is in place; thus this is entirely in line with the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, releasing the potential of unconventional gas in Europe means a more competitive energy market, lower prices for the ordinary citizen and for businesses, and thus greater competitiveness for our economy. Ultimately it means a capacity to reduce CO2 emissions more effectively and support for renewable energy sources, which sometimes need such support for the simple reason that the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. I do not understand why fans of renewable energy have such a problem with gas, even though it is their only way out, as American experience demonstrates. This potential is very well dealt with in the report by Ms Tzavela from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. May I thank her very much for it and congratulate her.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety looks by comparison as if it has been written on some quite different subject. It offers us a black, even catastrophic image of this industry. Of its 74 points, precisely 3 offer us a non-critical, non-admonitory and balanced way of talking about gas. The hard-line left only sees gas as a hazardous substance, as destruction of the landscape, pollution of water and air, toxic waste, leaking methane – in the end, and this is the real cherry on the cake, inflated land prices in Africa are linked to the use of unconventional gas in Europe. It is just as if we did not have the highest and best standards of environmental protection in Europe, which Member States are glad to introduce, along with industry. As a result of breaching the compromise provisions, the report is a total mess: in one place there is talk of a potential for reduction, and then in another place it says that CO2 emissions may actually be higher; in one place it says that the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive is applicable, and in literally three other places it says that this Directive should be applied. By accepting these documents, we are categorically turning our backs on a major and feasible change to power generation in Europe. We are coming out against security of supply, and ultimately against competitive prices. These are the reasons why conservatives and reformers are unable to support this report in this form.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, for many months now in the debate over shale gas we have seen a clash of opinions, interests and emotions, big emotions. As shadow rapporteur on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am once again seeing the danger of a partial non-objective view of the problem of shale gas extraction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Citizens of many countries – Poland, for example – see in the shale gas deposits that have been identified an enormous opportunity for a reduction in energy prices and a break away from external energy supplies, especially from the East. I very much regret that ecologists do not view shale gas as an opportunity to decarbonise our power generation, which today is based particularly on coal. Current conditions are making it increasingly difficult to put a climate package into effect, particularly further CO2 reductions, and these conditions are leading to huge economic and social problems in many countries. Shale gas is therefore an enormous opportunity, and not a threat.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Commission has now announced its intention to bring in new regulations in respect of environmentally safe hydrocarbon extraction, even though analyses, and also Ms Tzavela’s report, have accepted the fact that EU regulations adequately – and I stress, adequately – cover the unconventional gas sector. It looks as if only cooperation between the governments of the Member States may hold off a block on gas exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">To conclude, in this difficult context I wish once again to recognise the rapporteurs of both committees, who appreciate the strategic significance of shale gas for European power generation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, it is true, and has already been mentioned many times here, that there are many things we do not know about the extraction of shale gas. However, there are also many that we do know, and we should not forget them. We know, for example, that each operation to extract shale gas uses more than 19 million litres of drinking water, which would provide for the needs of 1 000 European citizens for a year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also know that each extraction of shale gas involves pumping 300 tonnes into the ground, that is up to 300 tonnes of chemicals, about 80 % of which remain in the soil and do not come out.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also know that each extraction of shale gas involves the release of radioactive elements and heavy metals into the subsoil which, together with the evaporation of toxic waste resulting from the process, is a real threat to public health. This presents a danger of contamination of drinking water resources and that is a real and imminent threat.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Knowing this, we also realise that shale gas extraction is an apparently easy answer, when only thinking short term about industry and profit, ignoring people, the future and the environment. However, represented in this House is also the Europe that knows that water is an essential, vital and important resource, that knows how to protect the health of its citizens and that it must protect this, and that seeks to reach agreements to avoid emissions and to propose energy efficiency, because we know that environmental standards are important – both environmental and health standards. So when you do not know everything, at the very least you have to be cautious. You may very well want to do this, but do not do it in our name or in the name of the citizens that we are here to represent.</p>

We are talking about water as an essential commodity, as an essential commodity for Humanity, and drinking water – that is what we are talking about. So it is impossible for me to compare the nuclear industry and shale gas extraction, because if you want my opinion on both, I think they are a total waste of water when it could be used for purposes that are much more useful for Humanity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the examples given by Mr Goebbels, it is not by chance that he mentions only two examples, one concerning the recycling of water and the other relating to the non-addition of chemicals, because in the overwhelming majority of explorations, in the overwhelming majority, what we are seeing is a total waste of drinking water and the addition of chemicals that stay in the ground. What I said and I repeat is: we do not know everything; there are some things we know.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the fracking debate is full of deceit by those who stand to profit from shale gas or who see it as a weapon in neocon hostility to Russia. We are told that most fracking in the USA is by small and medium-sized enterprises, yet few real SMEs have the capital or technology for fracking. What looked like SMEs are in fact limited liability fronts for giant corporations. They exist solely to spare the parent companies the huge cost of eventual clean-up operations, which will therefore fall on the taxpayers. The game is simple: loot, pollute and scoot.</p>
      <p sl="en">Claims of massive job creation are lies too. The Public Policy Institute of New York State claimed that 500 new wells per year would produce 62 000 jobs, yet a review by Food and Water Watch showed that the true figure is fewer than 7 000, scarcely one tenth of the promised boom. In every part of the USA where shale gas is exploited, house prices crash by 25%, with environmental devastation from hundreds of platforms and huge, poisoned slurry ponds. The longer-term threat to water supplies could be even more costly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Gas fracking is short-termist, boom-and-bust exploitation. Yes, it produces energy, but so would burning all our forests. It makes no sense except to lobbyists and politicians in the pay of the companies doing the looting. The answer to the energy crunch is not short-term fracking but long-term, safe, sustainable nuclear power and electricity- and hydrogen-fuelled transport systems. That is the energy economy of the future.</p>

The aim of these reports is, among other things, to convey to the Commission Parliament’s views on shale gas so that at a later date, as the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Potočnik, has said, the Commission can present a report on a series of measures relating to this energy source to enable harmonised action within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that both rapporteurs have put forward the points of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a very reasonable manner. Logically their perspectives are not exactly the same.

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, shale gas is undoubtedly an energy resource, and the big question here is whether this resource can be obtained and used in an acceptable way. What is happening at the moment, and the method of fracking used to yield shale gas, carries too many risks. This is reflected in studies commissioned by the European Commission. The risks are to groundwater and surface waters, the air, soil, and seismic effects. We must not close our eyes to all these risks. They are very high and with the technologies currently used, the extraction of shale gas is unacceptable. Yes, it is good to have a new energy source, but the question is: ‘At what price?’</p>
      <p sl="bg">There are several conditions which are not currently being met. Firstly, there is a need for new technologies to be developed. The hydraulic fracking technology used today obviously carries enormous risks and gives no guarantees. Secondly, we need full information. We all know very well that large companies conceal the methods, chemicals and processes used to extract shale gas, and this is no accident. Thirdly, there should be guarantees and economic commitment on the part of the extraction companies. This is not happening. We know of many places in the world where the environment has been destroyed following poor usage and improper compliance with the law. We need public agreement, including a cross-border agreement. We see how in many countries permission for fracking is given without proper public consultation. This is currently lacking. We must look at what is happening around the world. If new technologies are developed and they are proven to be completely safe, then we should not object to any energy resource. At the moment, however, such technologies do not exist. We need new legislation. We cannot impose a European moratorium, but we can say that shale gas carries a price that is paid by the local population. Companies benefit, while the local communities pay. The European Union must put in place barriers and limits that are sufficient to ensure that this method is used safely, if at all.</p>

      <p sl="de">blue-card question . – Mr President, Ms Lepage, are you therefore willing to accept that it is a question of physics rather than a lobbying question; that if you burn gas more efficiently than coal, there are fewer CO2 emissions than with coal-based power generation? This means, for example, that if we ultimately shut down our coal-fired power stations in Europe – a development that is already taking place in the United States – and bring gas-fired power stations on stream, CO2 emissions will fall. That is my question.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second question, which follows on from the first, is as follows: are you willing to accept that mining less coal possibly also has less of an impact on the environment than shale gas exploration may have, in other words that coal mining has a greater environmental impact than shale gas exploration?</p>

      <p sl="fr">blue-card answer . – Mr President, Let me answer both of your questions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There would need to be an extremely detailed analysis of the life cycle of both to be able to compare them as equivalents. As you know, because Germany was the pioneer, there are techniques for mining coal which are far cleaner now than they were in the past and which will lead to a considerable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, I do think it is useful to draw a comparison between them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding your second question, Mr Krahmer, we cannot have our cake and eat it, or in other words, coal and gas. However, the point is that today very often we do. Moreover, I was talking in general terms. As you are well aware, the oil production peak probably came in 2008 or 2009. If we exploit all the unconventional resources around the world on a massive scale, we will not be talking about the world being two or three degrees warmer; it will be five, six or seven degrees.</p>

I would like to ask whether you are familiar with the Commission report which clearly indicates that when shale gas is extracted there are fewer greenhouse gas emissions than when coal is extracted, and also that there are fewer emissions of this kind than when Russian gas is transported from Siberia to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, are you aware that there are very large communities that wish to extract shale gas because this will bring a radical change in their economic situation, and in jobs and investment in their region?

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioners, in my view there has been an extraordinary degree of misinformation during this debate. Why?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Because, in the first instance, we had an exhibition – I think Polish Members arranged it – that looks as if it is on the part of citizens but, when you look more closely, it turns out it is financed by a coalition of shale gas industry associations. I would say that is false advertising; it is masquerading as something it is not! That is the problem we have with this exhibition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, you may have forgotten, but the Commissioners mentioned it, there are reports which the Commission requested. I would ask you to read them carefully, because the report on the environment shows all too clearly that there is a risk of polluting surface water and groundwater and of depleting water resources. The impact on the soil can be devastating and can also lead to atmospheric pollution. Yet people say there are no such risks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not a question of being for or against shale gas, because decisions on energy mix are a question of national sovereignty. Our task, as elected officials, as MEPs, is to protect the European public. These reports show that there are clearly identified shortcomings in the legislation: poor adaptation of the Water Framework Directive, management of waste needs to be integrated into the Mining Waste Directive, and fracking needs to be integrated into the Environmental Impact Assessments Directive. If we do not overcome these failings, we will face serious difficulties, as seen in the United States and Canada.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, companies should be fully liable. They should have to prove that they have sufficient financial guarantees to honour the polluter pays principle in the event of environmental damage. It is not up to industry to decide what our energy future will be, but up to the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, with the support of around a hundred MEPs, we have tabled an amendment calling for a moratorium on fracking in the European Union. I hope as many MEPs as possible will remember their responsibilities when it comes to voting and will show that lobbyists do not hold all the power in Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="pl">blue-card question . – Mr President, Ms Rivasi is known for her highly critical attitude to this source of energy, and she not infrequently challenges even national-level decisions on this matter. However, Ms Rivasi, you did pay a visit to Poland with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and you saw what Polish environmental protection regulations are like. I recall that at that time you stated with some considerable recognition that we introduced this process very early on, back in the 1970s, in fact. Do you not think that American examples – even if certain mistakes were made there – ought not to be transposed onto European soil, that there are countries in the European Union which, although they may only recently have become Member States, nevertheless have environmental protection legislation and authority in this matter to an extent that permits them to exercise genuine environmental protection – protection of water resources, land, and many other resources that are tied in to the process of testing for and exploiting gas?</p>

      <p sl="fr">blue-card answer . – Mr President, Mr Grzyb, I would like to stress that Poland is in breach of the Water Framework Directive. You have already been asked to adhere to the standards laid down in that directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second problem with fracking is its social acceptability. The Commissioner mentioned this earlier. When people are made aware that exploitation comes with risks, it is still up to them to decide, as was the case in France and Bulgaria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, in relation to the risk presented by CO2 , which came up just now, shale gas cannot replace all sources of energy. You have to develop renewables. Europe is doing just that, Commissioner Oettinger spoke about it, and you also have the opportunity to do so in Poland.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, yes, it seems we now have a very heated debate; however, my country actually also has large quantities of underground shale gas in some areas. Ms McAvan said that test drilling has only been carried out in the UK and Poland. No! France is also currently carrying out test drilling in Denmark. However, the question is actually how we handle this new energy source. On the one hand, shale gas provides us with an opportunity to achieve energy independence, and this unconventional gas could replace conventional energy sources. On the other hand, we well know through bitter experience that drilling underground has in a number of places led to serious damage to the surrounding environment and groundwater in particular. Therefore, it is understandable, in my country at least, that the potential neighbours of the drilling sites do not feel particularly safe. However, when we now consider together the energy forms that will make up Europe’s future energy supply, it is important that we have a long-term perspective, because after all any damage will only become apparent after many years of drilling. There may be unstable subsoil, as we have seen in Germany and the United States, water pollution, environmental damage and costs for both humans and animals. We must therefore not allow ourselves to be blinded by short-term gains without taking the long-term costs into consideration. Nor must we believe that shale gas can suddenly solve all of our energy problems. We must focus on a broad mix of energy sources, ranging from gas from food waste to renewable energy and, in some countries, shale gas. We must adapt the legislation in this area as quickly as possible and accelerate research and development in order to improve safety in connection with drilling to ensure that a new energy adventure does not impact on either citizens or the environment. It is also important that we allow individual Member States to decide whether or not they wish to permit drilling for shale gas. We must not force countries to say what they must or must not use.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a general question to everybody who has spoken up to now. They referred to lobbyists. Please, since I am the rapporteur of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), I do not need any lobbyists to influence me. I am old enough to have my own opinion. So, with all due respect, please, criticise what I have written but do not refer to my text as being the outcome of lobbyists or influenced by lobbyists. This is my text. The shadow rapporteurs have worked on this and we have come to a consensus on many things. This is the product of collective work that has been done within the ITRE Committee. The criticism should be of us as writers with no reference to lobbying or that lobbyists have influenced us.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second question is the following. Since I am the rapporteur on this, do you not think that I have taken into account all the hazards and all the risks that shale gas may pose?

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on the face of it, and listening to this debate, I must say that shale gas is probably the most exciting development in the sphere of energy since the discovery of North Sea oil. It will benefit my own region in particular because we in the North West of England are sitting on 4.6 trillion cubic feet of shale, which means that we have the largest shale reserves in Europe. This could provide energy for the UK for up to 50 years and create tens of thousands of jobs in the North West of England.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also know from evidence in the United States that shale gas can reduce energy prices by up to 30%, which would be a welcome break for hard-working people in the UK in a time of recession.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, shale gas can also provide us with much-needed energy security, because we can become more self-sufficient and not so reliant on the Middle East and Russia for our energy supply. Shale gas would bring more jobs, cheaper energy prices and energy security. To me it seems obvious that shale must form a central part of any of our future energy policies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, perhaps shale gas is in fact the great future alternative when it comes to Europe’s energy independence. I really do hope so. On the other hand, amidst all the euphoria about the shale gas boom, we should not forget a number of facts in our current situation: Europe’s deposits cannot really be compared with those of the United States; they are deeper and would therefore cost more to extract. This was one of the reasons why, faced with costs of EUR 130 million, Österreichische Mineralölverwaltung (ÖMV) decided against test drilling in the wine-growing region of Lower Austria. Furthermore, the United States – unlike Europe – is able to extract the gas in sparsely populated regions. Luxembourg, for example, has shelved its shale gas plans for a densely populated area in Bettembourg. This is something else that we should not forget.</p>
      <p sl="de">Apart from this, water is, of course, a precious commodity for us Europeans, in view of the increasing shortage. It probably does not make sense to invest billions in water conservation and then expose our groundwater to a potential contamination risk. Not forgetting the earthquake risk, which has already led to test drilling being halted in Blackpool, England.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore believe, amidst all the euphoria and despite our hope that shale gas will turn out to be a major energy source and alternative for us Europeans, that we must come back down to earth and the facts. At the present time, shale gas extraction in Europe probably does not yet really make sense from economic and ecological perspectives and we must give careful consideration to how we conduct ourselves in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this debate now from this side of the House, which is getting worked up about the exhibition outside, is a bit hypocritical. Do you really think we are so stupid that an exhibition held outside will influence our voting behaviour? When exhibitions are held here, our Rules of Procedure apply, and anyone who wants to exhibit can apply to do so and must observe certain rules. What I find questionable is the dirty campaigning that is sometimes conducted by non-governmental organisations. This is questionable as it takes place on the quiet. People who cannot tolerate information events, however, should not be parliamentarians. This communication must be possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regarding the general debate, I would like to note the following: we here in Europe are not the ones who decide what happens in the Member States. I am not keen on fracking and shale gas, as I also recognise the major concerns relating to environmental protection. However, it simply does not reflect reality for us to be acting as if we were able to ban it, as this is not possible under Article 194 of the Treaty. Our task should be to point out that there are problems and risks, and in particular to urge the European Commission to ensure that the environmental protection standards for which we are responsible are also observed. Then we must precisely examine what is happening in the individual Member States. If the groundwater or other environmental commodities are being put at risk, we must prompt the Commission to take the relevant Member States in hand. However, acting as if we were the ones to decide whether or not Poland extracts shale gas does not entirely reflect reality.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, it is important to view the project from a long-term perspective. I also believe that the long-term costs far outweigh the short-term profits. For that reason I reject this technology, as various Member States do.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the truth is that the public is concerned about what we are debating here today, and they are also concerned about what has been said about the lobbyists, but I would like to focus specifically on their interest in what we are going to vote on tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is controversy in the international situation. The Commissioner for the Environment rightly talked about uncertainty regarding the extraction of shale gas. It has been used in the US and the abundance of this type of extraction has been mentioned. However, in some countries a moratorium has been put in place, such as in Germany and also in France.</p>
      <p sl="es">The questions in the scientific community and the contradictions within the European Union regarding the technical safety and the possible risks and dangers to the environment and human health mean that we should adopt a position on which there is as much consensus as possible, and with the participation of all the institutions, organisations and members of the public concerned.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, until there is a sufficient scientific and environmental guarantee and the application of precautionary principles and preventive action, we ask the Commission to establish a moratorium to begin with.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, you need to work together. You have expressed two completely different points of view. We need to know that we are not dealing with a threat, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy said. We need to know if we have a guarantee. We also ask for the standardisation of the EU’s legislative criteria regarding the Member States and the regions, which are responsible for issuing permits and can sometimes cause significant damage to the environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I cannot recall any presiding officer who has ever ignored the timetable quite so effectively, but maybe that is the reason why we are having such a lively debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">My country, Great Britain, was the world’s first industrial nation. To a significant extent, that was built on our exploitation of a natural resource – coal. We had coal mines everywhere in my part of the world. I look now to reducing our CO2 emissions and going for a non-carbon future, but throughout the 21st century we are going to be burning gas, to a greater or lesser extent. I would like at least to see that gas coming from within my own country, if that is possible, rather than bringing it in from the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="en">But of course there are risks and uncertainties associated with the development of shale gas. One that has been touched upon is the size of the potential seismic activity. In Lancashire, where there has been some exploratory drilling, Blackpool Tower has shaken. But I am also told when I look at the reports that actually the seismic activity is minimal compared to, say, coal mining.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are other issues: the environmental concerns above all about water, both the injection into and the discharge of water, and the whole question of course-of-lifecycle analysis and the CO2 effects. I hope that the Commission will address all of these things when it comes forward with this report and I welcome that.</p>
      <p sl="en">You can see this either as an opportunity or a threat. On the whole, I regard the development of shale gas as an opportunity, but please, environmentally at least, let us get it right.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think that this shale gas propaganda exhibition outside has already proved to be a wonderful own goal, by demonstrating how dishonestly these interest groups operate. I can only extend my congratulations.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as our debate is concerned, Mr Oettinger, you know, at least from Mr Potočnik, who is sitting next to you, how many questions remain unanswered and how many doubts cannot yet be dispelled. For this reason in particular we now need a precautionary regulatory framework to be put in place. I am criticising you because in the past, time and again, you have publicly allowed the impression to arise, and have actively encouraged the impression, that we can take our time over this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that what we urgently need is a moratorium, which we will use to create the regulatory framework within which the Member States, if they indeed wish to do so, must then make their decision. However, we should not waste this valuable time, and that is partly your responsibility Mr Oettinger!</p>
      <p sl="de">It is my opinion that the hopes being placed in shale gas are grossly exaggerated. With regard to energy independence, even if we stick to the fossil fuel path, according to the Commission’s figures we would still have to import 60 % of our gas from Russia, Norway or elsewhere in 30 years’ time. Independence? You must be joking! Partner in the energy transition? Not a chance! Take a look at the United States! Shale gas development is not a partner in the energy transition, but a rejection of the energy transition. The IEA, the International Energy Agency, has said that shale gas development is not compatible with a 2 °C target. Just a few days ago it said we must leave at least two thirds of the fossil fuels still in the ground where they are to ensure that we have any chance of keeping climate change within bounds. In this situation relying on the development of new fossil fuels is irresponsible, Mr Oettinger!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing that must be said: we are reading this report and listening to today’s debates with resentment. This is because it has turned out that something which has been welcomed as a great opportunity by many of Europe’s nations appears to you as nothing more than a threat. Do you know where the oldest oil well in Europe is located? In Siary, near Gorlice. It was dug by hand in 1852, when Poland was partitioned. Can you imagine what we will have to say in Poland, and what Members from the UK and from other countries will say, back in their home countries, when they return? That the free nations of the European Union, despite the provisions of the Treaty – since that Treaty guarantees us the right – wish to prohibit the extraction of shale gas? That they wish to take away a great opportunity from nations? What kind of sense is that supposed to make? When we talk about needing greater integration, when we say: let us be like the United States, when we see that in the United States shale gas is extracted without any overarching regulation, and each state does it, then we say: no, let us not be like the United States, let us be like Europe! But that Europe must be free, it must respect the right to take free economic decisions, especially when they are very restrictive on environmental matters. Those are the sort of regulations that apply in Poland and in many EU countries. I am disillusioned with this report and I draw the conclusion from it that it is not worth entering into such debates.</p>

You see, if you take oil or gas out from under the ground you create the same voids that are formed by extracting shale gas.</p>
      <p sl="it">So this is fine for other countries but it should not happen in Europe. We have to spend taxpayers’ money paying for stuff from third countries when we could – this is only a possibility – we could be self-sufficient with stuff we produce in Europe. At this point something does not make sense to me and I start to wonder whether the Greens have some other hidden agenda. I will close by saying that I really think caring for the environment is important, but I do not think we should miss this opportunity to extract something that could make Europe economically self-sufficient from the point of view of oil and gas extraction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I urge Member States not to authorise any new hydraulic fracturing operations in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear from past experience in countries such as America and from studies that fracturing does pose unacceptable risks to the environment, to public health and to local constituents. This comes at a time when really we should instead be investing in renewables such as wave and wind, of which we have a lot in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Research shows and governments have had to admit, like the government in Poland, that companies and governments almost always nearly overestimate shale gas deposits in order to support their actions. Notwithstanding the environmental impact caused by emissions created by fracturing, the considerable amount of constituency concern is entirely understandable given the very real risk posed by fracking to both agriculture and tourism in places of beauty like Fermanagh.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we are having a passionate debate today on a particularly sensitive issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to come back to the two reports we are discussing and to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Sonik and Ms Tzavela, for the very balanced and realistic approach they have taken on the subject of shale gas exploitation. I support them for that reason and others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first reason is the cost of energy and competitiveness. We are going through a serious economic crisis; many people are worried about the rise in energy prices and we know that energy bills are key to keeping our businesses competitive. On this issue, the United States is a telling example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second reason is energy independence and diversification. The focus should be on research into more environmentally friendly extraction technologies and strict adherence to safety conditions for the experimentation, exploration and exploitation of shale gas. I am concerned by the lack of faith in scientific and technological progress – which gives rise to innovation, entrepreneurship and a culture of taking risks – which has without doubt contributed to the loss of industry in Europe. We need to know more before we rule out shale gas definitively. In the long term we cannot and should not ignore the huge underground reserves in Europe and the opportunities that shale gas offers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a result, I am not convinced by the idea of a moratorium. I would like to see Member States being able to take advantage of this opportunity if they wish to, but only by respecting the principle of subsidiarity and within a strict regulatory framework that respects the environment, water resources and safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This means we need genuine regulation. If we use the results of the studies authorised by the Commission as a starting point for the debate I am convinced that we will be able to create a robust legal framework.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the timing of today’s session leaves something to be desired. I have never experienced us being over an hour late before. In this regard, blue cards should indeed be used freely, but should also not be misused.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to fracking, the debate reminds me a little of that relating to nuclear power – yes or no. I must say, however, that just because something is technically possible, that does not mean it has to be done. The protection of health and the environment must therefore take absolute priority over any immature technologies, and that is what I see when it comes to fracking. My greatest reservations concern the impact on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we are lacking is a sensible regulatory framework. We have various policy areas: Member States are responsible for the energy mix, but we are responsible for environmental policy. We have gaps in the water framework legislation. We have no mining law. I believe it is appropriate and timely for the Commission to think about how we can close these gaps, to create legal certainty and to ensure maximum protection for health and the environment. This – as I see it, anyway – is not the case with regard to fracking! A potential energy supply of the future cannot, however, be created at the cost of the environment or health. Furthermore, if you look at how many accidents and risks there are in the United States with the 50 000 existing well-bores, I must say that we should give careful consideration to how we get involved in this technology and what the protective framework for this future technology should be.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Groote, there is no technology without risks! The perfect energy generation technology does not exist. I believe the same applies to what we are discussing here today. I am very much in favour of a rational discussion. What we are currently experiencing is a new arrival on the energy markets in the form of unconventional resources, applying mainly to gas, but also to oil. It is neither appropriate to get carried away with euphoria about the great future of gas, nor, as some of my colleagues from the Greens and Left have done here, to paint a picture of terrifying scenarios which bear absolutely no resemblance to reality. I think we should bear in mind that these unconventional resources have the potential to change all the familiar energy supply relationships between suppliers and consumers, and that economic efficiency calculations for existing energy sources are also called into question. We should face up to this development. We should acknowledge that it could also be an opportunity for Europe and not only a risk, and we should prepare ourselves to take up and use new technologies in a positive way, to weigh up opportunities and risks fairly and not to fall into ideological debates.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, nobody has mentioned this yet, but something important happened on Sunday when the World Bank published its report and announced that the Earth will be more than four degrees warmer by 2060.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given that it is the World Bank saying this, I think it is safe to say that the situation is very serious. It means in practical terms that if we want to prevent this from occurring, we need to go from 35 billion cubic metres of CO2 in 2050 to 10 billion. This requires very strict measures, not simply just to lower our emissions but to actually reduce them by a third or a half. This means that when we are dealing with this European and global issue today, we cannot simply chase after easily available energy sources if we want to avoid the effects of global warming.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I say this because today everybody knows that methane has an effect on global warming 30 times greater than that of CO2 , and between 4 to 8 % of methane escapes between the wells and the pipes when extracting shale gas. This applies to all forms of methane, obviously. It is therefore a key issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, to give an example showing the need for European regulation, I went to visit a shale gas well near Wrocław in Poland operated by Halliburton. There was nothing to capture the water. Fracking had occurred and the water had just been released into the environment. That is why we need proper legislation and a moratorium while it goes through.</p>

      <p sl="en">Now we know in America from the full exploitation of shale gas that they have dramatically reduced their emissions.

      <p sl="en">Yet we in Europe have turned our back on fossil fuels and gone instead for renewables, which are hopelessly expensive and unreliable. We are undermining our industrial competitiveness. We are driving energy-intensive businesses out of Europe entirely, and they are taking their jobs and investment with them. We are driving our pensioners into fuel poverty. We are mortgaging our children and bankrupting our grandchildren. Our energy policy is sheer lunacy and must be abandoned.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I am not a member of the ‘green inquisition’, to which Mr Březina alluded earlier; far from it. However, I would still like to ask the Commissioners a few questions about hydraulic fracturing. First, whether the Commission is taking into account the fact that in Europe, particularly Central Europe, we have a different geological structure than in the United States. Here it is the exception to have a fixed plate with a homogeneous layer above it, in which extraction is possible. Secondly, I would like to ask whether the Commission is concerned with the impact on the groundwater and the stability of the water supply. This is the reason why in my country, the Czech Republic, the STOP HF initiative has emerged and, thanks to this sense of threat to the stability of water supply, there are currently almost half a million subscribers to this initiative. I would also like to ask how the United States is coping with the issue of the rapid depletion of deposits. It turned out that when President Obama promised stability of energy supply for 100 years, he was wrong. The last question concerns the negative impact on the landscape. The area of eastern and north-eastern Bohemia, where there are said to be mineable deposits, is only 777 km² in size and one thousand wells are due to be constructed there.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak in particular about the Sonik report. I would like to thank Mr Sonik for his work! His report was approved almost unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety by 63 votes to 1. The report contains two main messages: firstly, subsidiarity. Subsidiarity means that, as Europeans, we cannot ban Poland from using this new form of energy. It is very clear that Poland would like to make use of it and, under the Treaties, we do not have the responsibility to prohibit this. Conversely, the European Union should not put countries that do not wish to use this technology under even the slightest pressure to do so. The national and regional moratoriums are also mentioned explicitly in the report and are acknowledged. What this also means – and the Sonik report is clear on this point – is that we will not be using joint European funds for this technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my region I am experiencing considerable opposition, and not only from the Left and Greens. All local councils and the district assembly have said with a large majority, including the Christian Democratic Union, that they do not want this technology here. This is certainly linked to the fact that our region is very densely populated – Commissioner Oettinger made reference to this. In an area covering 1 960 m2 we have more than 200 water catchment areas. It is therefore certainly understandable that people are worried about their drinking water.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Sonik report also states that, where cross-border effects can be expected and are giving cause for concern, we need common European rules, and I ask the Commission also to tackle this as a matter of urgency. In particular, we should not make use of this technology in drinking water catchment areas. Otherwise, however, the principle of subsidiarity applies.</p>

As other fellow Members have done, I would like to roundly condemn the ‘trade in hope’ which has arisen over these possible reserves. We are talking specifically about reserves of natural gas.</p>
      <p sl="el">Similar discussions are taking place here, in the countries of my fellow Members and in my country, Greece, on the subject of oil. If we knew where these deposits are, and how many there are, we would not need to prospect for them.

I call for an end, here and now, to this demagogy and ‘selling of hope’. We must tell the truth to our fellow citizens. It is a myth, this talk of cheap natural gas for the public, and the same goes for the discussions on oil.</p>

Manna from Heaven, perhaps, but also controversial.

      <p sl="fr">The EU has to take a realistic approach that is both open-minded and cautious. We cannot write the petroleum industry a blank cheque, nor should we hamper future progress and innovation. If we are to learn from the United States then we must ensure we do not make the same mistakes, particularly the environmental cost of fracking, which is far too high, and the issue of water, which has already been raised. We also have to take into account the reality in Europe, which is that it has a high population density and a multitude of different laws governing the subsoil.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In other words – I am coming to the end, Mr President, we are already an hour behind, let me have 10 more seconds please – shale gas can only ever be, perhaps, something to add to the European energy mix, as Commissioner Oettinger has said.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the need for diversification of energy sources means that we cannot neglect such a significant raw material source as shale gas. When a number of Member States are heavily dependent on supplies, especially from Russia, documented native deposits of shales become real natural riches. Intensive studies and targeted exploitation of this fuel are in the interests of the whole of the Union. For Poland, which estimates its shale reserves on average at more than half a billion cubic metres, investment in this sector is a chance to gain independence in energy policy and measurable financial benefits. This is why the Polish Government is giving priority to shales when looking at power generation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The stance taken by some Members, who want to impose a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracking in Europe, is consequently all the more of a concern. Such actions are in breach of the Treaties, extremely unjustified, damaging, and, looking further ahead, detrimental to the citizens of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with Mr Sonik’s argument that we cannot afford not to make use of our own power generation sources. The example of the United States shows how rapidly and significantly shale exploitation has been translated into gas prices, which have seen a major reduction. This has an obvious impact on the competitiveness of US industry and must not be allowed to harm our own home-grown industry.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the United States in recent years, gas produced using unconventional technologies has radically transformed the energy market. That is a fact. Thanks to alternative sources of gas accounting for more than half of production, gas prices have slumped in the United States and they no longer have to rely on imports, as many have already pointed out in this debate. In the midst of the current protracted crisis, Europe can no longer allow itself the luxury of failing to deliberate thoroughly on such an opportunity, naturally adopting a responsible approach to evaluating the pros and cons. This is why I would like to emphasise a couple of aspects which can help us to form a balanced opinion on this topic.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What does shale gas mean in terms of security of supply, competitiveness and environmental protection? Let us look at security of supply first of all. By exploiting alternative sources of gas, the Union could reduce its gas supply vulnerability. Thanks to these new resources Europe would not only be able to counterbalance the dwindling traditional gas reserves in the North Sea, but also to reduce the unilateral energy dependence of certain Member States. Secondly, competitiveness. As the situation in the United States shows, the spread of alternative gas reserves can lead to lower prices since it increases competition on the gas market and improves the negotiating position of consumers against large-scale gas suppliers. In this way, the new reserves can improve Europe’s industrial competitiveness and reduce the burdens on populations. Finally, let us look at environmental protection. This is perhaps the most complex area. On the one hand, since gas is one of the cleanest fuels we have, exploiting alternative gas reserves could provide a suitable intermediary solution for switching to energy production with low carbon dioxide emissions. On the other hand, however, this must be properly regulated and efficiently monitored so that the companies involved in extraction adhere to the most stringent environmental regulations.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a long debate, but I fear that unfortunately that is not a guarantee of a good debate. The essential question before us is not who is influenced by which lobbyist but ‘what is the future of shale gas within the global context of the energy debate?’. For that reason there are two Commissioners before us who must guide us in this matter and also try to provide us with a solution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all: within the European Union we must determine very quickly what the long-term strategy is in the field of energy. Let us be clear about this – in any case with regard to the options as far as my group is concerned – and I believe as far as several groups in this Parliament are concerned. If we consider this matter in the long term, then around 2050 we shall have to ensure that we have a completely renewable energy system – and, yes, gas will form an important part of it. The question is: what sort of gas and under what conditions?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Then the other Commissioner, Mr Potočnik, comes into the picture because he must ensure – regardless of all the emotion within this Chamber – that if we ever switch over to the full development of shale gas – I do have questions about that and I am also sceptical about it – but if we do, then it will happen within a strict regulatory framework that takes into consideration the impact on our environment and the impact on our climate. Let us now wait a bit and let our emotions calm down a little and ensure that the European framework is tight and sound, as we have done in the past. As far as I am concerned, that is the future regarding energy and the environment if we are talking about this subject.</p>

The potential economic and industrial benefits from shale gas should be evaluated together with the estimated costs and risks to human health and the environment in both the short and longer term. If managed properly, these risks can be minimised, but we must ensure that we have a clear and stable programme for responsible industrial growth in Europe. Europe needs an objective scientific debate on the economic, environmental and social potential of shale gas development on the continent. I would therefore like to congratulate my fellow rapporteurs on their initiative in raising this discussion and I hope that together we can develop a winning common strategy for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, meeting the growing demand for energy is a major dilemma facing policymakers and governments around the world. Long-term strategic decisions may need to be taken to secure energy supply, ensure sustainability and keep costs to consumers at reasonable levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we have discussed biofuels and renewables at length, shale gas reserves are now on the agenda. The exploration of shale gas reserves may provide another possible solution to the energy challenges which we face. Onshore and offshore reserves of shale gas have been identified as being safe in the United Kingdom, including in my own region of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I am aware that this is a controversial issue, I believe we must strip away emotive arguments and look at the issue in an open and transparent way by concentrating on the facts. We must assess the impact of extraction and possible benefits for energy security, energy prices and employment alongside the possible environmental and safety concerns, human and animal health implications and the impact on tourism. We require a balanced approach.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, much has already been said today about the positive and negative aspects of shale gas extraction.</p>
      <p sl="sl">At a time when our economy is still quite weak, we must be all the more open to new ideas and be able to exploit them as opportunities. Shale gas is just one such new idea. Sensible exploitation of this unconventional source of gas can help us reduce our import dependency, as well as create new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Permit me to just shed some light on the aspect of reliable energy supply. In 2010 Europe imported 52.7 % of all its energy. According to Eurostat data, in the same year we imported 63.5 % of our gas, with our import dependency on Russia increasing by 5.6 %. In that year some Member States even became more than 90 % dependent on foreign gas imports. We are of course increasing our share of renewable sources, but we also know that the most appropriate back-up energy source is gas.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We have heard mention several times today of the United States and in fact the veritable energy revolution taking place there. Exploiting a relatively new source of energy can also be turned into a research and innovation opportunity. Why could we in Europe not become the leaders in developing techniques for shale gas extraction using less water, without chemicals, and with more efficient recycling and increased safety, or rather less risk of environmental pollution?</p>
      <p sl="sl">Concern for a reliable energy supply and high environmental standards would form the basis for new jobs for highly qualified young people, who in the current conditions are all too often finding opportunities beyond the borders of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Let us not say no, then; let us rather seize this opportunity for development and let us export high environmental standards.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the arguments against shale gas are very strong. Much has been said about the method of extraction, and I will not repeat this; however, it is quite alarming.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another important argument is that gas is a fossil fuel. Therefore, we would be making a fixed investment in another fossil energy source instead of developing renewable energy. We must also bear this in mind.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As Mr Arsenis pointed out just now, the utopia of endless cheap gas in a market that would consequently not function is nothing more than a dream.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What we as MEPs must do is respect each country’s right to determine its energy sources; however, we must also assert a precautionary principle. We must assert the ‘polluter pays’ principle; we must assert sustainability in the long term, and this must be decisive in how we vote tomorrow.</p>

I am in a position to appreciate that you do not understand this. I am saying this to the left side of the Chamber. After all, I could have spoken and made use of the method you have used against us: you pretend not to understand, you pretend that these arguments do not get through to you, that you are in the pocket of Gazprom, that you are at the beck and call of the French nuclear industry, that you are lackeys to those who make wind turbines in Germany. I could speak like that, but I am not going to. This is because I think that you have a right to your views. I think that you have a right to your views, even though they are wrong.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to repeat what has already been said by many Members. We have noted very many sensible things, proposals and comments here. For example, from Mr Seeber, who said that we must not continue to harbour the illusion that as the European Parliament we can prevent the development of shale gas. Some Members would gladly do that but we will not be able to do so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For that reason, ladies and gentlemen, we must of course make every effort to ensure the sound framework of this development. We know the great potential of shale gas, particularly in the United States. It is already very clearly proven what its effects can be. Let us, then, choose a framework for the smooth implementation of the EU legislation. Let us ensure that nowhere in Europe will chemicals be used for shale gas that do not come under the REACH legislation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, naturally shale gas is useful to reduce our dependence on foreign energy suppliers from outside the EU. Commissioner Oettinger has rightly stated that this is an important aspect. However, this will of course not relieve us of the obligation to continue to deploy renewable energy and especially, Commissioner, as you have said, to implement energy efficiency. Even the availability of shale gas in the future must therefore not lull us into a false sense of security and prevent us from taking further action to achieve energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To sum up, Mr President, we must go for a well-balanced, bold, but also careful approach with clear rules of the game that must be agreed at European level and all Member States must draw up an environmental impact assessment for any EU project.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this debate illustrates perfectly the intellectual blocks that dominate Europe. As soon as a new technology develops, be it biotechnology, nanotechnology or now non-conventional energy, Europeans tear each other apart on the possible risks posed by these technologies, while the rest of the world seizes the new opportunities they offer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are against shale gas. It is their right. Nevertheless, they do not have the right to prevent others from speaking in favour of this energy, whether this be through an exhibition such as the one that the green censors wish to ban. If you speak in favour of shale gas, you are accused of being an industrial lobbyist. Of course industrialists in the solar and wind energy sector who come to beg for more subsidies are not lobbyists.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Shale gas exploitation will progress not only in the United States and Canada, but also in Australia, China and various countries of the developing world. According to the international energy agency, shale gas will become an essential element of the world energy mix. Its exploitation will progress, with or without Europe. I hope that Europe will not cut itself off from this indisputable source of energy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the Sonik and Tzavela reports, but I have in my constituency an area of outstanding natural beauty, the Mendip Hills, where there are plans to exploit shale gas.

      <p sl="pl">blue-card question to Graham Watson . – Mr President, Mr Watson, I would like to ask you whether you know of any activity associated with the acquisition of energy that does not alter anything in the environment. I know many places where the siting of windmills as renewable energy sources is a cause of public protest. Do you think that the extraction of conventional gas does not affect the environment? Does the extraction of coal, for example, affect the environment? It does. Does the acquisition of energy from solar systems, for example, not have an impact on the environment, given that we have to make use of numerous rare earth elements in it?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Not long ago we had a debate – in which Mr Bütikofer took the floor – about how Europe is poor in many rare earth elements that are needed for modern technologies. These elements do not come from the Moon, though; they are simply dug up out of the ground. When we were looking at that report, we wondered whether we should change certain regulations in that case too, to enable benefit to be gained now from these elements at the locations where they are to be found, through an amendment to, for example, the scope of Natura 2000.</p>

I am very much aware of that. However, I am sure the honourable gentleman would also recognise that scientists are telling us that climate change is having greater effects than they were predicting even five years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">The more we use fossil fuels, the more we will be adding to man-made climate change, and the more we will see rising sea levels and other effects. What is essential is to cut down on the use of fossil fuels. While shale gas is cleaner in these terms than coal, it is far less clean than the kind of alternative technologies which already exist and which, with a little more investment, could be developed just as effectively to supply our energy needs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate on the potential use of shale gas is directed at the European citizen. Before the Commission’s proposal, the European Parliament is today presenting its own position. The worst thing, though, is that in this debate those in favour and those against are refusing to listen to one another. The initiatives raised in the European Parliament, such as the round table on shale gas, hearings and conferences, have helped to increase knowledge, but have not led to any convergence of positions. Meanwhile all shale gas is the same ordinary natural gas that we use on a daily basis in our homes and at our companies, while the prospecting technology hardly differs at all from prospecting for geothermal sources. It is my belief that the doubts relating to the potential for contamination of groundwater that accompanies the development of shale gas extraction, and to any leakage from wells, which are treated in the industry as disasters, may be resolved by adopting best practices where well drilling is concerned and further discussion of the merits. Care in the handling of raw materials is a duty that the state has to society. In Poland we have exorbitantly cranked-up environmental standards that are far higher than those in effect in the United States. There are clearly a number of planes on which things could be improved. One of these is dialogue with local communities, but this is a communications-related deficit, not a regulatory one.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The prospects for gas production in Europe are different from those in the United States. Therefore no one is promising today that shale gas will completely liberate Europe from imports. Suffice it to say, though, that it will stabilise those imports and enable the dwindling supply of gas from conventional deposits to be replaced. The mere possession of natural gas reserves does not guarantee an economic leap forward. That will be decided by, on the one hand, the amount of economically viable gas extracted and, on the other, the efficiency with which knowledge is taken on board and the development of European extraction technologies. Potential access to our own power-generating raw material is an unusual opportunity facing the European economy, and one which should be an element that brings European public opinion together. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, if you follow the discussion here, you could almost get the impression that we want one thing, but not the other. This shale gas extraction by no means excludes the development of other energy generation methods; we can still continue with these. We simply need to realise that our energy consumption will increase over the coming years and that we must exploit and examine all possibilities that are technologically available to enable us to meet our needs. This is an essential basis for our work.</p>
      <p sl="de">In view of these facts – that is, that we will be faced with a rise in energy consumption over the coming years – what I am seeing is that a technology which could have the potential to expand our energy mix – for that is the basis here – and increase our security of supply is being condemned with excessive haste from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that, besides reliable studies on the possibility and any risks of shale gas extraction, we need a more objective, less emotionally driven debate. It must also be stressed that as yet there are no studies that indicate that there has been any detrimental effect on the health of the population or that the groundwater has been contaminated. I therefore believe that a moratorium is the wrong course of action.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, here in Europe we have legislation that is the strictest in the world. We have a Water Framework Directive, we have a clear message on environmental pollution, and so on. These rules apply precisely to this technology and it is therefore taking things rather far to immediately condemn this technology and describe it as extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="de">Anyone who looks into the technology and really examines what goes on will be surprised at how cleanly this technology is actually run and what impacts there may be for the environment. Nevertheless, I would also say that we cannot compare our situation with that in the United States and Canada. We have a completely different land mass and the way our population is distributed is completely different. This means, firstly, that it is essential that the public is involved and, secondly, that we must of course pay particular attention to the impacts in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about an important issue of the future in the area of energy. We know that shale gas involves drilling and that drilling is of course also employed in connection with the use of geothermal energy. In this respect shale gas is also an enabling technology for future geothermal projects. I believe that in the future, while observing all environmental standards, we will be able to guarantee an additional, long-term strategic supply of geothermal energy, from precisely the depths at which work is currently taking place with shale gas. It will then be possible to use this energy source very sustainably for generations.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to the environment, attention must be given to ensuring that gas that comes to Europe via pipelines is also given a green certificate – that checks are also performed in relation to this gas to ascertain whether the same technological standards and environmental standards apply in countries outside of Europe. Only when this is guaranteed can this gas be placed on an equal footing with renewable energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should also investigate the life cycle costs of the various methods of energy generation, that is to say the costs for environmental and social aspects, and any associated costs. Employment is also important. We currently have very high employment rates in the countries which supply energy to Europe – something I consider to be very positive – and the value added in these countries is also high. We should not forget, however, that new jobs need to be created in Europe too and that the conditions for this could exist in the energy industry. Particularly with regard to the long-term contracts that we have in the area of gas, prices are not such that we would be able to make more affordable energy available to domestic consumers, which is also why the comparison of prices for the domestic market, with security of supply and affordability in mind, is an extremely important socio-political factor.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, a few years ago shale gas was seen as exotic in Europe. Today the whole world is talking about shale gas extraction as a technology that could change the global energy balance.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today in the European Parliament we are considering two aspects of shale gas extraction, namely the economic and environmental aspects. In my opinion, both of these sides need to be responsibly weighed up. I believe that the current situation is unacceptable because, first of all, some countries prohibit even shale gas exploration, citing an unjustified fear of ecological catastrophes. Secondly, these activities are almost completely unregulated. Environmental regulation is certainly inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The potential effects in Europe have not even been fully researched. For these reasons, I agree with the provisions of the European Parliament that it is essential to carry out more in-depth research into the effects on the environment and prepare the most effective response. Such research should be carried out continually before, during and after extraction procedures. Experience and practice should be constantly reviewed along with research data, and, in cases where it is believed that certain legal measures are needed, there should be an appropriate response.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We should also review the provisions regulating consultation with society. On the other hand, shale gas extraction should not become an industry that is subject to exclusive regulation. I am certain that it is not necessary to draw up new administrative rules that would place a burden on businesses in the form of disproportionate and unnecessary requirements and limitations.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In my country there are many people who claim that even renewable energy is not environmentally friendly and is a source of various problems, and I believe that there is no human activity that would not affect the environment in one way or another. However, in any case, I believe that shale gas is a path to energy independence and energy source diversification.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very important question that we must answer is: how can we generate environmentally friendly energy at affordable prices and become independent from energy supplies from third countries? If we want an honest answer to this, we cannot condemn any technology out of hand; instead we must investigate without prejudice whether this technology is feasible or not.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our energy potential in the European Union must be exploited optimally. This means having an energy mix and that is what our long-term energy policy must be. In some regions the wind offers us a source of energy, while in the south it is more the sun. In some regions we can cultivate biofuels, in others we can mine coal, and in some Member States, the extraction of shale gas is considered to have potential.</p>
      <p sl="de">Shale gas also has the potential to increase Europe’s energy security and reduce our dependence on imports. It goes without saying that we must not take any risks with the environment and health here. On the basis of the EU Treaties, the question of whether a Member State will exploit its shale gas deposits is a decision for the country in question.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe can, however, lay down environmental standards that must be observed if a country decides in favour of drilling. European environmental legislation sets clear framework conditions for this, which we emphasise and specify in more detail in our report. These include strict environmental impact assessments which must be carried out before each drilling operation. The extraction must have no negative effects on soil or water quality and consequently on the health of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unlike my colleague from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Ms Rivasi, I believe in the effectiveness of our European Regulations and Directives. Participation by the public and local residents and a high level of transparency must be guaranteed. The highest safety standards and the best technologies available must be employed to avoid a situation in which, with this technology, we once again create contamination problems for tomorrow today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it rarely happens that two committees draw up a report on the same subject, but it is good that this is the case, because we thus have and can take note of two different aspects of the same phenomenon – shale gas.

      <p sl="pl">I am very much counting on the study-based reports that the Commission is preparing, as the degree of ignorance of the consequences of shale gas that I am hearing today is simply staggering. If the main argument of Members of the European Parliament is that they have seen the film ‘Gasland’ and have drawn various inferences from that, this seems to me to be very dangerous for our debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One thing that has bothered me about today’s debate is that one side is emphasising that they are concerned about health and care about human health, and that those who talk of benefit to the economy, and of jobs, do not care about health and do not care about the environment. What are these accusations based on? We also care about health, and about the environment too.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, in the Lublin area, in one of the two regions of Poland where shale gas is extracted or is planned to be extracted, I am carrying out public opinion surveys. This is because I do not want to talk about the interests of citizens, I just want to listen to what citizens have to say on this subject. I want to tell you that in Poland, 73 % of those questioned are in favour of shale gas, while in the Lublin area, a traditional, rural, eastern part of Poland, 93 % of those who live in that area are in favour. When asked: how would you react if they were to carry out extraction in your location (because naturally one may draw people’s attention to this), 56 % of Poles say: yes, I consent to the extraction of shale gas in my location. In the Lublin area, 73 % say that. Mr Watson, I can assure you that the Lublin area is a very scenic one, and that the people who live there do not get worked up so much about views, but about their jobs, their income and the development of the region. They care very much about that.</p>

According to the International Energy Agency our energy imports are likely to rise by 40 % by 2030. The production of shale gas provides an opportunity to diversify our sources of gas supply even further and alleviate concerns regarding our dependence on imports. I think we have to make it possible to extract and utilise this energy source in a sustainable manner without jeopardising the quantity and quality of our potable water reserves. I believe that we need to provide more information and disseminate facts among the public so that everyone can understand, accept and trust this new technology. It is also important to mention that the production of unconventional fossil fuels represents a significant opportunity to stimulate the economy, boost employment and last but not least lend momentum to research activities, while in the medium to long term it will exert a positive influence in the fight against climate change.</p>

We need renewable energy resources, nuclear energy, conventional and unconventional fossil fuels such as shale gas, as well as new types of energy such as the methanol economy proposed by US scientist and Nobel Prize winner George Olah. Iceland is the only country in Europe to have one. China accounts for half of the global production of methanol energy. In my country, Hungary, there are four significant and promising gas fields. As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety I also believe it is very important to comply with environmental criteria. I think this is a crucial issue but we cannot take any step that potentially closes the path of development towards shale gas production, always bearing environmental considerations in mind, and therefore I ask for a wise decision to be reached in this matter.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the sustainability of shale gas is not yet proven and involves many risks. Therefore, Parliament should support the moratorium while we do not know its effects on the climate, the environment and health, because there are still not sufficient guarantees. We need preventive laws because otherwise this will simply result in ‘greenwashing’ the disastrous image and effects of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, public consultation and social acceptability should be ensured.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, thank you to the citizens who sent us mail to denounce the issue of hydraulic fracturing. Citizenship is not a lobby, it is the purpose of our policies, it is the right to communicate with your MEPs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, for the sake of the most elementary form of good sense and as a bare minimum, it is recommended that there be an immediate moratorium imposed on the exploitation of shale gas and oil deposits.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The environmental impacts associated with the exploitation of these deposits are significant and extremely negative. Associated techniques, hydraulic fracturing, the injection of possibly toxic chemical pollutants into rock formations necessarily leads to enormous instability in these formations and the degradation of the groundwater resources or watercourses draining from these formations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These examples of impact would be enough to ban the exploitation of these resources, but as a bare minimum a moratorium should be imposed. Moreover, there is no evidence that there would be a positive return on the amount of energy consumed from such an intensive extraction method.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It would be interesting to find out the results of and methodology used for this evaluation of the energy return on energy invested, if they do in fact exist, and if not, it would be interesting for such an assessment to be carried out. An energy return on energy invested evaluation covering the life cycle of each of these developments in order to assess the economic balance of this technique.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate is a manifestation of the unbelievable hypocrisy and inability to keep one’s word that prevails in Europe. When in 2007 my country, Poland, agreed to a dramatic fall in its international position by leaving the Nice system and going over to a double majority system, the compensation for this loss was supposed to be some wording introduced into the Lisbon Treaty concerning European energy solidarity. This wording, this principle, is being violated before our very eyes. Under Lisbon Treaty governments Nord Stream has been completed – a gas pipeline which could not fit in better with the principles of energy solidarity. Then along comes Russia and Europe’s largest country, Germany, and they opt to run a pipeline along the bed of the Baltic Sea for the sole reason – and they paid three times over the odds to do it – of bypassing such EU Member States as Poland. Today we are seeing another act in the same play, namely the senseless attacks directed against shale gas, which is an echo of the interests of Russia, which wants to maintain its monopoly, and France, which wants to maintain its dominance in nuclear reactor sales. Just one final remark, Mr President: if the principle of European energy solidarity is to have any meaning – and I am talking now to that side of the House – hands off shale gas! Let Europe enjoy its great wealth, which may serve as a flywheel for our economic development and economic and energy independence. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I will be brief and keep to the facts. Due to the compulsory cuts in emissions, it is expected that gas will play an important role until at least 2035. The decline in conventional gas extraction means that Europe will become increasingly dependent on imports. Looking back to 2006, when Russia literally turned off Europe’s gas, we are still getting cold feet. Viewed in this way, the extraction of shale gas would be another option, albeit a dangerous one when I think of the water and chemicals that are pumped into the earth.</p>
      <p sl="de">A positive point to note in this context is that an interesting pilot project is being carried out in this area by the University of Leoben together with Österreichische Mineralölverwaltung, concerning ‘clean fracking’, where, instead of chemicals, water, bauxite sand and starch are pumped into the earth. This means that if we give responsible research time to develop possibilities, we will be pioneers in Europe, enabling an affordable, but also environmentally friendly, technology to be developed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I wanted to make reference to what has been said by those who have spoken before me who have raised the problem of a possible seismic threat caused by fracking. I wanted to tell everyone that specialist studies of this kind were carried out in Poland, in Pomerania, which is my region, and it turned out that the seismic response to hydraulic fracking is less than the response from a lightning strike. I do not believe there has ever in the world been even so much as a local earthquake from a lightning strike.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioners, I believe that three hours of intensive discussion show that this issue continues to be highly controversial. I am very glad that the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety gives consideration to the fears, concerns and uncertainty that exist, including in large sections of the scientific community, relating to the impact that this extraction of shale gas will have on the environment and health.</p>
      <p sl="de">We certainly need alternatives to the fossil fuels currently being used. In my opinion, however, this cannot be a future fossil fuel with the knowledge we have today. That means that we must invest in research, we must allow the shale gas project time. We have the good fortune that shale gas is contained within the earth, which means that it will not escape and there is no time frame that we must adhere to.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must take people’s fears into account. This was touched on by the Commissioner at the start: in Europe our population is distributed in a completely different way and we have a completely different population density. We need legislation that is very strict and gives consideration to human concerns, in other words environmental impact assessments, as well as very clear sanctions in the event that this legislation is infringed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Quality of life is what we should be championing here in Europe, and that must not be sacrificed for short-term profits when we do not know today what effect these will have on us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I came to this debate as perhaps one of the ‘undecideds’, and I am afraid it has been so polarised that I remain to be convinced either way. But let us deal with some of the facts here and the reports we are dealing with. I urge people to read the reports, in particular the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is extremely balanced and takes into account many of the concerns. Let us also recognise that Article 194(2) states very clearly that Member States are sovereign when it comes to their energy mix and their energy choice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have received a great deal of lobbying only on one amendment, which concerns whether we should urge Member States to place a moratorium on fracking. I will only speak for my own Member State. We have not issued exploration licences. We have some licensing options to explore the potential, but the government and minister have said very clearly that they will do nothing until they see research, and that will not be available until 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to look at all of the risks and evidence that is there. Therefore, I am questioning whether we need to vote on this amendment for a moratorium, given that in many Member States there already is a de facto moratorium in place.</p>

    <intervention id="2-577-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, we would like to thank you for the many suggestions, criticisms and questions you have put forward and on this basis we will certainly continue to focus intensively over the coming weeks on the work being carried out between several Commissioners and our departments and services. Thoroughness will take precedence over speed here.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has been highlighted today how competences are divided up. What we do not have is a mandate in the area of energy policy or a general mandate to make yes or no decisions on shale gas. A ban or general permission without further obligations cannot fall within the competence of European policy. What we have, what my colleague Mr Potočnik has above all, are applicable rules, an applicable European regulatory framework for environmental protection, for soil and groundwater protection and for the protection of health. This must be observed. The Member States are under an obligation to observe it. If there are abuses, these are investigated. The question – which we are analysing – is whether we need to expand our legislation on conservation and on the protection of the environment, climate and health.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly: Europe’s energy mix is already being affected by the development of shale gas in the United States. Today we have large quantities of LNG in Europe from various production countries across the world, because this gas is no longer exported to the United States. This means the Americans are ensuring that they meet their own gas needs through shale gas, and we have access to LNG by means of existing and planned LNG terminals. The rush by Member States to build new LNG terminals and to obtain funding, whether via the European Investment Bank or via the budget, is just as great in the three Baltic states as it is in the Mediterranean region, on the Adriatic, in Croatia, Slovenia and Italy.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a second indirect advantage for us resulting from shale gas in the United States. Thanks to the shale gas revolution the Russians were prepared to enter into negotiations and also arbitration proceedings with us in relation to long-term agreements and maximum prices for gas. Some gas contracts with the Russians have already been amended and the gas price lowered a little, because shale gas has brought about a change on the global market, a reduction in the price of gas, and will continue to do so. The sequence is therefore clear: we will check the applicable rules and will be willing to update and expand these if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">There was one question that I found fascinating: do we need gas at all? I would like to say to you explicitly that the energy mix and technology is a matter for the Member States – and I do not believe that an amendment to Article 194 will be accepted by the Member States in our generation, as the circumstances in the Member States are so different that the decision for or against nuclear power, the decision on how long to use nuclear power for and how much of it to use, and the decision for or against coal, gas or renewable energies will not be handed over to European level by the 28 Member States. I do not expect this to happen in the foreseeable future. That being the case, it is clear that important decisions lie with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am in favour of the strong development of renewable energies. At present, however, 100 % renewable energies for transport, heating, electricity and industry is a long-term vision and one that, if you try to achieve it too quickly, becomes a sheer illusion. There was in fact a broad understanding here in Parliament that gas is the most flexible and environmentally friendly supplementary energy source to ensure security of supply alongside increasing renewable energies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Bütikofer, looking at the issue objectively – a short while ago you were still sporting your green battle dress from your party conference and were getting a little hot under the collar (I have to say I admired your passion) – the Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg, Winfried Kretschmann, someone we both admire, is asking for gas-fired power stations to be built via capacity mechanisms to ensure that renewable energies do not present an obstacle to security of supply. This means that you have to ask the question. I suggest that over the next 30 years we will have an urgent need for gas – regardless of whether this is conventional or unconventional – if the development of renewable energies such as solar and wind power, which cannot meet baseload energy needs and are not constantly available, is to remain compatible with security of supply and affordability in Europe. We will not be able to manage without gas over the coming decades and, therefore, ultimately without CCS either, if we want to take action in the area of CO2 .</p>
      <p sl="de">One last, general point that is on my mind: where do competences, both yours and ours, lie in the area of energy and climate protection at European level? In the three 20-20-20 criteria! These were broadly agreed upon and set in 2007 by means of the approval of all Member States in the European Council and, in parallel, by means of a large majority here in the European Parliament. I have now started the discussion on new targets for 2030, as 2020 is tomorrow – and for investors, it was yesterday.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I ask is this: amidst all the arguments, if we want to achieve agreement between all Member States, from Belgium and Germany to Poland and the UK, on matters concerning energy and climate protection policy and therefore want to retain competence and authority in relation to energy policy issues, also for the next European Parliament and the one after that, we need to be willing to compromise. If everyone tries to push through their own ideal or stubborn position, we will not get anywhere!</p>
      <p sl="de">We need a willingness to compromise between energy strategy and environmental protection. We need a willingness to compromise between countries that use 90 % coal – Poland today – and do not wish to import gas from Russia, because this is the lesson they have learned from their past. That is why Poland is looking towards nuclear energy and shale gas. We need a willingness to compromise from the British, so that they are willing, like Tony Blair back then, to Europeanise energy and climate protection policy further rather than renationalise it. After all, one thing is clear: when it comes to climate protection, each Member State alone has no global relevance!</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU 27 – we are still responsible for 11 % of global CO2 emissions. If we do not stick together, if we are not willing to compromise, if we accuse each other of lobbying and dependence on lobbyists, if we do not strive for new pragmatic targets for CO2 emission cuts, efficiency and renewable energies for 2030, this success story of European energy and climate protection policy will come to an end more quickly than many people think, and with it our significance in the eyes of Washington and Beijing and others, as well as our function as a role model.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, leaving aside the issue of shale gas, I am calling for a willingness to compromise from you all, if the success story of European energy and climate protection policy is to continue in the next decade with you or your successors. At this time, with an anti-European mood in a growing number of Member States, incredible diversity in the energy mix and growing mistrust, as it was possible to observe here in the Chamber today, I see difficulties ahead when the time comes to update, with our support, binding targets on CO2 emission cuts, renewable energies and efficiency – hopefully next year in this Parliament – if there is to be a certain chance of success.</p>

    <intervention id="2-578-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, it is good that we have this debate in the afternoon rather than in the evening.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will try to start with some facts. There is still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to shale gas. Reserves, best technology, influence on health, influence on the environment. I think the best proof for that fact is the differences in the positions in the Member States; obviously they are basing their positions on something which is a solid analysis and they are coming to quite different conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second important fact is that it is true that the US is ahead of us. It is also true that this has changed their energy market there, but maybe in this case their being ahead of us is not so bad and we should learn from their experiences. By the way, they are also learning from their own experiences. If there is one thing that really is clear today, it is that we need more knowledge, we need more understanding, we need better studies and we should continue doing that.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we already know is that there are considerable risks in a number of areas: surface and ground water, air quality, land use, biodiversity, seismic risks, local communities’ traffic and noise disturbances. These have been identified as areas to which attention needs to be paid.</p>
      <p sl="en">You probably know that in September we published three studies. One study, on the economic potential, was made by Günther Oettinger’s services. Another study, on climate impact, was carried out by Connie Hedegaard’s departments, and the third was on the environmental impact.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can be concluded – even if one conclusion is of course that we should continue with work of this kind in an analytical way – is that there are two conclusions we can draw from an environmental point of view and our analyses.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the risks related to unconventional gas exploration are higher than in conventional gas exploration. Second, existing environmental legislation on the EA, the CA, the Mining Directive, the Water Framework Directive, REACH and so on, is important and applicable and should be applied today. But it is not sufficient to address all the risks identified.</p>
      <p sl="en">So it is on that basis actually that we have proposed what we are here today together to explain. We have drawn up the proposal jointly. The form has not yet been decided because this is also connected, of course, with the impact assessment which we are starting, but I would just like to remind everybody that the International Energy Agency (IEA) position also is, and I quote, ‘there is a clear need for a strict regulatory framework’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to touch on the question many of you brought up, the question of competitiveness. I am not denying, rather I am acknowledging, that some industries, especially industries which have higher energy inputs and costs of course, are very affected by how energy prices are moving, as are households. Of course this is important. But to give you just one fact: last week I was at the VDI, at the German Innovation Engineering Federation, and they have actually said quite clearly that the average input costs for German manufacturing industry are 2% energy, 42% materials and 18% labour. I think that this is why I am also paying so much attention, if you remember, to resource efficiency because I firmly believe this is one of the ways of not only addressing environmental concerns, but also of addressing issues connected to the competitiveness of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we look at the trends in prices for resources, not just energy resources, but also energy resources, since the beginning of this century, we see that these prices have begun to go up fast and the expectation is that this will continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think we should really focus and prepare regarding the questions of how we can improve resource productivity, resource efficiency and how we can also improve energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third issue I would like to mention from the competitiveness angle is that we can, of course, also learn the lesson that not respecting safety, human health and environmental health considerations can also be very costly for companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We only need to recall the judgment last week imposing a USD 4.5 billion fine on British Petroleum. We should really do everything possible to ensure something like that does not happen, that we manage the risks in an appropriate way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the possibility of a ban: I think many of you mentioned that. It is more theoretical than actually practical because at the end of the day, you know the responsibilities of the Member States under the Treaty and we also know that if there were to be a proposal of this kind, we would need unanimity from the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of the moratorium which many of you mentioned, what I would like to say is that activities in Europe are currently at exploration stage. Intensified drilling and hydraulic fracturing are not expected for another two to three years from now, but full-scale hydraulic fracturing will also be deployed during the exploration stage for pilot product testing and this may give rise to certain risks and very likely also to public concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s timeline for conducting the impact assessment is deemed suitable for identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, both with regard to exploration and to extraction. But I would like to emphasise that Parliament should rest assured that the Commission will keep abreast of and react to any development which would change that timeline.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this exercise it will be also important of course for Member States to apply all the obligations pursuant to current Union legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">So where are we now? We have impact assessments in the making. The public consultation will be open until the end of the year and next year we plan to come with a risk management proposal which should efficiently and effectively address the existing risks. I think this is basically in everybody’s interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clear, predictable, safe conditions under which exploitation could be possible, proper management of risks connected with human health and protection of the environment. We know that we have to address all those questions now. That is why we are rushing with our preparations and we shall do our best to earn the public trust needed. Honestly, we have no guarantee, but we really need that trust. First and foremost, trust may be needed by the companies which could potentially invest huge amounts of money.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I think that shale gas has potential, especially as a substitute for coal. But we should not forget that shale gas is a fossil fuel and in that context we should not forget either that we are supporting the development of renewable energy with good reason, and we should continue doing that, as Günther Oettinger also mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">So finally I would like to thank you for the reports which were really timely and also for today’s quite lively discussion. Rest assured that we will take your messages into consideration and the risks which you raised will be dealt with in our 2013 proposal. We will also consider risk management and regulatory shortcomings in our impact assessment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I think that must have been one of the most lively and dynamic debates this term, which goes to show the passions that slumber in Members if we start talking about shale gas. It also illustrates the difficulty I had in ensuring that my report lived up to the hopes and anticipations of the entire House, as well as the majority of my colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the one hand, voices are raised because it does not contain a moratorium, and now an amendment concerning a moratorium is being introduced. On the other hand – on the right – Members from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group say that it fails properly to fulfil their aesthetic impressions, as the report features leftist miasmas. I was, or am, therefore in the situation of someone who is steering a ship in a storm – the most important thing is to make it into port. Along the way some deckhouses may be swept away, masts may break, and sometimes crew members may be swept overboard. I do think, though, that this report contains the voice of reason, because it talks about holding a review of current legislation at EU and national level, creating a catalogue of best available techniques and practices, ensuring the highest technical standards, providing ongoing monitoring, drafting the highest safety and risk management standards, and arriving at a clear definition of industry liability for any harm caused, on the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Full transparency of actions, a duty to declare concentrations and chemical composition of hydraulic fluids, minimising the use of toxic substances, minimising the use of water in the fracking process, and measuring water quality before and after drilling.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All the fears that arise today have therefore been taken into consideration – although these fears do not arise in all communities, as illustrated by the example of Poland, where the majority are positively inclined towards shale gas extraction – but we need to take the average and assure the citizens of Europe that in Brussels or Strasbourg the writ is clear – and we made every effort to guarantee the safety of both the environment and citizens in the exploitation of shale gas.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank everybody for the very lively debate. I can see Mr Bütikofer smiling: you were indeed full of passion today. I thank the shadow rapporteurs from every political group. We cooperated very well – including Mr Bütikofer – and I think we came up with a good compromise text, even if it does come from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The focus should be – and it is – on industry and energy. We did not ignore all the precautions that have to be taken by the industry when they are fracking.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I appeal to my colleagues for tomorrow’s vote. We have to recognise the potential in shale gas. It is not the solution for the future but it is a potential one for the transitional period. We have to compromise and see what the best alternative is that we have for meeting our targets for clean energy in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last and not least, from our side as politicians, we have to have a balance with the economic crisis that exists within the 27 Member States. We have to respect the natural resources that each Member State has and see that they are explored and exploited in the best way, using the best environmentally friendly methods and techniques.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Commissioners, it looks like we are at the beginning of a long journey concerning and referring to shale gas. We still have a long way to go and we still have to analyse all the impacts this will have, not only on the environment, but also on the competitiveness of the European economy. I think we have started well with this debate today and I wish good luck to this new, natural resource in Europe. Europe deserves it and we politicians have to make the best out of it in the best environmentally friendly way.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First and foremost I would like to congratulate Mr Sonik on his excellent work, which has succeeded in finding a compromise acceptable to everyone in this vital report on shale gas. As a Hungarian MEP I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is not moving for a European moratorium on unconventional gas production, thereby enabling every Member State in the future to make their own decision about use of energy resources. Just like every activity performed by humans, shale gas extraction can never be risk free, which is why it is important that the existing framework of environmental rules is complied with to the letter. However, we must not make the mistake of creating surplus rules on the basis of fears that have no scientific grounds, ones that will stand in the way of adapting this promising technology in Europe. Let us not forget that shale gas could increase security of supply in certain regions of Europe, as well as creating a new source of supply on the fossil fuels market and impacting favourably on energy prices. Last but not least, cheaper gas would increase the competitiveness of EU industry. It is also common knowledge that the ‘shale gas revolution’ unfolding in the United States will significantly reduce US demand for gas reserves in the Middle East, which means these reserves will become cheaper and more easily accessible for European consumers. In the light of all this I do not think it is a good idea for EU regulation to make it more difficult or even impossible to extract such an energy resource, one that under suitable circumstances could contribute to the energy supply of the EU and Hungary.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This Parliamentary report presents a balanced and calm approach to a highly controversial subject, and I am pleased about this. I am of the opinion that the choice of energy mix and shale gas extraction permits are of national competence. This conforms to the principle of technological neutrality I defend under the Energy Roadmap 2050. This is why I do not agree with the idea of a European moratorium on shale gas exploration and extraction. Nevertheless, the European Union should draw up, on a European scale, rules that guarantee protection of the environment and high safety levels. At present, hydraulic fracturing poses serious problems that cannot be ignored. Moreover, while there is talk of abundant shale hydrocarbon resources in Europe, no one can say with certainty that the potential is sufficiently promising to envisage industrial exploitation. Therefore, to make enlightened choices, let us continue evaluating the presumed reserves and researching exploration techniques. Let us not close the door on this energy source, in view of the developments on the world energy market and the stakes with regard to competitiveness for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In congratulating the rapporteurs, I feel it is worth noting that the revolution in detecting and extracting shale gas that is taking place before our eyes may turn out to be a real blessing for Europe. Extracting gas from shale on the one hand means diversification of sources of gaseous fuel, which is a condition for the provision of energy security, while on the other hand it ensures a restriction in emissions arising from combustion, a reduction in air pollution by the power generation sector and an increase in energy efficiency. The economy of the EU needs shale gas to get itself back into shape and to help create jobs, while at the same time breaking the link between economic growth and a rise in CO2 emissions. Shale gas means better implementation of the EU’s climate policy through a change in the energy balance resulting from a gradual withdrawal from an economy largely based on coal and replacing it with more environmentally friendly energy media. Is it possible to extract shale gas and lose nothing in the process? Clearly our fellow Members are talking about this in the reports we are discussing today. The recipe is simple: transparent legal regulations, an honest dialogue with society and environmental organisations, promotion of the safest acquisition technologies, and dedicated monitoring of areas where extraction is taking place. For its future development, Europe needs good and cheap energy – and the fates have handed it a gift in the form of shale gas. Rejecting it would be highly unwise, and would rule our continent out as a respected player in the global energy market.</p>

      <p sl="en">The TFEU Article 194(2) clearly states that energy policy is a matter for each individual Member State. It is important not to block the ability of Member States to make political choices on energy policy as this is a clear area of subsidiarity. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States should be free to decide on their own energy policy. Shale extraction is an issue which I have followed very closely and until we have the results of the environmental impact assessment studies, currently being carried out at national level, I intend to reserve my judgement on this matter. The Minister of State for Natural Resources re-affirmed to the Dáil that no decision will be made about commercial shale gas exploration or ‘fracking’ until 2014 at the earliest. Until there is time to consider the research the Minister confirmed that ‘the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised’ in Ireland. It is most unfortunate that we must vote on this report before we have the results of the environmental impact assessment studies. At present we simply do not have enough information to make an informed decision on shale extraction.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I admit that the draft report on the environmental impacts of shale gas and shale oil extraction activities makes me deeply uncomfortable. It is well known that the debate on this subject is to a certain extent shaped by the drilling industry, and I completely understand these entrepreneurs; it should be noted, however, that in densely populated areas similar extensive interference to the subsoil associated with chemical reactions and with the leaching of part of the compounds obtained from the depths of the earth carries certain risks. Geological maps show that over time there has been disturbance to the arrangement of the horizontal layers in the mantle. Therefore, even at great depths in the earth’s crust, we will inevitably encounter cracks, thrust faults and other geological phenomena that can cause catastrophic phenomena during the extraction of gas and oil, and also when carrying out certain other activities. It surprises me that shale gas is considered an environmentally clean fuel, even though it is mainly composed of methane. When burned it produces the same amount of CO2 as conventional types of natural gas or carbonaceous fuels. The potential risks to the plains of the United States or Canada or Australia cannot be compared with any problems in a densely populated area. It is therefore appropriate to proceed with caution. In my opinion, in a large part of the EU the risks significantly outweigh the benefits. I therefore agree with the need to carefully review and modify the regulations governing the extraction of such mineral raw materials.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union’s dependence on energy imports, in particular oil and, more recently, natural gas, is a central concern with regard to energy policy for reasons of security of energy supply. The fall in primary production of natural gas has increased the EU’s dependence on primary energy imports, with more than 60 % of gas consumed by the Union being imported. A geological resources study published in May 2012 indicated that natural gas could make up 25 % of global energy resources. Shale gas is a resource which no EU Member State can afford to neglect. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, Europe has 18 000 billion cubic metres of shale gas reserves, a far from negligible figure for the European continent. Of course, the impact that the exploitation of this gas can have on the environment must be borne in mind, but the technologies used around the world today can facilitate efficient exploitation, including with regard to environmental protection. Rational exploitation would have a dual purpose: reducing the EU’s dependence on gas imports, and creating new jobs and horizontal industrial development.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I ask all supporters of shale gas to remove their rose-tinted spectacles, given to them by the mining lobby, just for a moment. The environmental risks of shale gas are unresolved. In the EU we do not want to keep such risks under wraps using contracts as they do in the United States; we have the Aarhus Convention. The extraction of shale gas is not sufficiently controlled by current legislation. Many rules have not been implemented to the required extent in the Member States. Extraction has both ecological and safety-related cross-border impacts, such as threats to aquifers or induced seismic activity. Shale gas does not solve either Europe’s energy security or the EU’s independence from energy imports. Reserves of shale gas can only compensate for the decline in production of conventional gas, at the cost of environmental risks and higher greenhouse gas emissions. The extraction of shale gas will not bring down gas prices in the EU to the same extent as in the United States because its supplies in Europe are smaller and extraction will be more expensive. However, even if there were a reduction in gas prices, this would only cause an increase in its consumption, as has happened in the United States. In many countries the public have rejected the extraction of shale gas. We represent the public, we have the necessary information and we have the appropriate responsibility. I call upon the proponents of shale gas extraction to realise that the European Parliament should represent European citizens, not the oil companies and their profits.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Shale gas extraction raises many questions. Although the conditions in my country, Slovakia, are not right for this type of extraction, it is necessary to speak very openly about the arguments for and against the extraction of shale gas. I appreciate the Commission’s report, which earnestly summarises the threat posed by shale gas extraction to the environment. I would also like to support the report by Mr Sonik. On the other hand, I believe that the report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is too optimistic. Economic data on employment reported by firms, as well as estimates on the extraction of reserves, are so far only estimates. Legislative conditions are against extraction – offices and institutions are not prepared for this technology, and it is not clear how the discharge of fractured fluids will be monitored or by whom, or how companies will be liable for any damages. To date there has been no commercial extraction in the EU and reserves are as yet unproven. Therefore the environment and public health must take precedence over economic considerations.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Our gas market has changed dramatically in recent years, mainly because of the lower price of LPG supplies redirected from the United States to the European market. The main reason for this is the shale gas revolution in the United States, thanks to which it is not only close to fully meeting its gas needs, but in the near future may even become an exporter of natural gas. Shale gas is a reality, which will continue to change not only the energy, but also the economic future of the world, firstly because the price of shale gas is three to five times lower than the current price of gas in Europe. The low cost of energy is a powerful factor in improving the competitiveness of any economy, and in the global competition for markets, this possibility should not be underestimated by any country. Instead of thinking about a European ban on the development of shale gas extraction, then, let us take a constructive view and take advantage of the opportunities offered by European shale gas, in the best and safest way possible. Let us review our legislation and take all necessary steps to protect the soil, drinking water, the environment and our health. Let us support the search for new and safer technological solutions for shale gas, instead of hampering progress.</p>

      <p sl="en">In my constituency of London gas prices are at an all-time high. Fuel poverty affects almost a fifth of London households. It also contributed to 2 500 excess winter deaths in 2010/11. A British Geological Survey study in 2010 estimated that if UK shales were similar to those in the USA they could yield some 150 billion cubic metres of gas. Shale gas could be an abundant and cheap source of energy that could help re-ignite the economy. Also with carbon capture and storage technology, shale gas can be used as a low-carbon source of energy. I believe that we urgently need to begin drilling and testing to make an assessment of how much shale gas is recoverable. We are facing an energy crisis and ordinary citizens are suffering from a high cost of living. At a time of economic turmoil, we must do everything we can to reduce the burden on our constituents. I supported shale gas extraction as I believe it can be used as a tool to tackle climate change. I also hope that shale gas will ensure that Londoners can stay warm in winters to come.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In a situation of economic collapse, we need to take every step to buttress European productivity and the economy of individual states within the Union, and to lower citizens’ costs of living. There has to be a consensus on these objectives in the forum of Parliament. This makes it all the harder to understand the behaviour of representatives of the European left. This behaviour runs counter not only to the spirit of integration, but also to common sense. The attack on shale gas – the remedy for Europe’s energy problems – is remarkable for its one-sided and narrow point of view, a point of view that has so far been most associated with lobbyists for Russia’s Gazprom – a monopolist which will be the biggest loser from shale gas. I would just remind you that the recent CERA report assesses shale gas deposits in Europe at 173 billion/m3 . The potential to extract and make use of even 10 % of these geological reserves means a massive change to European security in the gas supply sphere and a significant strengthening of the European economy. This is especially true since CERA estimates suggest that by 2025 the level of gas production in Europe should lie in the 60-200 billion m3 range. Moreover, in contrast to Russian gas, this gas is to be found within the European sales market. As a consequence, if Europe can just manage to develop unconventional gas extraction and suitably control its costs, it will provide strong competition both for Russian gas transported from distant Siberia and for LNG produced from shale gas and brought to Europe from the United States.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement on cases of restructuring in the European car industry (2012/2880(RSP)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-591-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the last few months a number of restructuring processes have been announced in many industrial sectors in various Member States. 274 cases of restructuring were registered in the third quarter of 2012, according to the latest data from the European Restructuring Monitor. These cases amount to a net job loss of more than 74 000, thus showing a reversed situation compared to the pre-crisis one, which saw the net creation of 6 600 jobs in the third quarter of 2007 for the same number of restructuring cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">These figures reflect the current difficult macro-economic situation linked to the sovereign debt crisis but probably also a structural change in the European economy and labour market. This requires clear policy action. More than ever, good anticipation of change and responsible management of restructuring is crucial. If not managed properly, restructuring operations can have negative consequences for the economy of the surrounding area, incur high social costs across regions and negatively affect workers and their families.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation is particularly worrying in the automotive sector, where major restructuring operations have been announced in recent months. There is a significant risk that more such announcements will be made in the coming months. The latest announcements concern PSA and Ford. PSA has announced its intention to close its plant in Aulnay-sous-Bois and to restructure the plant in Rennes. Ford has announced its intention to close its plant in Genk in Belgium as well as the plants in Southampton and Dagenham in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="en">The total amount, including indirect job losses in the supply chain, could be as much as 22 000 job losses. Moreover, announcements were also made by General Motors, Volvo and, in the supply chain, by Faurecia. While the difficulties of the automotive industry are linked to the situation on European markets, it has to be noted that the industry also suffers from long-standing structural overcapacities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is ready to help Member States and all stakeholders to mobilise instruments and policies that can help the sector to restructure and build a sustainable future. Most urgently, the Commission wants to explore all possibilities to support workers affected by restructuring or likely to be affected in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has already spelled out in detail its strategy for the automotive sector in the CARS 2020 Action Plan, adopted on 8 November 2012. In this strategic document, the Commission announces how it intends to conduct its policies supporting the sector in many different policy fields: research, development and innovation, trade policy, a better functioning internal market, investment in human capital and the anticipation of change and restructuring.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective is to boost the competitiveness of the industry. Some actions will thus produce effects in the longer term; others, however, can be implemented already. The Competitiveness Council of 10 December 2012 will focus discussions on these, with a view also to minimising the social and economic consequences of announced restructuring.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the field of anticipation of change, the Commission will support the creation of a European Automotive Skills Council, which will bring together existing national organisations conducting research on skills and employment in the automotive sector. The Commission will also support the creation of a social dialogue committee that should bring together manufacturers and suppliers representing workers and employers at the joint request of all interested parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to overcapacity and restructuring, it has to be stressed that this is mainly the responsibility of the industry, but the Commission also has a role to play. First of all, the Commission will monitor restructuring activities to ensure their strict compliance with EU legislation, in particular concerning state aid and internal market rules. The Commission also expects each individual company to comply with the rules established in the directives on information and consultation and on collective redundancies, as well as with any existing company agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the Commission will make all possible efforts to minimise the negative social effect of restructuring, which is the core of the Commission’s message today. For that purpose, the Commission will encourage the use of the European Social Fund for retraining and re-skilling of workers in the new financial perspective of the Structural Funds. The Commission will also encourage the Member States to use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the EGF. It is important to note that the automotive sector is already the sector with the highest number of EGF cases – namely 16 – and that almost 21 000 automotive workers have been allocated EGF assistance worth a total of EUR 113 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, it would be more important then ever to keep a reinforced EGF in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) after 2014. This is far from being guaranteed and I count on your support in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to ensure policy consistency, the Commission will consider re-launching the inter-service restructuring Task Force, which will bring together the Member States, regional authorities, industry and the social partners to study and follow up the main cases of automotive plant closures or significant downsizing. The Task Force would streamline the use of the relevant EU Funds by providing technical assistance, reducing waiting time, advising on the most effective use of resources, monitoring and reporting.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, for each region affected by a plant closure or a significant downsizing, the Commission will advise, facilitate and liaise with a partnership of regional stakeholders, led by local authorities who would pool the resources available and prepare a complete package of measures such as measures for workers made redundant, support for reconversion of suppliers, community support, measures to develop technology, and so on and so forth.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to benefit from existing experiences, the Commission also wants to identify good practices and promote an anticipative approach in restructuring, in consultation with representatives of the automotive-intensive regions, employment authorities and the sector’s stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">More generally, the Commission will encourage Member States to make use of labour flexibility schemes and ESF cofinancing to support suppliers who may need additional time to find new clients following the closure or downsizing of an automotive plant.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, you have spoken about overcapacity and restructuring. We are of course aware of these aspects but today we are assuming rather too easily that we at European level or you as the European Commission can do absolutely nothing about it. You speak about monitoring the implementation of European legislation but today the situation is such that multinationals like Opel, General Motors or Ford just play off the different national subsidy systems against each other or look to see where they can produce the cheapest for the lowest social costs and then simply move their production to that place.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is actually the ultimate misunderstanding of the defective functioning of the European internal market when companies delocalise on the basis of the scope of the national market and that can of course not be the intention. It also illustrates in a particularly painful way, Commissioner, the appalling lack of minimum social agreements within Europe. May I refer to Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It provides specifically for the possibility of the European Commission making proposals in order to ensure the balanced progress of the internal market and we should be able to avail ourselves of that article perfectly to support such restructuring.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to make two more points, Commissioner; first of all the new CARS 2020 Action Plan, which you mentioned, refers specifically to measures provided to support suppliers who are affected by the closure of a car factory. It is very important that suppliers can call upon bridging measures in order to be able to look for new customers. Are you ready to do something about it in the short term?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, Commissioner, a quick word about the European Investment Bank: it must stop granting advantageous loans to large companies, large car manufacturers that then use these subsidies to produce elsewhere outside the European Union and to delocalise. That can obviously not be the intention. It is naive, it is unacceptable and it must stop. Can we also expect action from you in that regard?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Europe is being asked to perform a new task of industrial policy coordination, and even the most ardent supporters of the freedom of private initiative are calling for this role to be carried out. Without more Europeanisation of national strategies, particularly in terms of job protection, the current crisis will not be resolved and there will be no economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="it">The automotive crisis is not just about overcapacity: it is about widespread job losses. The crisis now seems to be structural and concerns the very future of the automotive sector as we know it today. We want to have an automotive industry in Europe and do not want to squander the skills, know-how and professional expertise that exist. We are therefore calling for a major restructuring and regeneration project to be launched swiftly so that the costs do not escalate disproportionately.</p>
      <p sl="it">Restructuring cannot only derive from fragmented decisions by national governments and individual companies. We at least need to try to join forces and guide this painful process at EU level, making the interested parties sit down at the table for a dialogue between the social partners, manufacturers, trade unions and governments in each country, offering support for research, innovation, training, upskilling and the necessary funding. I know that this will be an arduous task, because the national interests of individual companies are not the same. However, since competition within the European Union is highly ambiguous and at times risks being unfair, I believe that ultimately it is in the interests of all countries to have effective EU guidance and stimulus, so that together we can face the increasingly aggressive global market.</p>

    <intervention id="2-594-000" speaker_id="28116" name="Marian Harkin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am delighted to be able to make a few comments on cases of restructuring in the car industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all, we have to consider the impact on the industry itself and on the economies in the various Member States, but equally we need to look at the social impact of all of this – the impact on workers, the impact on their families and on their communities. There is no doubt that this situation has been looming for a long time, with declining domestic demand and of course overcapacity in the industry, and it certainly is questionable whether adequate measures have been taken by Member States to anticipate the structural change that is now taking place in Europe. I certainly look forward to the Commission’s proposals in this area. I would welcome the setting up of an Automotive Skills Council and the social dialogue as outlined by Commissioner Andor.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I am particularly concerned with the social impact. The current recession in the EU, coupled with the austerity measures and indeed slow growth globally, paints a pretty dismal picture for many of the workers who will be made redundant. I believe that, in this context, we need to ensure a European response to the issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do have a number of suitable instruments at our disposal, including one mentioned by the Commissioner himself – the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). That Fund was put in place to deal with large-scale redundancies due to globalisation and, in my view, it could provide a significant European response to the situation. The EGF can support Member States in retraining and upskilling workers, and indeed it can assist workers in setting up their own businesses or in accessing opportunities to change their career path. The EGF is important for all Member States – indeed 21 Member States have already accessed it – but it is particularly important for those Member States which are cutting back on expenditure and investment at this point in time, because it can give real assistance and help in funding the retraining and the upskilling of redundant workers.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the moment we have a blocking minority in Council on the EGF, yet I believe that as an instrument it would be of real assistance in this situation. I am once again calling on Member States to review their opposition to this Fund and look at it as another policy tool available to their redundant workers. It will not solve all their problems, but it can be an important part of the policy mix.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I agree with Mr Belet that we need a coherent industrial policy in regard to the location of industry and the harmonisation of social standards.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, you mentioned CARS 2020. That can of course at the very most be just the beginning of an answer to the problems in the motor industry. Yes, we must invest in advanced technologies and in clean vehicles. Yes, improved market conditions and financial stimuli are necessary for the environment. Yes, better market access is necessary. Yes, training of older and younger workers is necessary and the European Social Fund must be used, but all of that is naturally not a response to the specific social disasters that the employees of Ford Genk, the staff in Southampton and the workers in Rennes are now facing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The reality is that the car giants set Member States against each other on the principle that ‘one man’s meat is another man’s poison’. The reality is that ordinary employees are laid off or are forced to sacrifice pay while CEOs are richly rewarded with salaries and bonuses in the millions. The reality is that when a company closure is announced, share prices rise. The reality is that the car giants invest far too little in innovation, people and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, you have mentioned a whole toolbox of possible measures, but you have actually been really vague. Can you say specifically here that in all the regions affected you will support very specific initiatives that will lead to a change? Can you promise that you and your departments will do everything possible to assure the tens of thousands of employees at Ford, PSA and Volvo, who will probably soon be unemployed, that they will once again have some sort of job prospects thanks to political action being taken? That is my very specific question.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think this is about the fourth debate I have been involved in since I joined this House 13 years ago in which we have discussed problems of over-capacity in the automotive industry. From my perspective, having been in that industry for 30 years, I feel the situation we are facing is amongst the worst, because sales demand has dropped off so much and shows no sign of immediate recovery. The Commission has made a very realistic assessment and has talked about the key tools that need to be put in place to help in the restructuring which many Members are calling for.</p>
      <p sl="en">The key to the future for the automotive industry in Europe – and we want a really strong and globally competitive automotive industry – is going to be investment in new technologies and new products. That is a core part of the 2020 proposal, but in the meantime we have to help those employees who are affected by plant closures. I have been through that where I live. We have had two major plant closures in the last ten years. We have done the things that the Commissioner talked about: we have pulled local authorities together, we have used European funds and we have looked for ways to retrain and reassign people into manufacturing or service businesses in order to redevelop jobs in those economies. We have the knowledge, ladies and gentlemen; it is there for you to use. Please come and talk about it. This is not a new situation, and it is essential that we deal with it in the way we are talking about if we are to have a really strong, long-term future for a crucial industry.</p>

There is an issue that I have been confronted with all these years – and I would like to ask my colleague the following question: how can it be that such companies received EU, local or national funding seven or eight years ago, only to close their doors six years later?</p>
      <p sl="de">Now funding must be issued once again, to help ensure, quite rightly, that people do not lose their jobs.

      <p sl="en">blue-card answer . – I am not sure that you were disagreeing with me. The point I was making, and I think Mr Andor was very realistic, is that the funding we need to put in is to help those employees affected by what are inevitable plant closures. The Ford Company according to their own figures – and you can check them – is going to lose EUR 1.6 billion this year in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now Mr Staes was talking about the fact the he felt that the management of Ford could make sacrifices and stop closing plants. I am afraid if you are losing EUR 1.6 billion, colleagues, you have to do something about it. I think Ford are right in restructuring production because they want to invest in new models. That is the reality of where we are. We are supporting research and development and we also need to deploy the instruments which Mr Andor was talking about to help people back into new jobs.

Because of the way they have restructured their operation in the United States they are doing relatively well there. We need Ford. We need strong partners in Europe. We need investors in Europe. That is why I made the point I did. We are not here to question their wisdom in how much they pay their chief executive globally, because Ford is a global business with plants all over the world. We have to decide what should happen and what is realistic in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">My point is that the priority is to help the people affected, and not to make criticisms about salaries which are not actually going to help solve the problem.

In Italy, for example, Fiat’s chief executive is misleading the public, and more importantly Fiat’s employees, by saying, ‘Don’t worry, our new products will be sold on the US market’, when everyone knows very well that the US market has no need for more imports; it is quite capable of meeting its future production requirements, even though it seems to have its own problems which are very different from Europe’s.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Europe there is no industrial policy for the automotive sector: we have a European Union which is dilly-dallying and has failed to come up with a sound plan, in view of social and other developments. The market has completely changed, and Europe needs to wake up. It needs to do something, because we need to maintain and conserve the level of quality and the technological and development capacity of manufacturing, especially in a key sector such as the European automotive industry.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, if European institutions actually want to promote solidarity and jobs for everyone, they should invent a real industrial and social shield to protect the car industry, jobs, research and worker training.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a lot of noise is being made about a so-called growth pact, why do we not mobilise the Structural Funds and the European Investment Bank to protect each site, each job at PSA in Aulnay and Rennes, and Ford and General Motors too, for that matter? The automotive sector needs new impetus for the vehicles of tomorrow, which should be clean, safer and more energy efficient, and new research and new factories are needed for this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe’s trade policy should be completely revised, especially its agreements signed with Korea and those being negotiated with Japan, which bleed the European motor industry dry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I propose that, in coordination with the Member States, moratoria should be decided on all redundancy and company closure plans, and that any company that has benefited from European or national public funds and makes redundancies or relocates, should return this money. A new public credit system backed by European funds and the Central European Bank could promote innovative, environmentally friendly projects that create jobs.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the market industry is under very considerable pressure in Europe. We should therefore be able to expect that the Member States and also the European Union will do their utmost to assist the motor industry, for example, against competition from outside the European Union that does not have to obey the same rules. Yet nothing is further from the truth.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Investment Bank granted Ford a cheap loan of EUR 100 million to start up a factory in Kocaeli in Turkey. Some sources even speak of an amount of EUR 190 million that was loaned to Ford in Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In other words, the European Union is actively financing and supporting the delocalisation of companies out of Europe, such as Ford Genk. Turkey also receives billions from the Commission in so-called pre-accession funding. It was therefore to be expected that part of all that money would also be used to take industrial activity away from Europe and move it to countries like Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="nl">How on earth has it come to this? How can you explain it to the 10 000 people in Limburg who are losing their jobs and the thousands of others in Southampton and Dagenham, for example? Are there still cases where the Investment Bank or the Commission finances factories in low-wage countries or relatively low-wage countries whereby unfair competition arises against companies in Europe? Can the Commission be more specific about the question of which funds from the Globalisation Fund can be used to reintegrate workers made redundant in Genk, for example, into the labour market and to support them? It is now time to start coming up with specific answers to these questions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I appreciate the European Commission’s proactive attitude towards the impact of the anticipated restructuring of the car industry. The crisis has taught us one thing and reminded us of a truth: that the industry is extremely important for the robustness of Europe’s economy, and the car industry is important for Europe’s industrial basis. It creates jobs not only in countries where cars are assembled, but also through the supply chain in all Member States. For instance, no car comes off a production line in Germany today without it containing, for example, parts manufactured in Romania.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the car industry is in global competition. It is a global industry which faces strong global competition, and a European or national policy can support or kill off this industry’s competitiveness. If we look, we will see that there is no Member State in the European Union which is similar to another Member State in terms of the tax regime for pollution, car registration taxes and so on, and these differences are obstacles to the development of the European car industry, obstacles in the single market. Is there nothing we can do to harmonise things a little, to eliminate these differences? In the United States, as in other countries, governments have given substantial aid to the car industry in order to innovate and switch to cars with lower carbon dioxide emissions. We need to do likewise.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it must be about two years ago that we were debating this subject here. One of the reasons then was the closure of Opel in Antwerp. At that time I was absolutely furious. First of all I was angry because so many people were losing their jobs and because of the huge impact of this on their families, but I was also angry because the Commission did not take action at that time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, a good two years later, nothing has actually changed. The Commission has still not taken any action and is to a certain extent hiding behind a number of competences that it may or may not have. Commissioner, the Commission can do many things. Let me mention three things in respect of which I really expect the Commission to act now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, when restructuring it is perfectly possible for the Commission to intervene, and at the very least speak to the multinationals and ensure that the various companies and establishments are not set against each other. Secondly, please let us make further efforts to ensure that in the future as well industry is still possible in Europe – because if we do not pay attention then a number of American multinationals will gradually pull out and establish themselves on the periphery of Europe. Thirdly – and the Ford employees in Genk are really furious about this – how on earth is it possible that we are using funds from the European Investment Bank to modernise a company outside the European Union in Turkey, in such a way that further delocalisation is possible?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, it is high time for you together with your colleagues to take real action on restructuring and on setting out the future of the industry.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, the announcement of the closure of Ford Genk can really be deemed a disaster for my province of Limburg, because no fewer than 10 000 people will directly or indirectly lose their jobs. In the community of which I shall be mayor from January, more than 700 families are affected.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now the Flemish government and the Limburg provincial authorities are working together on a plan for the future. That is excellent, but the question is: where is Europe in all this? What is Europe doing for this region? I think Europe cannot just sit and watch. With one stroke of the pen a multinational actually moves a whole factory from one European region to another, while it made a promise (only a few months ago) and it was a robust promise, on paper, regarding the future of this factory! It is clearly no longer worth the paper it is written on.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You have mentioned a number of specific measures, but I have a question for you about the Cohesion Fund. Limburg as a region needs special help, in view of the exceptional circumstances, and there are precedents: for example, Bavaria obtained an additional EUR 75 million under the current cohesion programme. Can Limburg also count on such assistance and will the Commission indicate that similar action will be taken in the short term?</p>

    <intervention id="2-608-000" speaker_id="2081" name="Peter Skinner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have three points. First, the commercial decisions taken by companies at this time amid car industry woes across the European Union, across the world, may be something which car companies can put up with, but not the people working in them. We understand of course that there is overcapacity, maybe, but promises made are not promises to be broken easily either. I represent the area of Southampton Swaythling plant, which is the assembly for the Ford Transit Van which is now to be scrapped. This will have a major impact upon that community.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also have to say that I join with my colleagues around the Chamber about the transfer of funds – EUR 100 million – for the Ford Otosan plant in Turkey. Perhaps we should ask some questions about this. After all, I know it is not public funds, but let us ask this question. There are certain people who have been involved in this, the Commission itself offers an opinion about whether or not these funds should be transferred and so do Member States. Are we that naïve that we do not believe that such a neighbourhood policy where we give funds to countries just outside the EU will not eventually lead to job transfers? Are we that silly that we do not actually wake up and realise this is going to occur? We really need to ask a question about what the remit of the EIB is in this particular issue and get down to talking about what they should and should not be allowed to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, just looking at the sight across the way from me where there are empty benches where UKIP sit, who also represent my area, it tells me very well that wrapping yourself in your national flag does nothing to protect you against global crises either and it is a shame they cannot be here to join this debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I completely agree with what you said, Commissioner: the car industry is now in difficulties; we are experiencing a long-term structural problem. Overcapacity has been around for a while. But I want to stress this point: innovation imperatives not taken seriously and not pursued today are the job losses of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">With that in mind, I really regret that the CARS 2020 communication that you mentioned, Commissioner, has been lowering the innovation ambition that the Commission has set. Two innovative projects still pursued two and a half years ago in 2010 are missing: the CO2 labelling for cars and the CO2 efficiency for heavy-duty vehicles. Why does the Commission not focus on its responsibility as an innovation agency instead of, if problems arise, playing the role of a corporate welfare agency?</p>

    <intervention id="2-610-000" speaker_id="1909" name="Bernd Lange" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I think you are being too defensive if you only examine how the consequences of plant closures and overcapacity can be remedied. No, I believe we need to examine how corporate policy can be shaped in a sensible way. The lesson is firstly that we need different forms of corporate governance. We need employees to be more involved in their companies so that sensible solutions can be found for the future of firms. This is one of the central lessons learned from the crisis: greater worker participation in companies to enable sensible solutions to be found.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, Commissioner, we in fact have 15 factories in the European Union that are running at around 50 % capacity. When I look at the global market, however, Commissioner, car production is growing from roughly 79 million to 84 million. Something is wrong here! It is unacceptable that we are de-industrialising here, while, on the other hand, the global automotive market is growing by 3 % a year.</p>
      <p sl="de">No, we do not need to just close down car factories, we need investments in future technologies to ensure that the automotive industry remains in Europe and is competitive on the global market. This also means that global corporations must be urged to exercise restraint, as they also make global investment decisions and do not necessarily place a particular emphasis on European interests. A more active role is therefore required from the European Commission!</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the CARS 2020 Communication. Finally we have some sort of industrial policy. At least the warning lights are now flashing in response to the crisis that can occur in the automotive industry and that is on the table today following the dramatic announcements of the closure of Ford factories in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Tomorrow, however, there will be more, and what we have on the table is a clear awareness that we are lacking in European instruments; that we cannot respond to this crisis country by country and by placing countries and workers in opposition to each other; that we need a truly European instrument that anticipates and prepares for technological change, globalisation and the crisis that we are suffering.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let us not allow the same situation to occur as occurred with the financial industry: that we come in afterwards with solutions but are not able to make proactive policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can see, Commissioner, that in the Communication you are finally beginning to talk about anticipation. You are already aware that yesterday the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted an own-initiative report in order for there to be a legislative act by the Commission, a real legislative act that creates guidelines at European level and European standards for responsibly managing restructuring and change, and that prioritises the participation of workers, information, anticipation, training and assistance.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, Commissioner, let us forget about this idea of this only being an issue for businesses. It is indeed an issue for businesses, but it is also an issue for workers, the regions, the Member States and Europe, whose future is at stake: its future in the world order.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore need more Europe, more solidarity, more instruments, and to face up to the situation, as the US has done, for example. We need to genuinely defend a sector that is a strategic one, in which not only are millions of jobs at stake, but also Europe’s place in the world.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, since 2008, 18 applications for mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund concerned restructuring in the automotive industry, for a sum of more than a billion, involving more than 20 000 workers. The car industry therefore represents a percentage of these mobilisations, and has done so for some years. The time has come for the Commission to decide to take action in this sector, which is in difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is the crisis the only cause of difficulties in the car sector? Have not poor management choices been made by certain companies? Could one not have foreseen the situation, realigned earlier and developed a comparative advantage on the market?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my opinion – and I agree with Alejandro – anticipation of restructuring is a necessity. Why not make the Globalisation Adjustment Fund a European tool for anticipating restructuring? The United States has a far-reaching fund and does not hesitate to use it to realign industries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have tried to introduce the concept of anticipation in the revision of the regulation, but so far without success. I believe that this new focus of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund could appeal to the Member States, and I wonder what support the Commission could provide to such an initiative for the revision of this Fund.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, at the moment, European industry as a whole is going through a difficult period, and the outlook is not at all encouraging. This is especially true of the car industry. Competitiveness in this sector needs to be stimulated, and the action plan adopted by the Commission to this end focuses precisely on innovation and making the necessary investments in this field. The plan addresses both internal and external problems, and is aimed at the regulation and relaunch of the sector. Market conditions must be improved and the car industry must be supported more in the global market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As for my country, Romania has the capacity to manufacture cars with cutting-edge industrial technology, and the new Dacia models fully confirm this. The role of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has become more important in the context of the crisis, offering support to employees within the sector.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, 5.3 % of the active population works in the automotive sector. The figures speak for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="es">The decline in sales in the European market combined with business strategy is generally leading to the externalisation and restructuring of businesses. There is an overcapacity crisis currently affecting 10 assembly plants and potentially 100 000 workers.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately few cases of restructuring have a long-term vision; generally the short-term vision takes precedence, with the main element being increasing competitiveness based on labour adjustments.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must tell you that on the same day that Ford announced the closure of its plant in Genk, it informed its business in Valencia that its production was to be transferred to Germany, in the same statement.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore believe that this is a general problem in Europe; we believe that it is essential that we create a legal framework at European level that anticipates changes and highlights the importance of social dialogue. Social dialogue is vital.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, for a long time now experts have been warning of an imminent paradigm shift, which Europe’s car manufacturers do not want to face up to. Now the automotive industry, one of the biggest industrial sectors in Europe with an annual turnover of more than EUR 700 billion, is deep in crisis, as we know.</p>
      <p sl="de">While large-volume manufacturers in particular have been struggling due to declining sales, premium manufacturers have been reporting falling profit margins. It is clear that maintaining production figures would only force the automotive industry into a vicious circle of ruinous discount battles.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although the Commission’s plan to facilitate exports of European cars sounds good on paper, it is doubtful whether European car manufacturers in the lower price segment will be able to compete with cheap Chinese cars. At best, therefore, this plan will help premium manufacturers.</p>
      <p sl="de">One thing is clear: a restructuring such as the one we witnessed recently in the United States, which destroyed tens of thousands of jobs and cancelled pension entitlements, cannot be the stated aim of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me stress again that I consider the situation at the Ford factory in Genk to be extremely serious. That is why eight days ago I received a delegation of the trade unions of this company and discussed with representatives of the employees themselves what the Commission can do in this particular situation, particularly by using the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, but also in the broader context in cooperation with the authorities of Belgium, also using the European Social Fund if allocations are available.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I also want to stress that similarly to many who have spoken in this debate, I consider the question of the industry to be extremely serious and very relevant. That is why, together with Mr Tajani, we have been working on a reinforced industrial policy for the European Union which sets out a very concrete numerical objective until 2020: to reverse the industrial decline of Europe, to increase the share of industry within the European economy to at least 20 % of the European GDP from its current level of 16%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course this requires a very concerted effort. It also requires a sectoral view when necessary and when justified and clearly the automotive sector is one of those where we need a concrete sectoral focus and an action plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact the CARS 2020 Action Plan delivers. It delivers many requirements which you mentioned in this discussion. For example, in terms of innovation, it does not lower but actually increases the ambition. It also points to the possible financing tools by which the European Union can help the revival of this sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, as Mr Harbour also pointed out, there is a need for a certain level of realism, a need to see what globalisation, global competition, cost-effectiveness means in this sector, what skills are needed in the future; and that is why the anticipation of change, the anticipation of structural development in cooperation with the social partners involved is so important in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is actually one of the key lessons of our consultation, on the basis of the Commission Green Paper, on restructuring which we conducted in the first half of this year; and on the basis of this consultation, which included a broader range of stakeholders and not only the social partners, we are very carefully considering the necessary steps forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that of course we pay very close attention to the work of Mr Cercas as rapporteur and certainly we will consider his conclusions, which I believe are forthcoming in December in this Parliament, when we decide in the Commission on the necessary steps forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I certainly take note of many points made in this debate concerning the wish for a more robust, more interventionist industrial policy. I have to admit that what is there, a 2.0 industrial policy – it has been reinforced as compared to the original version in the Europe 2020 strategy, it does a lot more in terms of innovation, in terms of human capital, in terms of access to markets, access to finance – is certainly not exactly the same type of planned economy which I heard from some of the interventions. We definitely cannot establish a planned economy retroactively and give a capacity to the European Commission to come with concrete intervention potential to cases when some of these companies, multinationals, decide to relocate.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I share your view when you say that these industrial policies should be better coordinated with the development of our financial institutions, including the European Investment Bank. Indeed, not only the Ford case but some other cases are controversial and we need to look into the decisions of the EIB and see, especially in the context of the capital increase which the Commission also has advocated in the case of the EIB; without, of course, interfering too much with the business plan of the EIB.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I think this would be justified if there is an effort in Europe to increase the financial capacity of the EIB. There should also be a discussion of how the EIB could refocus its financing actually on the European Member States and coordinate these projects better with the need to revive European manufacturing and in particular to help the relatively weaker regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">That also brings me to the questions of the MFF because several speakers, including the rapporteur, Miss Harkin, but also Mr Daerden, mentioned the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is indeed our key instrument for intervention in such cases. It is an ex post instrument, once restructuring has already been announced. But it is also an ex ante instrument because, through training, through various forms of education, promoting enterprise, it can actually prepare many workers involved for future economic or business activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is a capacity, a merit, a potential in the EGF which I hope those in the European Council will appreciate later this week when they consider the social dimension of the MFF and the instruments that can support workers who are very often the victims of careless industrial decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this has been an extremely important discussion. I would like to connect it to the morning’s discussion when we were together here with Vice-President Tajani to discuss the questions of industry and what the Commission can do for what the Vice-President calls an industrial revolution in the European Union, and I will certainly share with my colleagues the points and lessons of this debate, especially on the question of restructuring. I agree with many of you that we have a lot to do.</p>

Europe has to distance itself from the erroneous economic policy that allows production to leave our economic community. The European Union needs a patriotic economic structure in which the car industry is particularly well protected. We definitely need some form of restructuring since European societies are facing new challenges in the wake of the economic crisis. I would like to emphasise that Hungary plays a leading role in this respect, where Mercedes and Audi investments have created numerous new jobs supplemented by infrastructure developments that are of use to everyone. It is vital that local small and medium-sized enterprises be given a greater role as suppliers.</p>

    </intervention>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have had a good debate today in Parliament on the issues of industry, growth and employment, which, as the Commissioner pointed out just now, began this morning with the plenary debate with Commissioners Tajani and Andor and has effectively continued, because we talked about energy for a long time, addressing the problems faced by the automotive industry. We will now continue with a question I submitted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which will be discussed here this evening.</p>
      <p sl="it">We were given assurances that in December we would have a solution to this problem, and I believe that everything we voted on yesterday at the start of the session reinforces the attention Europe is paying to this issue. There is no doubt that a host of industrial activities are linked to the European steel industry: on the one hand, upstream, the steel, iron, cast iron and iron alloy industry, and on the other, downstream, all of the industries that use these products, particularly the automotive, mechanical engineering, building, piping and metal goods sectors, as well as maritime and naval shipbuilding, domestic appliances, chemicals and other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="it">To maintain an active and competitive steel industry is vital for the future of Europe and its citizens. Even by early 2000, Europe had already lost its supremacy, beaten by China to the top spot. In recent years, the European Union has chosen to invest heavily in environmental issues – and that is a choice we approve of – but this has doubtless led to rising costs in this sector, together with an increase in commodity prices and rocketing energy costs – let us not forget that in Europe, electricity costs 100 % more than in the United States – and for some Member States, higher borrowing costs.</p>
      <p sl="it">In 2007, European steel production reached an all-time high, with 406 000 workers directly employed in the sector and in related activities. During the period 2007-2011, we saw a 10.6 % fall in employment, and today the industry employs 363 000 workers. These are rather discouraging figures, particularly for 2012. The most worrying figure is the sharp decline in production in sectors closely linked to steel; in other words, automotive and construction, which last year alone recorded a fall in production of 3.2 %. Non-European imports are steadily rising. The administrative burden that European manufacturers must bear is high and gives rise to additional costs that reduce our capacity for investment in innovation and research, at times even resulting in relocation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Perhaps we should ask ourselves if, alongside the new strategy for industrial policy that the Commission has recently adopted, there is a need for sector policies, which seek to intervene on a case-by-case basis to reverse damaging trends that Europe can no longer afford. We know that the Commission is working on an action plan for the steel industry: what stage is this at? Having welcomed the CARS 2020 Action Plan, we would also like to see an operational plan for the steel industry that can be implemented immediately.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is perhaps worth considering whether policies could be introduced that would fully enable our strategic companies to respond to global competition. To be innovative, we should imagine the re-industrialisation of Europe being accompanied by a set of policies that need our support, such as research and innovation, which is an essential tool. However, I would also like to mention the need for a review of competition policy, which was drawn up in the 1990s and perhaps does not take into account the need for Europe’s economy to deal with a global market and global competition. The completion of the internal market is essential in order to bring down the cost of energy and special attention must be given to trade agreements with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, we should perhaps also ask ourselves whether it is worth reinstating a Council dedicated solely to industry, returning to the situation prior to 2002.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Chair of the Committee on Industry, honourable Members, the steel sector is a key sector for European industry, which employs 360 000 people, has a turnover of EUR 170 billion and occupies a key position in the manufacturing value chain. Following the restructuring efforts, and mergers and acquisitions of the 1980s and 1990s, the steel sector is today a dynamic and competitive global industry, even though it suffers from a certain number of problems.</p>
      <p sl="it">Although 12 % of the steel sold around the world is currently produced in Europe – our companies supply around 80 % of the European market and export 80 % of their output – we cannot fail to notice how, on the one hand, the economic crisis and the stagnation of the euro area, combined with increasingly high prices of raw materials and energy, represent a problem for all our companies operating in the steel sector. Added to this is the strong competition from countries, particularly in Asia, where steel can be made more cheaply. On the other hand, demand for steel products from non-EU countries is also falling, as is demand for imports. Our electricity prices are among the highest in the world: if we were to compare this with, say, the United States, electricity in Europe costs twice as much as on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must therefore address a series of problems with this general framework, which is why I have renewed the commitment I assumed before the summer recess, following a meeting with trade union representatives accompanied by the Chair, Pervenche Berès, to set up a high-level group which will prepare an action plan for the European Commission before the summer of next year. The first meeting took place on 19 September, following which the interested parties – industry and company representatives – identified the major challenges that the steel sector must face.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the key messages is finding the right balance between the objectives of the various policies so that the European steel industry remains competitive and continues to offer employment prospects, and to prevent the erosion of the steel value chain. The next meeting is scheduled for 6 December, when we will try to examine in more detail the issues covered at the first meeting. I intend to submit an action plan to the College of Commissioners before the summer recess in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am absolutely convinced that steel can and should be supported, because in our opinion this is not a structural crisis, but one linked to the general economic climate, which is why steel could again become a key player in our industrial policy over the next few years. It is no coincidence that Europe’s reindustrialisation policy covers certain sectors that need special support, particularly with innovation and significant public and private funding, high-quality sectors – such as environmentally sustainable buildings and clean vehicles – which are two of the principal customers of the steel industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, steel is an integral part of the overall strategy of the European Commission, which has set itself the target – as I have explained to the parliamentary groups and to the Council before that – of ensuring that, by 2020, 20 % of the EU’s gross domestic product will come from the manufacturing sector. Evidently we must strive to promote the latest business technologies, so that manufacturers can increase their capacity for innovation: even in the steel industry, it is still important to focus efforts on innovation. I am therefore optimistic, notwithstanding the difficulties. The European Commission is fully committed to applying itself in this sector, therefore I have asked Commissioner Andor to take part in all initiatives aimed at achieving the objective in question. My plan is twofold: (1) to anticipate the effects of a crisis that could potentially worsen, and (2) to act in concert with industry and with workers’ representatives – and with Parliament of course, as Ms Sartori and Ms Berès know, since I have always invited them to high-level group meetings on behalf of the two parliamentary committees involved in the steel strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">So: participation and consultation with all stakeholders, including the European Parliament. I believe these two words could guide us in the weeks and months ahead so that we might guarantee a future for the steel industry, which in my opinion could be a positive one. It is my belief that, if we work together intelligently, we can achieve the objective we all believe in, and which is central to the question raised by the Committee on Industry, which I have tried to answer, being in full agreement with the sentiments expressed by the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Europe is no longer competitive in certain fields. This is a fact we have to accept, but not put up with. We need to drastically reduce our dependence on regions outside Europe in such strategic industries as steel. We cannot abandon expertise that is more than 200 years old to the mere whims of the market. We need an urgent European initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore ask you seriously: what strategy are you going to adopt to prevent certain governments, like France, from carrying out lone attempts at industrial recovery which are fruitless and counterproductive, and destructive in terms of both jobs and investments?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, yes, we support you in your efforts to bolster the European steel industry. I also think it is right that trends that are also in evidence in the steel industry, namely simply reducing capacities, are not followed. Just recently I read an article in the press by the President of the European steel industry body that said that 100 000 of the close to 400 000 jobs in the industry would have to be cut, that we had to shed 25 % of capacity – a hard, deep cut.</p>
      <p sl="de">No, we cannot deal with the problem like this. We must make sure that we stabilise this core industry in the European Union and create prospects for development. This of course was a foundation stone on which the European Union was built. I would like to bring to mind the European Coal and Steel Community, which very successfully developed a research and structural policy for the steel sector. I believe that there should continue to be such a model; work on the further development of the European steel industry should involve three equally represented groups – the Commission, employers and employees.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we really need are innovations to ensure we have highly flexible steel at our disposal, particularly for the energy transition, an area in which there is undoubtedly demand. We must also ensure that the steel industry can exist in a competitive environment and is not unduly burdened with costs. You therefore have our support to stabilise the European steel industry.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, allow me first of all to spare a thought for the workers in Florange and those in Liège, the former faced with waiting for a possible buyer, and the latter faced with a social plan they consider to be hugely inadequate. Steel is nevertheless a basic backbone industry for the economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, Europe needs to be re-industrialised. It is up to you, the European Commission – and why not on 6 December – to launch a ‘Steel’ initiative linked to the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, a coordinated initiative at EU level that will make the Member States cooperate with each other instead of leaving to the large iron and steel groups the right to decide on the life or death of their subsidiaries, including those which have invested in tooling or human capital. These are large groups, which profit from fiscal non-harmonisation or, worse still, which play with the advantages they obtain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, regulation will not take place by itself. It has to be organised. It is unacceptable that CO2 emission quotas have been diverted to non-European subsidiaries and even accumulated in reserve. At EU level, there is a surplus of 950 million emission quotas; the runaway champion of all categories of this accumulation of reserves is obviously ArcelorMittal, which, in Seraing, made the reopening of a blast furnace subject to the allocation of an emission right.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to the steel question, there is obviously the issue of economic redeployment of Europe, an ambitious Europe with ambitious policies. What is certain is that this will not be done without steel, and as far as I am concerned, I would like that steel to be European.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the steel sector in Europe is experiencing a crisis in the shape of a loss of competitiveness and a rise in production costs, to a large extent arising from wrong decisions leading to the adoption of an energy and climate package that imposes a reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020. In Poland, the implementation of its provisions has caused a rise in unemployment by around 250 000 and an increase in energy prices. In view of the rise in production costs and decreased demand, there are currently plans at the Huta Sędzimira steelworks in Kraków alone to lay off more than 600 workers, and similar group redundancies are anticipated at Sosnowiec, Chorzów and Warsaw. Unless the situation changes, there will be a series of shutdowns of large furnaces and a transfer of production to Ukraine or to India, where no climatic constraints are in force. Re-starting the industry and bringing it back to Europe is unlikely to be possible. This is especially sad as the sector accounts for 7.5 % of production of the entire industry in Europe, and is one of the largest industrial employers in the European Union. Consequently the basis for the rescue package for the steel industry should be a suspension of the provisions of the energy and climate package, which is leading to the de-industrialisation of Europe. The next important factor is to block imports of cheap steel from countries of the former Soviet Union and from China. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this issue takes us to the heart of the main European contradiction: whether to serve people and their requirements and build the future, or to care only about financial profitability, dividends, free and fair competition, which destroys everything as it is based only on dumping competition?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Iron and steel: an industry at the very foundation of Europe; a sector that has enabled a very large number of industries to develop; that seeks progress; that has enabled people to acquire exceptional know-how in vehicles, rail, building, packaging and agri-food; that directly and indirectly provides millions of jobs, and indispensable wealth for our regions and our populations; a sector that has made Europe great but is in great danger.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Subjugated by finance and large international groups, our iron and steel industry is on the verge of an enormous crisis that will destroy much production capacity, witness the disappearance of know-how and destroy the lives of thousands of employees. From this perspective, the Mittal code is enlightening. It is closing sites such as those in Gandrange, Florange or Liège, in Belgium, from where it did not hesitate to transfer USD 37 billion to Luxembourg for tax optimisation purposes. It is selling wildly, keeping only that which is most profitable. At the same time, it is putting into service several blast furnaces in India, financed by the sweat and blood of European employees, whom it casts aside after thoroughly exploiting them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The independence of Europe and the future of European industry are at stake. ‘The tree is known by its fruit,’ says a French proverb. What does the Commission intend doing? Will it decide to act for Europe and finally assume its responsibilities and legislate to protect the iron and steel and industry, a major European cause for 2013?</p>

    <intervention id="2-629-000" speaker_id="28255" name="Andreas Mölzer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the current deep slump in the steel industry is undoubtedly due in the main to weaker demand from customers in the automotive industry in the debt-ridden countries of southern Europe. With prices for raw materials constantly fluctuating and energy costs increasing at the same time, this is no doubt causing a great deal of problems for steel manufacturers, and has now also affected the scrap industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the steel industry in the EU also has to contend with the highest production costs in the world. It is in fierce global competition with competitors from outside Europe who do not have to deal with such high costs relating to energy, the environment and CO2 allowances. An increasing amount of cheap steel is therefore forcing its way onto the European market from third countries that do not have such strict environmental regulations. This is something that the Commission should take into consideration with its plan to drive up the CO2 price by restricting the supply of allowances.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the European steel industry is talking about having to cut a quarter of its capacity, it should be clear to us all that, if there is an adjustment to long-term demand, this will cost up to a quarter of the jobs in Europe, that is around 100 000 jobs. If this actually happens, it should be clear to us all that the Union will need to provide tremendous assistance to cushion the social and economic effects of this restructuring.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank the Chair, Ms Sartori, for having requested this debate. The steel industry, which is fundamental for Europe, is experiencing a decline with widespread job losses. The main problem is imports from outside the EU. China is the leading supplier, although it is not alone: needless to say these countries have an unfair competitive advantage and have inadequate rules on environmental protection and workers’ rights. In general, outside the EU, rules on State aid and tariffs are varied and less restrictive, while energy costs are lower.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner Tajani, clearly we are extremely confident in the strategy for the steel industry that you are working on, and I truly thank you, partly because on numerous occasions you have said that the EU must modernise the rules on State aid and competition. I would like to mention Terni in this regard: the Terni site is part of the industrial heritage not just of Italy but of the whole of Europe. The company is one of the world’s leading producers of stainless steel. It is renowned for its high-tech processes, rigorous quality control, pollution abatement and scrap metal recycling. The European antitrust authority, to avoid dominant positions, has authorised the sale of the Terni site, the Società delle Fucine company and the LBA2 production line, leaving the Tubificio di Terni company to the Finnish company. The site used to produce 1 200 000 tonnes of goods: steel pipes are the core business of the site and without this the company risks becoming uncompetitive and unattractive to potential buyers. This is a real concern.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to finish by asking, how can we guarantee a long-term, competitive industry without jeopardising current market share and employment levels? What strategies are there to reduce energy costs? Why can we not introduce quality certification for steel products?</p>

    <intervention id="2-631-000" speaker_id="28340" name="Patrizia Toia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy crisis has taken and is continuing to take its toll on employment, on the thousands of short-term, temporary and permanent workers in this sector. The major steel conglomerates are increasingly pivoting towards the Far East or the American continent, which raises a question over the direction of our development model.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that Europe should resurrect the idea that a manufacturing sector such as ours needs a solid production base, able to supply the European internal market. We must therefore defend this sector and the role of a stable steel industry, and we must support it, Commissioner, if we want to halt the industrial decline. I think we need to move away from the dualism – which has not emerged here this evening, but which is often heard in discussions about this sector – between those who campaign to protect the environment and workers, which is misguided because it does not show us the way forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">An industry in which steel is considered to be an integral part needs the latest production systems, concrete and balanced solutions, which safeguard the various interests, the various requirements. Therefore, we need a strong European plan focusing on sustainability – on which we should never turn our backs, in my opinion – as a source of real added value, with which we can compete in the world, supporting investments, as several parties have already said, new technologies, new processes and upgrading our plants; a European economy that makes efficient use of its resources, including energy, indeed starting with energy and the search for new materials.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in Europe and in Poland there are regions in which people have been deprived of jobs, while their quondam employers are importing cheap steel from India. This is a classic example of carbon leakage, or an escape of emissions. If the European Commission keeps changing the system of emissions trading, the situation will only get worse – and that is a cause of considerable concern to us. The backloading that is proposed by the Commission is a serious problem for the steel industry today. In the opinion of some, not only shall we feel the impact of the decision on prices, but everyone knows that backloading is the first step towards structural interventions, set-aside and various other solutions of that nature.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is true that we have accepted the guidelines on aid to states, which allow indirect costs to be compensated, but everything points to Member States, at a time of crisis, simply not having the budget or the cash for such compensation. On Thursday we shall be voting on the draft decision on COP 18. The document expresses concern about the increasing level imported emissions. Before any actions at all are taken, we must be sure that what we are deciding on will genuinely help, and that we are not exporting jobs in order to import pollution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the current difficulties facing the European steel industry demand an examination of the role of the industry in EU policies. This not only concerns the limited powers of completion, shall we say, of the industry, but the overall effect of competition, trade, cohesion and fiscal policies. Although the economic crisis has highlighted the central role of manufacturing, we must move away from a system that has in recent decades put consumption before production, services before industry.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the various cases, such as the special steel manufactured at Terni and the Piombino steel plant, are food for thought in this respect. In terms of competition policy, for example, we should maintain a global, and not just a European, outlook when evaluating dominant positions. With regard to this particular question, I believe it is important that we guarantee the integrity of the Terni site during the current sale and hive-off by Outokumpu of its steel pipe business.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of fiscal policy, the measures contained in June’s Growth Pact must be implemented swiftly, encouraging fiscal consolidation to bolster growth and thus safeguard the role of public investment in European fiscal policy. Finally, there is the question of rules on State aid, which should be recast to encourage bridging finance aimed at securing the future of manufacturing at sites deemed to be strategic.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it breaks my heart to witness the gradual and almost inexorable closure of the iron and steel production site in my native town, Schifflange, which at the moment still employs about 70 people, whereas at the beginning of the 1980s, 3 000 employees brought the site to life. A piece of history and a memory are disappearing, and I am in a very good position to share the sadness – and also the anger – of thousands of people, both here and elsewhere. I will not, however, harp on the usual subject of the wicked capitalists who shut down factories to feed shareholders who are already too fat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The exceptional economic crisis, the fall in demand, production overcapacity, and also the European regulatory frenzy that undermines our competitiveness, are indisputable facts and I will not make unjust accusations against the economic decision-makers. However, I am aware of the devastating effects of the closures of iron and steelworks sites on both jobs and European industrial know-how.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time to respond, not by making unrealistic promises, but by embarking on a European industrial policy worthy of the name. As Europeans, we have strategic interests to defend and the iron and steel industry is certainly an industrial element. Industrial policy certainly does not mean protectionism or closing borders, but Europe must not be a sieve, a market open on all sides. Our main partners are showing us the way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning iron and steel we, as the European Union, must aim to define minimum rules so as not to bleed dry an industry that will pick up again one day, when the economic situation improves. There is something irreparable in what is happening today. A European industrial policy could remedy this perfectly without affecting the essential competitiveness of European industry compared to other parts of the world.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, let us not hesitate to repeat that iron and steel remains a sector of the future. Our workers in this sector have developed real know-how. Steel is the raw material of the manufacturing industries we would all like to re-launch, like the car industry. It is a sector that provides jobs and contributes greatly to structuring the economic fabric and in which major investments have been made, often with the participation of the public sector, in research and development of new iron and steel products with a high added value.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us take an enlightening example of the drifts of the large groups. For several years, the ArcelorMittal group has been putting in place, in the Moselle-Luxembourg-Liège iron and steel basin, a strategy of gradual destruction of production capital. What are the foundations of this strategy? The group is shutting down production sites that are still profitable, but plays on competition between these sites to redirect their investments. It rejects the idea of selling the tooling, which still offers good performance, to prevent it being taken over by a potential competitor. We must act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is sometimes prompt to defend the rules of fair and healthy competition. Is it not unfair competition to prevent a recovery? Could the Commission not study those cases too?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, here are three debates one after the other in our order of business, in which you are at the heart of the discussion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have led some of these debates with Commissioner Andor, which is right, as they discuss industrial policy, which is also at the heart of European jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, a key figure is missing from your debate – that is, Commissioner Barnier – because it is evident that, behind several strategies that are at play, it is strategies for financing the economy that lead to the unravelling of the industrial fabric of our regions, and it is also the stitch you will need to knit, if you will permit the expression. I therefore thank you for having taken the initiative of this working group, which is a logical link between the reasoning on raw materials and that on the car industry. What is required is a global strategy that combines the issue of research and development with the issue of quality and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am always struck by the extent to which Europeans have been mobilised and shocked at the idea that they could no longer control access to rare earths as if it were a strategic issue, rather like what the Americans have sometimes done. Yet when considering the issue of iron and steel, Europeans do not consider it just as strategic for our economies. We allow Mr Mittal to behave simply like a financier and, contrary to everything we have learned in our economics textbooks, rather than create added value, he tries to go up the added value chain by destabilising and destroying production units on the European sites so he can go and buy mines, where he can organise speculation better.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to put two questions to Commissioner Tajani. I do not want to repeat what my colleagues have said – much although certainly not all of which I agree with – on the strategic importance of steelworks in Europe. We often lament this, not realising, Commissioner Tajani, that the world has changed. When we talk, as many of my colleagues have, about dominant positions – in other words, antitrust – we forget that we still have laws that date back to 1957, when the world was divided in two: Europe on one side and the United States on the other. Today the world has completely changed: there are different situations, new markets such as India, China and Brazil, and competition which is – admittedly – at times unfair.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wonder, Commissioner, do we want to amend the old, antiquated, outdated laws? My second question is, when mergers are not possible, what do we do; will the Commission help these companies avoid speculation?</p>

Steelworks, as major energy consumers, are even more crippled by the European Commission’s decision to withdraw some of the ETS quotas already distributed and its determination to set a minimum price for future auctions.</p>
      <p sl="it">This decision by the European Commission, which I criticised during a debate within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will mainly affect the steelworks themselves, which already lost 10 % of their market share in 2011 and in 2012 stand to lose a further 12 %. The only solution to avoid unfair competition from third countries is to impose import tariffs, in proportion to the difference in the cost of steel production in Europe and in the third country.</p>

      <p sl="it">Commissioner Tajani, yesterday afternoon the whole of Piombino, a town in my region, Tuscany, ground to a halt for several hours. In total, 10 000 people took to the streets: workers, pensioners, retailers, artisans, business owners, the unemployed and ordinary citizens, issuing a cry for help that today I would like to bring before the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The town risks dying because of the crisis facing the steel industry, which has supported Piombino for decades.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lucchini is the hardest hit company, and this could result in thousands of job losses, with repercussions on the entire economy and on the local community. We would therefore like the European Union to send out a strong signal to save the European steel industry, which today faces enormous difficulties and fierce competition, particularly from Asia. In 1951, European integration as we know it today began from steel: it is only fair and right therefore that European institutions should act to protect and save this sector, which should still be regarded as a strategic priority.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, it is clear that the contributions of all Members who have taken to the floor this evening focus on the competitiveness of European industry. The steel sector – as I said in my first intervention, in response to the question from Ms Sartori – is a key element. Competing at a global level evidently means having to deal with a reality that has completely changed compared to the past, as many Members have pointed out during this debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why, during the last Competitiveness Council, we discussed the issue of industrial policy, its strength at a global level and the problems that exist in a context that has changed since the 1950s. A debate is also under way within the Commission: I have received a letter on this very subject from seven industrialised countries – from Luxembourg to France, Italy and Germany – which are insisting that we have a debate on this issue, as well as on the issue of State aid.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner Almunia, who is responsible for competition policy, intends to present a draft reform. The Commission has also begun a debate, because we do not wish to be left behind. At the same time, we must remember that competition laws are fundamental for growth and that we must protect the internal market. However, if I have understood Members correctly, this is an issue that we must discuss and reflect on over the months ahead, if we want our industry to be competitive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Internal market policy – in response to Ms Berès – must also be part of this initiative: Commissioner Barnier is undoubtedly one of the strongest advocates of a European industrial policy, and I have always been able to count on his support for all the initiatives I have sought to adopt, including the one on steel. This leads me to say that a reversal is under way at a political level in Europe: I mention the 20 % target, because alongside the 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions and the 20 % renewables target, there is also the target of 20 % of GDP linked to industrial policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Evidently, there is still much to be done in the steel sector, such as the question of ETS raised by several Members. The Commission has already given a positive response regarding compensation: we have reached a stage where up to 85 % of the amount of State aid in this sector has been authorised, and we have included all of the most important industrial segments, including steel.</p>
      <p sl="it">Conversely, with regard to back-loading, the European Commission has unveiled a specific proposal and the ball is now in the court of the European Parliament, whose opinion will be decisive because without the support of Parliament and the Council, nothing can be achieved in this sector. However, I have taken note of the concerns raised, although we need to act in a way – which I believe to be possible – that reconciles environmental policy and industrial policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would now like to reply to Ms Durant …</p>
      <p sl="fr">… and I do so in French. The new framework programme and Horizon 2020 will offer new opportunities for financing research and development and progressing towards more efficient production in terms of resources and energy. The iron and steel industry, together with other industries, has already submitted a proposal for a new public-private partnership called SPIRE. I think that these credits can also be used in future financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even regarding access to raw materials – an issue I raised but which Ms Merkies talked about in her intervention, as echoed by Ms Berès – I definitely do not think that the question of rare earth elements is the only problem. However, a strategy for raw materials is fundamental for the steel sector. As you know, we have signed a series of agreements with non-EU countries, paving the way for the Innovation Partnership on the replacement, recycling and extraction of raw materials. This is a strong initiative which will be financed as part of the current and upcoming financial perspectives, in which the European Parliament will be closely involved.</p>
      <p sl="it">Regarding Terni, I believe Commissioner Almunia has acted in strict compliance with current legislation. The fact the Terni industrial site has remained united and whole is, I think, a good thing, and will enable it to be sold: fragmenting it would have been much riskier in terms of protecting the site; keeping it whole at least means being able to place it on the market with more guarantees for the protection of jobs and know-how. In terms of the steel pipes business, admittedly this has not been included with the rest of the site; however, this is not strictly related – even from a geographical point of view – in view of the willingness, it appears to me, of the current owner to sell the business. Therefore, I believe the problem that was highlighted by Ms Angelilli can be resolved by protecting this industrial site, which is important not only for Italy, but for the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must stress the importance of having an industrial policy for the Union. We will discuss this again at the next Competitiveness Council on 10 December – a Competitiveness Council to which we would like to assign greater importance, and strengthen the role of industrial policy and industry representatives. I would like to thank the Cypriot presidency for its help with this initiative. On the evening of 9 December I also intend to meet with industry ministers to tackle the subject of the automotive crisis, which is closely linked to the issue of the steel crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission is absolutely determined to protect our industry, to make it more modern and competitive, more environmentally sustainable, but also, of course, to make it instrumental in exiting the crisis and safeguarding jobs. I am utterly convinced that the sacrifices we have demanded from our fellow citizens will be absolutely essential. However, unless these sacrifices are accompanied by a strong growth policy – and thus by a strong industrial policy – they risk being not only ineffective but above all harmful to our citizens. This is why it is important to tackle both fronts simultaneously. It is my responsibility and aim to defend the growth policy throughout the European Union, while protecting, strengthening and rendering the steel industry more competitive.</p>

      <p sl="fr">To ask those who for 60 years have not stopped dismantling the European iron and steel industry what future they envisage for it is like ordering an educational project from Fourniret. These are the same people who, in 2006, in the name of the sacrosanct competition policy, approved Mittal’s hostile takeover bid of Arcelor, harshly criticised anyone who denounced the absence of industrial plans on the part of the Indian billionaire and rejected any national, or even European, strategic vision. The result of your management? Now the great majority of the iron and steel industry is in the hands of non-European multinational firms that give preference to short-term profitability and search for the lowest possible costs, especially in their countries of origin. However, the iron and steel industry is strategic. To apply common Brussels law to it condemns to unacceptable foreign dependence many other industrial sectors that provide millions of jobs, such as the automotive and construction sectors, and symbolises the absence of a European industrial plan. The reaction of France, which asks that strategic multinational companies take into account the concerns of the Member States, is pitiful: as he demonstrated by his first merger-acquisition, Mr Mittal does not care. These multinationals serve only their owners-shareholders. Unless it is a shareholder itself, the state can do nothing. However, those sacrificed in Gandrange, Florange, Dunkirk and, sadly, elsewhere will appreciate it.</p>

      <p sl="es">I would like to express my concern, as I have before, that Europe, its public authorities and private undertakings did not, at the time, avoid and resist the magnate Mr Mittal, who is now provoking European workers and relocating his activities.</p>
      <p sl="es">A genuine EU policy must, as the Vice-President of the Commission said, reindustrialise Europe and prevent relocations and the constant threats and provocations by Mr Mittal against the stability of some of the best-trained workers in the world, in steelworks that should not be closed but strengthened in order to come through the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The steel industry accounts for 1.4 % of European gross domestic product. The destructuring of the European steel industry, together with the increase in steel imports from third countries which are not subject to the same stringent environmental regulations, have caused job losses in Europe. As a result, the workforce within the steel sector has decreased from 1 million employees in 1970 to approximately 408 000 employees in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In 2010 EU steel exports reached 33.7 million tonnes, the main importers being Turkey, the United States, Algeria, Switzerland, Russia and India, and the Union’s steel imports amounted to 26.8 million tonnes, the main exporters being Russia (6.5 million tonnes), Ukraine (5.7 million tonnes), China (3.6 million tonnes), Turkey (1.8 million tonnes), South Korea, Switzerland and Serbia. Against the background of the economic crisis, the steel industries of Romania, Belgium, Sweden and Bulgaria have been worst affected.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Steel is the most used material in the world owing to its strength, flexibility and multiple uses, and production amounted to 1.4 billion tonnes in 2010. The Union needs a competitive steel industry capable of providing jobs within Europe. I call on the Commission and the Member States to help the steel industry to modernise, because only by causing less pollution and becoming more energy-efficient can it remain internationally competitive.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission concerning the forthcoming World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT-2012) and the possible expansion of the scope of international telecommunications regulations.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-649-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Loucas Louca" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, the international telecommunications regulations concern matters relating to international, not national telecommunications services. However, there are aspects of the regulations that have a direct bearing on the acquis of the European Union, and specifically on the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union ought to ensure that any changes made to the regulations, as a result of the WCIT world conference in Dubai, do not contradict the legislation in force in the European Union. In addition, it must be guaranteed that the WCIT will not under any circumstances restrict the European Union in terms of the future development of the Community acquis .</p>
      <p sl="el">As representative of the Presidency of the Council, I am here today to assure you that the Council fully supports the two objectives which have been set in the lead-up to the World Conference, namely the effort to avoid and resolve any clash with the EU acquis and the provision of assurances that the EU acquis will be able to develop as we choose in the future. The 27 Member States which are to participate and negotiate at the WCIT as full members will convey and defend these two messages before the 163 other member states of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which is organising this world conference.</p>
      <p sl="el">The 27 Member States have undertaken to make every possible effort to ensure that the end result of the WCIT reflects the priorities of the European Union and existing commitments.</p>
      <p sl="el">As you know, the preparatory process for the WCIT is quite complex. Of particular importance for the European Union are the ITU working group and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). The EU Member States and the European Commission have actively participated in this preparatory process, where they took the same line. The European Commission will also take part in the WCIT as an observer, and not a full negotiating member. Under the ITU rules, full participation is granted only to the representations of the ITU member states. However, in order to derive greater benefit from the Commission’s presence at the WCIT as part of the effort to promote objectives or regulate matters affecting the European Union, we shall ask the WCIT organisers to accept the European Union, through the Commission, as an observer in an advisory role. Although this arrangement will not allow the Commission to negotiate on the proposals, it will nevertheless enable it to request the floor during the negotiations, after ITU member states have spoken, in order to provide useful advice or information on points which have a bearing on, and are in line with, the European Union’s position.</p>
      <p sl="el">Since the start of the Cyprus Presidency, we have been discussing the Commission’s proposal, which essentially was fully supported by the Council and which consists in attempting to avoid or resolve any conflict with the EU acquis and ensuring that the EU acquis can be developed as we choose. The Commission also proposed that the European Union, represented by the Commission, should negotiate a revision of the regulations at Dubai. On this last point, however, we must recognise that the ITU rules do not allow the European Union to participate in the WCIT as a full negotiating member. Whether the Commission participates as an observer, or participates as an observer in an advisory capacity, the ITU rules do not allow observers to submit proposals or to negotiate positions. The decision on whether to allow the Commission to participate as an observer in an advisory capacity will be taken by the chairman on the first day of the conference in Dubai.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me stress that the Council fully recognises that the Commission must present the Union’s position while recognising that only the Member States of the European Union are able to negotiate proposals. These are the ITU rules and the Council cannot change them. What is important is that the Commission and Member States should cooperate closely to ensure that in Dubai the position of the European Union is presented correctly, consistently and promptly, on the basis of the collective expertise of the conference participants representing the Member States of the European Union. It is therefore particularly important that we should take care to coordinate effectively on this, so that we are in a position to respond promptly and effectively on the many proposals which ITU members intend to submit.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Cyprus Presidency has prepared an informal document, which was discussed in the Council, setting out practical arrangements for better cooperation and coordination of the actions of the 27 Member States and the European Commission during the conference. For this purpose, the Cyprus Presidency and the European Commission jointly organised a meeting which was held on Friday, 16 November in Brussels, with the heads of the national representations of the Member States or their Dubai representatives. At this meeting, there was an in-depth discussion of questions of practical cooperation and coordination of actions with a view to better representation of the European Union at the conference.</p>
      <p sl="el">I hope my answers regarding the procedural aspect of the WCIT have adequately covered the issues which Ms Verheyen raised in her oral question.</p>
      <p sl="el">On the main issue, regarding internet regulation and charges to internet content providers, it is enough to say that at the WCIT they will agree that the ITU should regulate the internet and that telecommunications providers will be able to charge internet content providers. This is a development which is contrary to the European Union’s primary aim at the WCIT, because the results are not compatible with the acquis of the European Union, and it is not anticipated that they will become compatible in the future.</p>
      <p sl="el">The common European positions reflect the joint European proposals, which will be submitted by the CEPT at the conference; these take account of, and are consistent with, the European acquis . I would like to end with the observation that when the international telecommunications regulations were adopted in 1988, this happened in an environment of traditional networks on the basis of leased connections; in other words, providing for separate services on separate networks. Nowadays, to an ever-increasing degree, there is a single IP-based infrastructure for providing all the services, regardless of whether they are voice, video or data, on a single device. In addition to this, there has been a dramatic rise in mobile telephony and increased network congestion due to the increase in data traffic, particularly video data traffic.</p>
      <p sl="el">All these developments create challenges for the structure of today’s communications systems and for the rules governing those systems, both in the developed and in the developing world. The Council is fully committed to making every possible effort to ensure that the outcome of the WCIT is fully in harmony with the acquis of the European Union and with the EU objective of further expanding the digital economy in the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="2-650-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this evening I am replacing the Vice-President, Commissioner Kroes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The internet we know and use today was able to be developed organically because of the free rein given to the need for creative and innovative talent, which created the infrastructure and its content for the benefit of all citizens. The internet is also a source of jobs and economic growth, both in Europe and in the developing world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the next World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai, a revised treaty may introduce more restrictive regulations on the internet. Regulation of the internet would risk harming innovation and growth in this field, which has contributed so much to the world economy. It would risk restricting the growth of traffic and circulation of data, increasing costs, creating administrative constraints and limiting the creation of new enterprises. It is not in the interest of our industry to stifle the large capital represented by the internet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is even more important to note that a large number of countries which are aiming for greater regulation of the internet, through the Dubai processes, do not share the same values and respect for human rights as the European Union. Opening the door to stricter internet control for these countries involves a high risk of undermining freedom of expression, protection of private life and legitimate exercise of political dissidence. It is therefore important to reject all suggestions of this bent. This is why the European Union should oppose a widening of the current scope of regulations on international telecommunications, in particular with regard to content and control of traffic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission participated actively in the conference preparations. We are expecting very difficult negotiations in Dubai, bearing in mind the positions of other countries and their expectations of a new treaty. Having said that, a large number of countries are of the same mind as the European Union and I am optimistic that an inappropriate and excessively restrictive regulation will be avoided. Great vigilance and good coordination between us, and also a lot of work, are essential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission is happy that ETNO, the European Telecommunications Network Operators Association, has supported the position of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations, which stipulates that provisions on IP interconnections have no place in the regulation of international telecommunications.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission’s proposal for a Council decision on a common position of the European Union for the World Conference on International Telecommunications was adopted on 2 August 2012 and was passed on to the Council and European Parliament. Our position is to make sure that any change to the regulations on international telecommunications does not affect the common rules of the European Union or their scope. The Commission and the European Union are of the opinion that this is not the appropriate platform for defining pricing and compensation systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the moment, the absence of specific regulations on telecommunications and the internet allows the European Union to take legislative or regulatory measures concerning internet neutrality that we, the European Union, consider necessary. The Member States will soon adopt a revised version of this proposal submitted by the President. The Commission notes that the Member States have indicated their support for the Commission’s position and that this type of initiative would be detrimental to the future development of the internet as an open and innovative communication platform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the Commission wishes to express its regret that Member States have not been able to reach agreement on institutional issues concerning representation of the European Union as envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union needs to speak loudly to ensure a positive result to the negotiations in Dubai.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why the Commission will make every effort to defend the European Union’s position as strongly as possible during negotiations at the World Conference on International Telecommunications.</p>

    <intervention id="2-651-000" speaker_id="96756" name="Sabine Verheyen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, in December the World Conference on International Telecommunications will develop and discuss new standards. Until now the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has had the task of determining competences, interoperability and technical standards. Certain countries, such as China, Russia and a number of Arabic and African states, would like more internet governance competences to be transferred to the ITU and governance structures for the internet to be included in the review of the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITR).</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to make it clear in our resolution that we explicitly reject this, as it could allow basic rights such as the freedom of speech, freedom of information and commercial development potential to be restricted. Under certain conditions the internet would lose its independence. In the past, free access to the internet and the discrimination-free transmission of data have unleashed great potential for commercial development, the dissemination of cultural and creative content and the exchange of knowledge and should continue to do so in the future. The internet has become an established part of democratic structures. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular have been able to tap into new markets via the internet.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are therefore asking the Council and Commission not to expand the competences of the ITU to internet governance in the course of the negotiations at the WCIT and to work towards securing the aims of the EU of further developing the internet into an open network, paying particular attention to human rights and fundamental freedoms, and exploiting the commercial development potential it offers! The architecture of the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance has proved to be successful and should be developed further in the future. I would therefore like to ask the Commission and Council to coordinate a common line in the negotiations on the ITR and to represent the European position effectively – in the interests of the basic rights of citizens, development potential and freedoms!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in this Parliament we prevented the adoption of ACTA some time ago. We have voted consistently on the freedom and openness of the internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that at the coming World Conference on International Telecommunications in December 2012 we have to maintain a very strong stance. I really think that the European Union is expected to adopt a common position on the basis of a very good proposal which has already been submitted by the European Commission. We are going to participate in negotiations in the framework of a UN body which is the International Telecommunications Union. We have different countries with different interests participating in this body.</p>
      <p sl="en">The internet is a very strong tool nowadays. There are many countries that would like to control it because they are afraid of the strength of internet and the people using internet. We have different examples of countries or organisations that want to establish control of the internet, for example, changing the business model and making it more expensive and less accessible and with more monopolies working on it. There were some governments which some time ago wanted to create a national internet, the very idea of which is an oxymoron. Such a thing is not possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I have also heard of some proposals that are going to be presented, most probably at this conference, coming from Russia – which is a very powerful state – saying that member states should have the sovereign right to regulate the activities of operating agencies providing internet. That is the end of the freedom of the internet. There are proposals saying that member states should have the sovereign right to manage the internet within their national territory. What does it mean to manage the internet on the national territory and what does it mean to link the internet with the sovereign rights of the country? There are proposals saying that member states should have equal rights in deciding about internet addresses and domain names. This is the end of the current system of multi-stakeholders regulating the internet. It is not possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we insist on a common position for the European Union and a very strong involvement of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have heard a lot about rules. I want to say a bit about the gist of the debate on this resolution and the context in which it is taking place.</p>
      <p sl="de">The internet and technologies have changed people’s lives around the world, empowering them to access information, to express themselves freely, to assemble and to document human rights violations, for example; and for businesses and entrepreneurs, too, the opportunities are very exciting. With the help of technology, it is easier to challenge monopolies, including powers that have traditionally lain in the hands of government and media.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time we have to be careful that no new monopolies emerge.</p>
      <p sl="de">Revolutionary change never comes without protest from those with a vested interest: businesses that want to secure their profitable models; governments that want to control people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Multinational organisations are the new arena for battles of this kind. The International Telecommunications Union may have been a technical and somewhat obscure organisation dealing with standards, but these standards are increasingly being used in political fights and in the re-territorialisation of the internet in the grip of nation states, and the standards are also being tweaked to protect business models.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under the guise of fighting spam, speech has been stifled; and, in the name of cyber security, online surveillance has dramatically increased. Banning ‘voice over Internet Protocol’ services hampers free speech by criminalising it, as in Africa, or throttling it, as was the case in the Netherlands – which is why my party pushed for enshrining net neutrality in law.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our resolution addresses some of the most urgent concerns relating to internet governance. Some argue that this is actually a contradiction in terms, but what is certainly true is that the internet has developed into the fruitful platform it is today without much regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today we are talking specifically about the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which will host the World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai, and it makes sense to update the system of regulation because this has not been done for a very long time. However, we should bear in mind that the ITU’s recommendations are non-binding documents that promote best practices.</p>
      <p sl="de">Each of the 27 EU Member States has a vote, and if the EU wants to be a global player – if we want our voice to be heard – we must speak out loudly as one, and we should further the development of the internet as a truly public sphere in which fundamental freedoms are guaranteed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, colleagues, I am very happy that Parliament has taken the time to discuss the issue of the upcoming World Conference on International Telecommunications. Too often when important positions on how we can communicate or not are taken at an international level, they escape the eye of the public and they do not get sufficient attention. I do believe that Parliament has shown in this last week that it is able to represent the interests of the public when it comes to international telecommunications.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have drafted a resolution which shows very clearly where the Parliament stands on issues of regulating the internet and information and communication technologies. We also addressed the issue of transparency in the WCIT and ITU processes that was brought up by the Council earlier this evening.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think there is a broad agreement in this House with the Commission and with the Council that the most important task is to defend the freedom of the internet and I think it is extremely good to hear how deep that agreement is.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know, and it has been said here, that the freedom of internet has been a pre-condition for the development of the internet as such. We all know that the freedom of the internet has meant the freedom of information, the freedom of expression. The freedom of the internet has changed our societies, is changing our societies and will change our societies – provided we are able to keep it free and independent.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know that there are a lot of forces, a lot of regimes who would like to hinder this development, just for the reasons we have pointed to, because they are afraid of the freedom of expression. They are afraid of the freedom of information and that is why the European Union must be extremely clear and must take a decisive line to defend this freedom and independence.</p>
      <p sl="en">But also to secure that we do not give any excuses for those who would like to intervene. It is important that we do not give opportunities to block services or accept that this is being done anywhere else because that will always be used by those forces and those regimes that are most eager to hinder the freedom of expression and the freedom of information, but who are also blocking the importance of the internet itself. We will see the same changes in the future as we have seen in the past and the best way to secure the internet is that we defend it against any regime that wants to hinder its development. I appreciate that the Council and Commission as well as the political groups here have been so decisive on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have recalled in this chamber, next December the United Nations agency responsible for communications technology and information will meet in Dubai for the ITU World Conference on International Telecommunications. The aim is to renegotiate the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs). We cannot forget – I am pleased at the words used by Commissioner Tajani – the work that has been done so far, which cannot be up for debate, nor can we allow the authority of the European Union to be bypassed by a supranational organisation such as the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), to which, as we know, hundreds of States around the world belong, many of which are renowned for having problems linked to democracy, transparency and freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are not mistaken therefore in thinking that the pillars of the internet – in other words, freedom, participation, openness and innovation – are under threat. I believe it is necessary to safeguard the role of the internet and, more importantly, the role that the internet can have in reviving economic growth, as well as guaranteeing opportunities for all. Therefore, I hope the Commission will endeavour to ensure that in Dubai, Europe presents a united front and speaks with one voice.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are many controversial proposals on the table for the World Conference on International Telecommunications, particularly those that propose changes to internet governance that call into question the neutrality of the internet, with negative repercussions for consumers. The freedom of the internet or, more specifically, the freedom of expression and data protection, are therefore at risk. What some States have proposed would entitle a government to monitor not only the communications of its citizens, but even the data exchanged over its networks. It is a very small step from here to the curtailment of freedom of expression and censure, therefore I believe it is contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, as I ran a little over time with my initial address, I shall be very brief. Given the importance of conferences such as the WCIT for the future of the digital agenda in Europe, the views of all the institutional bodies are welcome. We will also need to have a clear understanding of the role to be played by these conferences which cover such a wide constituency and a sector in which the technology and content are evolving so quickly. For this reason, micro-regulation must be avoided and, conversely, there is a need to ensure that the revised regulations will maintain a high standard and that they will remain strategically and technologically neutral. I would like to thank you for the interest you have shown in the WCIT and for your willingness to approve this resolution. To conclude, I would like to repeat that the Presidency is fully committed to facilitating the representation of the European Union’s views in Dubai – views which will be in line with the acquis and will favour a more dynamic digital Europe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the second-generation Schengen information system (SIS II) is a basic tool for the security of the European area without internal border checks, and is one of the most tangible and significant achievements of European integration. SIS II will replace the existing system, which is able to serve the needs of a limited number of Member States and respond to a limited number of demands. Improved technology will give the new Schengen information system new functions and will enable it to meet a greater number of requests, thus strengthening the security of the Schengen area and its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="el">In May 2012, the Commission presented its proposal for revision of the two existing legal acts governing the transition from Schengen Ι+ to the new SIS II. The Presidency, aware that this is a necessary step in the transition process, has worked intensively to move things forward quickly, with a view to reaching an agreement on the text of the proposal. The discussion on the Council’s proposal resulted in a change to the legal structure of the Commission’s original proposal, in order to bring it into line with the standard policy which is followed for legal proposals in which Ireland and the United Kingdom are participating, and in order to ensure a more transparent procedure.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Presidency expresses its thanks to the rapporteur and the European Parliament for all the efforts they have made to ensure prompt adoption of the reports on the proposals; this in turn enables the Council to proceed with the final adoption of the proposals. As you will have noticed, more generally, the Commission has taken responsibility for developing and completing SIS II, and the deadline for the operational launch of the system is still the end of the first quarter of 2013, according to the latest overall schedule drawn up by the Commission. The adoption of the legal proposals governing the transition will constitute a further substantial step towards achieving the aim of launching the operation of SIS II in the first quarter of 2013. This also means that both the central system and all the national systems will need to be in place during that period. The Commission regularly updates the Council on the progress of SIS II, and a further update is expected at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 and 7 December. I hope that by then it will have become clear whether the aim of completing the system around the end of March 2013 remains feasible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, SIS II is a major milestone in the completion of the area of freedom, security and justice. I look forward to what I hope will be a positive vote tomorrow on the migration instrument recast proposal. This is essential in laying down both the migration procedure and the underlying legal framework, and is indispensable for SIS II to become operational.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the Civil Liberties Committee for their constructive spirit and cooperation throughout the procedure. The Commission aims to guarantee the highest level of data protection throughout the migration. The proposal by the European Parliament in this area provides further clarity and can, therefore, be strongly supported by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission regards data cleansing as a priority and has on several occasions made Member States aware of the crucial importance of this issue in order to avoid substantial numbers of rejected alerts by the new system. On this basis, the Commission can also support the relevant amendments put forward in the reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to enhance transparency, the Commission is ready to provide the European Parliament with information about the testing activities laid down in the proposal as well as about the completion of the migration. Under Article 18 of the migration instruments, the Commission will deliver progress reports to the European Parliament and to the Council every six months concerning the technical development of SIS II and migration-related activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Commission cannot support the inclusion of requirements obliging Member States to delete non-migrated data, as these data are subject to national law and the supervision of the national data protection authorities in accordance with the Schengen Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Undeniable progress has been made in the SIS II project over the last two years at both central and national level. The Commission has already informed the Parliament of the successful completion of the Milestone 2 test earlier this year and of the very good performance of the central system and most national systems during the last round of testing, known as the comprehensive test. So I would like to underline the fact that we are actually very close to completion.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is unfortunately not the case for Finland, where there has been a slight delay in completing its national system. The Finnish authorities notified the Commission of this in late October in a letter from the Finnish Interior Minister. Commissioner Malmström raised this issue as an urgent matter for Finland to address at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council a few days later.</p>
      <p sl="en">Immediately after the JHA Council, the Commission organised a fact-finding mission to Finland to assess the extent of the difficulties encountered by their national project. A number of risk mitigation actions were agreed with Finland, which could, alongside the assistance that will be provided to their experts, minimise the impact on the overall project schedule but cannot prevent some delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s services are analysing in detail the implications of the problem encountered by Finland. On the basis of the detailed information requested from Finland on its remedial action plan, the Commission’s intention is to present a new timetable to the December JHA Council on 6 and 7 December 2012 and, of course, to inform the Parliament at the same time.</p>

    <intervention id="2-665-000" speaker_id="1892" name="Carlos Coelho" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, we agree that the Schengen Information System (SIS) is the most important instrument for the security of the Schengen area. We consider it to be the backbone of a Europe without borders and the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For several years the European Parliament has advocated a clear Community solution, rejecting the continuation of an intergovernmental set-up. That is one of the reasons why we have always supported SIS II. However, besides this, in an enlarged Europe of 27 Member States, we need the increased security that SIS II provides, in guaranteeing stricter border controls by introducing biometric data, and allowing for more efficient use of data through the possibilities offered by such interconnection.</p>
      <p sl="pt">SIS II will also provide a more stringent level of data protection than that which currently exists in SIS I.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The reports that we will vote on tomorrow allow us to clarify the legal framework applicable to the migration from SIS I to SIS II, enabling the legal framework for SIS II to enter into force and be applied from the moment the first Member State carries out this transfer.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given the political importance of this dossier, as well as its budget, the Parliament, despite deploring the fact that it was only consulted, but to avoid further delays, approved the proposals, proposing changes to strengthen the rules on data protection, guarantee effective supervision and enable the Member States requiring this still to take advantage of the existing budget line for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We should now be highlighting the fact that, finally, after so many years, the end is in sight – since it was expected that the new system could start in January and that SIS II would be operational from April. However, as incredible as it may seem, we have been faced with a further delay, in a system that should already have been operational since 2007. This time it is not the fault of the European Commission, but rather the Member States – the Member States that have always criticised the Commission over the last few years for having caused delays and having spent a lot of money on this project. As the Vice-President of the Commission has already stated, it was Finland. After all, Parliament was right to reject the proposal to withdraw any reference to the date for the entry into force of the system.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I call on the Member States, and in particular Finland, to discharge their responsibilities in this process and avoid SIS II having to suffer yet another delay. And I ask the Council and the Commission what they intend to do to address this additional setback, so as to ensure that SIS II enters into force as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the reports which we are debating this evening on migration to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) were adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by way of a simplified procedure in order to make both the legal instruments and the funds necessary for the switchover to the new SIS generation available to the Commission and the Member States as quickly as possible. Sadly, this spirit of good faith and good cooperation on the part of Parliament stands in stark contrast with the attitude of certain Member States which say that they are disinterested in the success of SIS II.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I sincerely share with you my personal frustration and that of the European Parliament as a whole at this never-ending problem which is the Schengen Information System II. It is already ridiculous that an information system, even a complex one, should take more than 12 years to be developed and implemented, and even now the Member States and the Commission are unable to fulfil their commitments and are repeating past mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have, in this case, a worrying lack of responsibility on the part of both Finland, which is showing a lack of interest in carrying out some simple tests, and the Commission. The basic precondition imposed on the Commission by Parliament for the disbursement of funds for the development of SIS II was the Commission’s commitment to comply with and carefully supervise the migration process. Unfortunately, I see that the Commission has not lived up to this commitment. All of these things once again highlight the reasons why the whole management of the Schengen Area needs to be changed and Europeanised.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If we had an efficient Union evaluation mechanism, all of these delays could have been avoided and action could have been taken to correct such problems as Finland’s far more promptly. Finally, I wish to point out the irony of the situation of Romania and Bulgaria, candidate countries which, although they meet all of the requirements of the acquis for access to the Schengen Area, have not been allowed to join, yet an old Schengen Member State is having serious problems in complying with the acquis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, oh dear, SIS II has been hit by the curse of large IT projects, especially in the field of home affairs!</p>
      <p sl="de">We are rather familiar with this in the UK, but another thing we are getting familiar with in the UK is the desire of europhobes – and we might hear from one shortly – to opt out of key EU justice and home affairs measures. What a mistake that would be! I look forward to the UK finally taking part in the Schengen Information System.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, not only for all his work on Schengen on this particular dossier but also for his flexibility when the Council proposed having a separate legal instrument to ensure the participation of the UK and Ireland in the policing aspects of the SIS. They cannot, of course, take part in the immigration and border control parts of the system, but I am pleased to say that the UK is keen to be involved in the policing aspects. It would have been great had this measure been ready before the London Olympics as there was some concern that the fact of the UK not yet being hooked up would make it difficult to identify criminals or terrorists. I am glad to say we had a safe London Olympics, but nonetheless it was a pity that the deadline was missed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The UK has been preparing for a number of years to connect to SIS II. It is responsible for 18% of the total charge to the EU budget as well as the domestic costs. The consequences of opting out of SIS II are obvious: the UK would not only lose its considerable investment but would also be unable to make use of a system that has proved a very valuable law-enforcement tool.</p>
      <p sl="de">Without access to SIS II, the UK would not have access to alerts issued by other Member States in order, for example, to locate and apprehend criminals who escape into the UK from one of the other Schengen countries. Neither could the UK issue a SIS alert in order to locate a suspect who had left the UK, or a car stolen in the UK and driven abroad. While the UK authorities could still request assistance from other Member States’ authorities on an ad hoc basis, this would be much slower and more cumbersome than the automated and immediate exchange through SIS II.</p>
      <p sl="de">I cannot understand those British politicians and their hangers-on who want the UK to opt out of this means to keep the British people safe and secure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on his significant work on the reports concerning the transition to SIS II and I wish him further success on the file. As you may know, our Verts/ALE Group is extremely cautious about biometrics in all files and since SIS II introduces the processing of biometric data, we have consistently expressed our awareness of data protection. We are now glad that our concerns on data protection and on the necessity of the final deadline are being fully taken into account. Therefore, our group can support the initiative as we did in September 2008 when we supported migration instruments, and in May 2010 when the current migration instruments were being amended. Nevertheless, we do not think that splitting the proposal into two almost identical documents is the best solution from the point of view of the simplification of legislation, but as it has already been decided we will however support it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do not understand the concern of the Commission regarding the proposal from the European Data Protection Supervisor and then from the rapporteur on the deletion of non-protected data. We do not think this is a problem. We also fully support the rapporteur on maintaining the deadline for transition in the migration instrument at the end of June 2013. We have heard from the Council about the first half of 2013, but if we have this date in the report then we are sure that if once again we have problems with the transition to SIS II then another solution has to be found.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course SIS is an international police database system but also associated with this is an EU police organisation called SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at National Entry). Now this is a little known organisation and it has been described by some of its operatives as top secret. It has executive powers and although Britain is not yet a member of the Schengen Group, the UK is expected to joint SIRENE in 2013. It already has officers working within Member States’ police forces and our German SIRENE officer is attached to the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency and his name is Jan-Per Ruehmann. Under Schengen an alert placed on an SIS database should be treated as a European Arrest Warrant. Therefore within the Schengen area, at least, extradition may now simply be on the basis of the hit on a database. European Arrest Warrants will rise sharply after we join SIS in 2013. If I may conclude: the noble Baroness Ludford referred to a europhobe, possibly myself. I do not hate Europe. I love Europe; I dislike the European Union and what I love most are the ancient liberties of my countrymen which I want to preserve.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the SIS II is a well-worn subject. We have lost count of the delays; perhaps we should remember that the initial decision dates back to 2001. I will say that in a way, I am glad of all these delays. On the other hand, I am not pleased that we have lost count of the increases in loans voted in favour of this white elephant, because we know the Commission to be much more concerned about the correct use of loans on a certain number of dossiers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, I am not glad about the future implementation of generalised information systems. We all know that in all the Member States, there are some slip-ups concerning the protection of our fellow citizens’ data contained in these files. The European Parliament had to fight hard to be informed, and also for the comments of the European Data Protection Supervisor to be at least partly incorporated, but that does not really reassure me. There cannot be security for citizens if this concept is not understood in all accepted meanings of the term and if fundamental freedoms are not truly protected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore still fundamentally opposed to this unequivocal vision of security. We oppose this security-conscious Europe. The block we are witnessing concerning data deletion is unfortunately simply an example of what we do not want.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will vote against this report, not because we oppose the efforts of our rapporteur, whom I take this opportunity to congratulate, but because we oppose this method of generalised filing of citizens, which does not take sufficient account of data protection.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Council representatives, unlike the speaker before me, I am an enthusiastic advocate of the Schengen Information System for several reasons.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we know that, as an investigative facility, the Schengen Information System represents a real success story in the area of security. This has been proven.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it is also a success story in connection with our open internal borders and freedom of travel. After all, it is Schengen that forms the very basis for this. Consequently, the system is a real success story for Europe in two senses.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we now consider the second-generation Schengen Information System, we can see further progress, further development – on the one hand, because biometric data are also now entered into this system and, on the other, because it offers multiple and improved data links – this too is in the interests of security – and because it also offers greater data security. All in all it is a very positive development. Previously it looked as if Schengen II would become a real never-ending story. Now it looks as though we are hopefully reaching a conclusion and the data transfer can begin, with SIS II being fully available in the interests of the security of European citizens by the middle of next year. I hope that the Commission will do everything in its power to ensure that SIS II really will be available, as promised, next summer.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank Mr Coelho, who once again has produced some excellent work in connection with Schengen and who has contributed to Schengen being a security success for the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, let me start with a little historical reminder. When we were planning for the nine new Member States to join the Schengen Area we were told by the Council that this could not take place as originally planned because SIS II had not yet been completed. Back then, they said we would have to wait another few months. That was in early 2007. Thanks to the Portuguese Presidency the accession was finally achieved in December 2007. We are now about five years down the line and we are still waiting for SIS II. There have been many promises. Hopefully this latest promise will be the last. At the time we argued that Schengen was not a technical issue but a political issue. It is based on trust between Member States and reinforces that trust. It is one of the most important parts of the single market. Rolling out SIS II represents progress in areas where there is a real need for it. It enhances the security of the area, improves data protection, asserts fundamental rights and helps the EU to make decisions in this domain. We sincerely hope that it will also finally help to complete the very long Schengen accession process for Romania and Bulgaria. It was the commitment of the Portuguese Presidency that helped the last round of countries joining the Schengen area. Now once more we are in need of a committed stance from the Commission and firm support from the Council.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the effectiveness of the first legislative package of 2001, under which the Commission will prepare the migration of the current Schengen Information System to a more modern, faster and more efficient system, was due to expire on 31 December 2006.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The gradual and repeated delays of the launch of the immediate introduction of SIS II shows the complexity of a safe and smooth transition between generationally markedly different systems. During the very long period spent addressing the technical aspects of the migration between the old and the new system, a fundamental change in the legal framework occurred in the EU, and it seems that this brought about the necessity to modify Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 by integrating the relevant provisions of Article 92 of the Schengen Convention. Those Member States which wish to have full use of the new SIS II technology have the right to insist upon any relevant legislative changes that will allow them to legally switch from the old system to the new.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore believe, Commissioner, that it is very important to take all necessary steps in order to harmonise the legislative framework as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the technical stipulations set out in the report conceal an even more stifling restriction of democratic rights by the European Union: complete scrutiny and monitoring, and more efficient placing of personal data in databases, in particular data on workers’ social action.</p>
      <p sl="el">For many years now, as we know, the European Union has been creating an unprecedented network of mechanisms of repression, monitoring and persecution, such as the Euro-Police, Eurojust, Frontex, anti-terrorist legislation, harmonisation of criminal law, a system for monitoring the external borders, and the strengthening of police and judicial cooperation. The repressive mechanisms of all kinds require more technically advanced databases and methods of collecting and exchanging information. This greater capacity to make use of databases now serves the new second-generation Schengen information system. SIS ΙΙ even overrules the fine words about protection of personal data, because it gives the right to record personal data, including biometric data, and to apply discriminatory surveillance to any person who, in the arbitrary judgment of the repressive mechanisms, is considered guilty of punishable acts.</p>
      <p sl="el">The amendments to the European Parliament report, regarding data accuracy and so-called supervision by the European Data Protection Supervisor and national supervisory authorities, are intended to conceal an orgy – no less – of using databases at EU and national level. The European Union’s much-vaunted area of freedom and security conceals the nightmare reality of an area where basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are suppressed, an area that gives free rein to the repressive mechanisms to protect the power of the monopolies against the people’s resistance and against the struggles of the popular movement.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, please allow me, in turn, to thank our rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent work on Schengen and, of course, to thank him for his flexibility on this particular issue regarding the new second-generation information system. For more than 11 years in Europe we have been discussing – because that is really how long this discussion has taken – the question of when we will manage to complete SIS II, and we are here today in this Chamber to talk once again about some possible delays. You know, in my country, Greece, we have a legend that became a folk song, about the Bridge of Arta, which kept falling down. ‘All day they were building it, and at night it tumbled down,’ goes the song. This is reminiscent of implementing the information system. Every time this issue comes before our committee or the Plenary, we are sure we have ‘fixed it’ and that this time will be the last, and then here we are again to discuss it once more.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course there are security issues which we must solve. Of course there is the question of the registration, management and protection of personal data, which we must certainly safeguard. These are very serious issues but, from a technical point of view, the new technologies can now give us immediate solutions. To solve the problem, the bridge was finally made to stand firm at the expense of sacrificing the head builder’s wife. I hope in our case we will not need to make any sacrifice at the European Union’s expense, other than the time that has already been wasted and the additional expense that has ended up being required.</p>
      <p sl="el">SIS II is a system which we all need for our security. SIS II is a system which must be implemented immediately. We have the technicians and we therefore have the ability to create this bridge for the further development of Schengen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me congratulate Mr Coelho on a fantastic report but there are real concerns about the lack of transparency in the decision-making process. If you shut out Parliament then potentially you lose our support and mistrust will only grow. Also, we need to explain to our citizens the double standards that Romanians and Bulgarians will face when they approach the Schengen border controls.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to say to my own government, the UK Government, that it is extremely important that they remain involved in the negotiations. The UK is not a member of Schengen, but it is part of SIS for use for law enforcement purposes, and therefore it is crucial for the UK Government to support the swift migration from SIS I to SIS II. It is to the advantage of all our citizens in the EU and that includes citizens of the United Kingdom. I do not support, as the coalition government does and particularly the Conservative party, opt-outs from JHA, including potential opt-outs from Schengen. It will be hugely disadvantageous to the citizens of the United Kingdom and not in our national interest. Therefore, I urge all of those concerned to bring a swift resolution to this situation which has gone on for far too long.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, SIS is the most important database for ensuring public security and assisting police and judicial cooperation. Today we hear that it is still riddled with problems. There are problems with Finland, but there is another paradoxical situation of no less significance. Two years ago Bulgaria and Romania became part of SIS 1. Tests were carried out with positive results for moving onto SIS II. At the same time, the two countries still remain outside the Schengen area. Ladies and gentlemen, please remember that Bulgaria is an external border of the European Union. Remaining outside the Schengen area automatically limits the Bulgarian authorities in their processing of data of persons from third countries, and there is pressure particularly from our southern neighbours. This makes the work of SIS II ineffective in terms of European security. Once again, I urge the European Commission and the Council to exercise their power and admit Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area. I trust that a positive solution for both countries will be found before the final implementation of SIS II in 2013. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, in particular for his consistent stance on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank Members for all their comments. I assure you that I have taken good note of the concerns expressed in the debate, and I can tell you that the Commission shares many of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the delay, we are very, very close to completion of the SIS II project. The Central System amply proved its robustness to the satisfaction of the vast majority of the Member States, and the project has now reached the point of no return.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective of bringing the system into operation as soon as possible remains, therefore, an imperative which must not be compromised. Experience shows that this is only possible through overall constructive cooperation and solidarity promoted by all the stakeholders. The Commission is further ready to provide any possible support needed to overcome all the remaining challenges. The added value that SIS II will bring to our common area of freedom and security merits our utmost engagement to ensure the final delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of your comments and worries have centred on the fact that we witnessed a delay in the readiness of Finland, and Baroness Ludford asked why the problem had not been detected earlier. Here I would like to emphasise that the monitoring system for national development, namely the SIS II Task Force, was put in place by the Council some time ago but it obviously failed to detect the technical issues arising in Finland. As you know, the Member States bear full responsibility for the system at their level, and given that Finland did not volunteer for an earlier testing campaign, the national issues there were revealed only in the last round of tests, which were mandatory for all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, I believe this is still an issue which we can solve together because now we have cooperation with Finland, and the Commission and the other Member States are making efforts to assist as much as possible. I believe that, with all the other Member States, the migration will start as planned in January, and Finland will join these efforts once it is ready.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the complete switchover, we have to wait until the whole system is ready, but I believe that we are really very close to that point and we will do our utmost to have a clear answer for you after thorough examination of the issue and the discussion among the Interior Ministers on 5 and 6 December at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to Ms Vergiat’s concerns about data protection, it has to be emphasised that SIS II is a very important and robust EU instrument. It increases the functionality, capacity and performance of the system and it also improves governance and accountability, through greater safeguards on data protection. So I believe that, once the system is in place and operational, we will all benefit from the high quality of reliable services and the new information which we will be able to obtain, and I think it will further improve the way we actually use the freedoms we have as citizens, including freedom of travel.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I would like to begin with the question of applying the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Romania and Bulgaria. The Presidency remains fully committed to the successful enlargement of the Schengen area and continues to work towards this goal. The issue was on the agenda of the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 25 October, when the Presidency gave Member States a progress report on the efforts towards full implementation of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania. After negotiation with all the parties concerned, the Presidency announced that unfortunately the unanimous vote necessary for taking the relevant Council decision could not be achieved at that stage. The Presidency also provided all the representations with an overview of implementation of the predetermined measures aimed at contributing to the successful enlargement of the Schengen area. The Presidency hopes that on this basis, the enlargement of the Schengen area can be achieved in the near future. As regards the delay in the schedule for implementing the work, there are speculations, on the basis of certain signs, that the national system of one Member State will not be ready in good time before the end of March. Of course, this has not yet been confirmed, and it would thus be premature to make any statement on the exact conclusions which can be drawn from the attempt to overcome these problems. As I have said, the Commission will update the Council on this in December, and I hope we will then have a better and clearer picture of the situation. Similar problems and delays have arisen in the past. Fortunately, we are at the stage of final completion of the work. My own assessment is that any delay occurring as a result of the latest developments will be very brief. Mr President, the Presidency wishes to express, once again, its gratitude for the efforts made by the European Parliament to achieve rapid adoption of the reports which will be taken into account by the Council in the final settlement of the issue. As regards any concerns about the progress in the completion of SIS II, the Presidency will continue to monitor developments closely and will be in close contact with all the parties involved, in an effort to minimise any problems which may adversely affect the prompt completion of the work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The switchover to the second generation Schengen Information System will help to increase security at external borders. The SIS is considered to be the backbone of the area of freedom, security and justice. SIS II will make it possible to add biometric data and new functions which can increase security within the Union and can lead to more intelligent use of the information transmitted within the system.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Romania has adopted all of the technical measures for the implementation of the Schengen Information System, and is ready to be connected to the system. The evaluation missions conducted in my country have certified this fact. In addition, Romania has met all of the criteria for accession to the Schengen Area and has completed their technical implementation. This fact was acknowledged by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in June 2011 and by the resolution adopted by the European Parliament in October 2011, but the adoption of a decision has been blocked in Council, and the reasons for the blockage are not connected with Romania’s preparations to enter the Schengen Area. I believe that such an attitude is not constructive and does not encourage cooperation within the Union. For that reason, I once again appeal for the situation to be resolved and for a decision to admit Romania to the Schengen Area to be adopted.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Giles Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the activities of the Committee on Petitions 2011 (2011/2317(INI)) (A7-0240/2012).</p>
    </intervention>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, it is my pleasure to present this report to the House, giving details of the work of the Committee on Petitions in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that year, 998 petitions were declared admissible and 416 further petitions were received but declared inadmissible. I would like to recommend to colleagues a glance at the statistical analysis in the explanatory statement because that gives some interesting information about the origin of petitions and the subjects with which they are most concerned, as well as the countries the petitioners come from.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three topics of most importance: fundamental rights, the internal market and the environment. Interestingly, the country from which most complaints come is Germany. The citizens of Germany raise the largest number of petitions, closely followed by Spain and Italy, whereas the countries most frequently the subject of petitions are Spain and Germany – same countries, different order. I find that particularly interesting, bearing in mind my mailbag from constituents with concerns about Europe, because my Member State, the United Kingdom, comes about sixth or seventh on the list of petitioning countries, yet, from the perception of the way people in the UK view the EU, you would expect a higher proportion. I find that interesting.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to pick out some of the topics that we refer to in the report. The first is the right of European citizens and residents to their legitimately acquired property, with concerns over what can happen to that property in another country. In 2011 there were 70 petitions relating to the Spanish Ley de Costas [Coastal Law]. Fifty-one of those were identified as coming from Spanish citizens, so it is not a question of foreigners concerned about their holiday homes: here we have Spanish citizens concerned about their property rights. That is quite a recurring theme.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to note the increasing number of petitions relating to, or raising, issues that are not within the competence of the European Union. Maybe we should take it as a compliment that people wish to raise issues and look to us for solutions and reparations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to welcome Parliament’s decision to develop a much more practical and visible petitions portal on its website, which should facilitate citizens’ access to the petitions process. I welcome – we welcome – the constructive cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the services of the European Ombudsman, and we reaffirm our determination to support the Ombudsman in identifying maladministration, both on the part of EU institutions and affecting them.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consider the correct implementation of the Waste Framework Directive in all Member States to be of the utmost importance, and we ask Member States to deal with waste-management trouble spots decisively and swiftly. We support wholeheartedly the underlying objective of the Ley de Costas , namely that the environment of the Spanish coast should be protected from overdevelopment; and that issue continues to be a problem for Spanish petitioners.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, for his work in drafting this valuable report as well as Ms Mazzoni and the whole Petitions Committee, whose impressive work is reflected in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report points to some of the most topical and sensitive areas subject to the citizens’ petition in the field of environment and fundamental rights, on which the Commission and Parliament are already working closely and will continue to exchange information and views.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s debate marks a good opportunity to underline my appreciation of Parliament’s remarkable commitment to the smooth implementation of Article 227 of the Treaty, which reserves the right of any EU citizen resident in the Member State or any company, organisation, association with its headquarters in the EU to submit a petition to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is particularly happy to be able to contribute to Parliament’s important work. This is a considerable investment in terms of resources. And it is worth it, since handling the citizen’s petitions is ultimately also a means for the EU institutions of winning citizens’ trust in these difficult times. In this regard, the European Parliament and the Commission clearly share the commitment to put citizens first. Citizens are and must always remain at the centre of all our activities and discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As rightly mentioned in the Lichtenberger report, which is the next point on this plenary session’s agenda, the Committee on Petitions plays a central role as an effective link between citizens, the Parliament and the Commission. This is why the Commission always includes a section on petitions in its annual report on the application of the EU law, in which we recognise that petitions to the European Parliament lead to infringement proceedings in a number of areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the next annual report on the application of EU law, which will be adopted in the coming weeks, we also plan to indicate the concrete number of cases which had their origin in petitions. With this in mind, please let me reiterate our willing and continued collaboration with your work on Parliament’s Committee on Petitions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Mr Chichester’s report points out, you asked us for help with over half of the almost 1000 admissible petitions which you received in 2011. Although our help initially consists mainly in analysing what EU law, if any, might be applicable in the case, we also attend the follow-up meetings of your petitions. It is important that my fellow members of the Commission continue to attend key meetings for exchanges of views with your committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to say a few words on the European Citizens’ Initiative, a system in which the Petitions Committee has a relevant role. Since 1 April 2012 a new tool of participatory democracy has been in place at EU level with the entry into application of the European Citizens’ Initiative. The initial technical problems encountered are being solved.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has put its own servers at the disposal of organisers and provided extended help, guidance and assistance to them for the certification process. Three initiatives are now up and running, collecting signatures on-line even as we speak.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to assure you that I am committed to making sure that citizens can make full use of their new rights, and I look forward to our cooperation in that regard. I would like to conclude by stressing that the Commission looks forward to continuing and enhancing its fruitful cooperation with Parliament’s Petitions Committee.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, as you know, the Committee on Petitions does not feature on the plenary agenda very often. However, the work that this Committee does is extremely important. It receives citizens’ grievances and defends the rights of European citizens. This is the reason why the committee conducts a large number of hearings each year. This is also the reason why we maintain a close dialogue with the European Commission, the Member States and other bodies and institutions such as the European Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, almost half of the petitions lodged continue to be inadmissible because they concern subjects that lie outside the Union’s remit, and for that reason I believe it is a very good idea to give citizens more information about the Union in general, and Parliament in particular, from now on. I also believe that the involvement of the Committee on Petitions in hearings on European Citizens’ Initiatives, which Commissioner Šefčovič also spoke about, can make a positive contribution to this information process.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also like to say that aside from the countries which Mr Chichester mentioned last year – Germany, Spain and Italy – as being top in terms of the numbers of petitions lodged, Poland and Romania are next, which shows us that citizens in both the old and the new Member States are involved in the protection of their rights at European level. The main topics of petitions are: environmental protection, the internal market and fundamental rights, and this is no coincidence, because they are fundamental areas for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I shall end my brief speech by saying that I support efficient and appropriate use of this instrument, which serves as a means of commencing direct dialogue between Parliament and citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on his excellent report and the excellent cooperation between us during its drafting and the discussions in committee.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As in previous years, the Committee on Petitions has received a very large number of petitions with regard to breaches of European environmental legislation. Once again, I would like to ask the Member States to pay particular attention to these matters. What is at stake here is both the quality of day-to-day life for European citizens and the preservation of the unique natural heritage of our Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this regard, I welcome Commissioner Potočnik’s initiative of making an amendment to the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and would like to underline the contribution that the Committee on Petitions has made in this development. I request that this change should have regard, first and foremost, to clear and transparent criteria and should guarantee the neutrality and objectiveness of impact assessments, in view of the fact that the latter are the major weaknesses of the current Directive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Our committee has been and is a place where European citizens express their concerns about failures to respect European rights. The single amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is aimed in this direction. On behalf of European citizens and on my own behalf, today I ask all Member States and the European Commission to respect freedom of movement for all European citizens, regardless of nationality, race and sexual orientation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that the Committee on Petitions is one of the most important committees in Parliament because it does provide a real tangible link between the European institutions and citizens. Mr Chichester was telling us about the explanatory statement. I have a few figures from that and it tells us that since 1997 over 20 000 petitions have been dealt with, and in the last three years alone 323 main petitioners actually addressed the committee in person, so that is a genuine link to citizens. However, the reason they are there in the first place of course is that they have concerns about the transposition or application of European legislation, so it is our duty to respond in a real and meaningful way.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the most significant areas is the area of the environment, which represents 20 % of the total of infringement cases, and the environmental impact assessment directive is a case in point. Indeed, my own Member State is before the courts, having failed to properly transpose that piece of legislation. I have personally come across a number of cases and situations that were adversely affected by this, including one in my own constituency in Donegal, in a place called Carnagarve where a sewage system was being constructed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another issue that has been highlighted is the obstacles faced by persons with disabilities to free movement and it is not just the physical obstacles but the inability to travel without a personal assistant. Most of us hop on a plane, a boat or a train and off we go, but for people with disabilities who can only travel with the help of a personal assistant, I am afraid the phrase ‘free movement of persons’ is a hollow promise from the EU because many Member States do not provide that service.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, one thing I can say in light of my experiences on the Petitions Committee is that we need to be honest with citizens; we should not over-promise; we need to be clear about the possibilities and avenues for redress and above all we should not use the Petitions Committee to simply pass the buck.</p>

    <intervention id="2-688-000" speaker_id="28161" name="Margrete Auken" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would also like to add my thanks to Mr Chichester for a good report. I will not repeat what has been said by my fellow Members; however, by way of summary I will simply say that we must do much more to ensure that this committee, which is so close to the citizen, also becomes known within the Union so that people make use of it. I am grateful too that attention has been drawn to it.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, I would like to pick up on one thing in particular that I know Mr Chichester has also been concerned about, namely the Coastal Law in Spain. In paragraph 18 of the report, you state that we welcome the Spanish collaboration. You surely cannot mean this! If you had seen what is now contained in the draft law that is being driven through the Spanish parliament with an absolute majority, you would say ‘No, we will not do this!’ and then you would – as I hope you will do tomorrow – support our amendment 5. That is the most important thing. However, there is also amendment 6, in which we expressly point out that the Coastal Law, as it is currently being considered, goes against the spirit of Parliament’s 2009 report. It contains no mention of safeguarding coastal protection or the natural environment. Nor does it give individual property owners and landowners better rights. In fact, the only people being given better rights, because they are gaining legality, are big businesses. It is also the case that all of the countless infringements of the Coastal Law that have taken place in the past are now being legalised, and what we both agree on is that this has been a terrible attack on ordinary citizens. Please allow me to say, then, that I hope – and I would like to focus specifically on this, even though it is unjustified given all the good things in your report which we also support – I very much hope that we can gather together tomorrow to send a signal to Spain. There is much evidence to suggest that our working group will not finish its task … will not be allowed to complete its tasks before Spain has adopted the law. Therefore, we have an opportunity tomorrow to make Spain aware of our views. We must say: ‘Not in the name of Parliament!’ Not in my name either! In reality, they are using the Auken report to legitimise the draft law that is now being put forward. Therefore, I truly hope that you will join us tomorrow in sending a clear signal to Spain, so that it will know that it at least cannot exploit Parliament and Parliament’s 2009 report – that is, the Auken report – because that is what is happening.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Chair of the Committee on Petitions, ladies and gentlemen, right now in the House we have an assembly of the Visegrád Group, as the President is from the Czech Republic, the Commissioner is from Slovakia and I am from Poland. To go back to the main topic of our meeting, though, I would like to stress the importance of the Committee on Petitions. It is often the last resort for desperate citizens, taxpayers and voters in our Member States. These people often have the feeling that the European Parliament is sometimes no more than the Committee on Petitions, as it is the address for so many complaints, woes and problems of ordinary people, who are left cold by major-league politics, but who are interested in specific problems. My fellow Members who have spoken before me in this House have already said wise things about those problems. I would like to say that the Committee on Petitions does also get involved in what we might call megapolitical problems; I might remind you that during the last term of Parliament the Committee on Petitions showed the entire European Parliament the way as far as the Nord Stream gas pipeline was concerned. Following the issue of the decision of the Committee on Petitions on this matter, the European Parliament took a sceptical decision. Unfortunately Member State governments, or some of them at any rate, saw things differently, but the Committee on Petitions behaved with unprecedented decency in this matter, and in line with the intentions of the citizens of Member States who had contacted them. I would also remind you, although there may be some in this House who will not like to be reminded, of the case of Spain, which we are discussing here – and rightly so – or of another famous case: Cadena Cope, a Catalan radio station, which was refused a concession, and which, thanks to the debates and the pressure brought about by the Committee on Petitions, won its battle with the President of the European Parliament Josep Borrell, with the result that this concession was awarded to that station. I am talking now about specific cases in which the Committee on Petitions was very influential and effective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There have been other very minor matters, though. I can speak specifically about my own country, Poland, where citizens have complained to the Committee on Petitions about the importation of vehicles from abroad, when they have had to pay duty twice. The Committee on Petitions got involved in that matter too.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These are extremely important, albeit trivial, but specific matters, which help to build the authority of the European Parliament. This is extremely important, and the Committee on Petitions is due a vote of thanks for what they do.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Mr Chichester has earned congratulations for his excellent report, and I would like to add my own.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, the work of the Committee on Petitions is extremely important for the protection of EU citizens’ rights and democratic institutions in the European area.</p>
      <p sl="el">The fact that the number of new petitions submitted to the Committee increased in 2011 is seen as a positive development. The Committee has dealt with a great variety of petitions. Free movement of persons, the internal market, the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens and environmental issues were the key areas at the heart of the Committee’s work. As noted in the report, there has been a rise in the number of petitions on economic and financial matters in the wake of the current debt crisis. The content of the petitions reaching the Committee reflects the concerns and issues that affect and engage European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="el">With this in mind, we can see the importance of the call to improve the Committee’s web portal on the European Parliament website, in order to strengthen the effectiveness and transparency of the petition process and provide better information to European citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="2-691-000" speaker_id="96772" name="Peter Jahr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you to our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, for his excellent report, which acknowledges the successes of the committee, but also focuses attention on certain things, namely our Committee on Petitions, which is very important, and also mentions things which can undoubtedly be improved. I am very pleased that the committee has been successful in continuing its excellent work from previous years. We offer European citizens an important point of contact in the event that they feel they have been treated unfairly. If you go through and look at the report you can see that no topic was unimportant to us. We really do cover a wide range of subjects. As MEPs we also have the courage to deal with difficult and sensitive issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">You could say that the Committee on Petitions ensures direct contact between citizens on the one hand and the European Union and European Parliament on the other. When we conduct fact-finding missions and have initiatives held locally, many people come into contact with the European Parliament for the first time through the Committee on Petitions. For that reason alone, the continued existence of our committee is worthwhile.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now to the question that must always be asked. Every service can be improved, so what, from my perspective, can still be improved here? Firstly, we must make sure that processing times are reduced. This is partly due to the internal processes we employ in the committee, but also, above all, to the length of time it takes to get a corresponding answer from the Commission. I know the Commission sometimes also has to wait too long for the preliminary work from the Member States – this should also proceed more quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we should reduce the number of inadmissible petitions. Thirdly, it is also possible to improve our collaboration with the responsible expert committees. I would like to put it like this: the comments that we get from citizens and pass on to the expert committees are not intended to hinder their work, but to enhance it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, congratulations to Mr Chichester on this excellent report. Of course, one of the most important functions of our committee is that we are the direct interface between citizens and the institutions – and in some cases the Member States – on European issues. Often we can do no more than encourage Member States to do the right thing, and we have certainly been trying to do that in relation to Spanish property petitions but it is worthwhile recalling that since 2004 not one Spanish property petition has been successfully concluded.</p>
      <p sl="en">Too many citizens are still the victims of expropriation and suffer the destruction of their houses on the basis of misapplied laws, whether the Ley de Costas or urbanisation laws. I welcome the setting-up of the working group to discuss these issues in relation to Spanish property law, and I hope it will be not just a talking shop but rather a constructive body making specific and effective proposals to address the very important issue of fair compensation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding freedom of movement and fundamental rights, the S&amp;D Group has tabled an amendment which reflects, I believe, the core value of this House in that regard, namely the principle of equality. Same-sex families, the Roma and other minority groups suffer particularly from restrictions on their freedom of movement inside the EU, as we have heard on many occasions. We need to remind the Member States of the obligation under Directive 2004/38 to facilitate entry and residence without discrimination – and that applies to all.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Chichester on a fine report, and above all I would like to acknowledge the great and very important work done by the Committee on Petitions – work that is a little overshadowed by the work of the other committees, those that are busy with draft legal enactments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Committee on Petitions, though, plays an exceptionally important role – and this is the role of being in contact with citizens of the European Union, and conducting a dialogue with them. It is on this committee in particular that one may find out how European legislation is working in its application to specific people. This is a very important process, this checking on how the law that we make here in this House is working in practice. The complaint may be voiced that the Committee on Petitions is obviously not in a position to come up to every expectation. Ever so many people submit petitions, but there is only the one committee, and clearly what it does, important as it is, is not able to meet those needs. We should consider whether in the future, perhaps by having petitions examined in some kind of scope, whether petitions might not be also dealt with by committees for specific areas, to enable these petitions to be more thoroughly diagnosed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report is very good, although perhaps it is just a little light as regards information such as the kind of efficacy these petitions have, what has been achieved by way of change as a result of petitions, and what citizens have achieved by sending a petition to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to draw attention to the need for a reaction to petitions which have been deemed inadmissible. Obviously there is limited potential to consider petitions, and strictly they may address matters that arise out of European law, but the thing is to see that those citizens who have submitted petitions – petitions that cannot be examined in Parliament – also get some kind of satisfaction. It looks as if passing on such petitions, for example, to the relevant national authorities, with some sort of sign that an interest is being taken on what their subsequent fate is, would also be desirable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Among the topics that I would like the committee to address in future I would point to the problem of harmonised taxes, and VAT. In my country, Poland, many complaints are addressed to the national authorities, which, in the opinion of the complainants – and in my view the complainants have a point here – are not fully complying with the principles of European law, and it is worth the committee taking a look at these tax questions in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to go into details of the issues raised and the critical areas that have emerged, since these have been fully analysed, in primis , by the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, whom I thank for the work carried out, and by my colleagues in their interventions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Taking stock after a year’s work, I think I can say that the net result is positive. The slight fluctuations in the number of petitions submitted, the ratio between admissible and inadmissible petitions, the total petitions successfully closed, surely demonstrate a gradual improvement in the organisation of the committee's work and the more efficient tools available to it. The data contained in the report indicate that the initiatives undertaken to improve public information and, more importantly, to make access to this easier, are important initiatives and should be given priority by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">The increase in own-initiative reports, referrals to other committees for opinion and reports in this chamber signal an appreciation of the value of the complaints made by citizens, and how useful these are in monitoring the stage of implementation of European legislation and its effectiveness. What I find significant, however, is the allocation to the Committee on Petitions of the role of associate committee in the citizens’ initiative procedure, as defined by Regulation (EU) No 211/2011. This was announced by Commissioner Šefčovič, whom I thank again for his commitment to this issue. This makes the administrative law-making process linked to citizens’ initiatives more democratic and more participatory.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I would say that the Committee on Petitions proved itself to be a vital tool in 2011 in helping to build a people’s Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, thank you. The Committee on Petitions plays a very important part in the process of monitoring EU law, and complaints submitted by European citizens make it possible for the European Parliament to give attention to every instance of it being broken. The problem of failure by Member States to observe the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is one of those that crops up most commonly in our debates. In this context, the latest ruling by the Court of Justice, relating to Article 51, is of exceptional importance, emphasising as it does that the basic rights of an individual in the EU are currently protected and guaranteed by Treaty provisions. This means that they are subject to absolute observance by the authorities in Member States. It would be a good step to create a single service for citizens wishing to lodge an appeal or lawsuit or obtain information, making use of the ‘Your Rights in the European Union’ portal. This initiative, in conjunction with a new petition portal, will pay off by bringing the procedures of the European Parliament and the Commission even closer to EU citizens, and by potentially increasing the number of petitioners. In congratulating the rapporteurs, I would at the same time like to emphasise the ongoing need to monitor implementation of European legislation in the European Union, and especially in the field of environmental legislation, justice and the internal market, since the overwhelming majority of petitions received in 2011 related to these very areas. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Chichester on his excellent work, and congratulate Marian Harkin, who is a member of this committee and who provides me, and many other people, with a great deal of assistance.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Mr President, it is interesting that in 2011 just two short of a thousand petitions were admissible. That is a lot of petitions and an awful lot of work and I think that we should acknowledge that and compliment those involved in dealing with these issues because they take a lot of time.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I had the privilege of making one of those petitions on behalf of my constituents in Haulbowline in Cork Harbour under the Waste Framework Directive. For six years they had gotten nowhere with their complaints. There was a toxic site, nobody listened to them, the responsibility was passed from Jack to Billy and Billy to Jack and as a result nothing happened. Yet in that area because of the presence of chromium VI and because the site was toxic it had a 37 % higher cancer rate than the rest of the country.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Thankfully, the Petitions Committee met, made a decision and as result of that the Government was given three months to clean up the site, for which EUR 40 million had been donated and the site has now been cleaned up – a perfect example of the way the Petitions Committee works. I would like to see that expanded and also made more available to citizens so that they can see the benefits of the Petitions Committee.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Petitions is the conscience of the European Parliament, and in many respects of the European Union. For many European citizens it is their last resort for legal protection. This is why it is very important for the work to be carried out properly and I fully agree with Mr Chichester’s report; the Committee on Petitions carries out excellent professional and political work and it is important to increase the harmony and coordination between the European Commission and the Committee on Petitions. This is even more vital today because in recent years the number of petitions relating to violations of fundamental democratic rights has increased. Unfortunately, many petitions have been submitted recently from my country, Hungary, to the Commission because the Hungarian Government discontinued early retirement and disability service pensions with retroactive effect along with the support given to those receiving regular social allowances and to those in law and order. I trust that the Committee on Petitions will be able to provide those who have had their fundamental human rights violated with substantial assistance in these matters.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in 2011 our work in the Committee on Petitions was concentrated in two main areas: protection of the environment and protection of fundamental rights. This year, as in previous years, the number of individuals submitting petitions rose to 1 414. Sadly, as many as 416 of these were deemed inadmissible. Because of this, efforts must be redoubled to make citizens aware of the scope of the legal framework within which our committee functions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I view with satisfaction Parliament’s decision to involve the Committee on Petitions in every hearing on a successfully conducted European Citizens’ Initiative. This partnering of the committee responsible, which is objectively competent in the case in question, confirms the status of the Committee on Petitions as the agency that has the greatest experience in relations with people living in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">To sum up, I would like to emphasise the importance of the decision to introduce technical solutions to give citizens easier access to the submission of petitions, including the development of a more transparent and practical portal on its website, and also the creation of a ‘single service’ for citizens looking for information or wanting to lodge an appeal.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations on an excellent report. The increase in the number of petitions is an important sign. Having respect for our common values still leaves a lot to be desired in the European Union. An increasing number of European citizens are aware of their rights and want to assert them, and they know that they can submit a petition to the Commission and to the European Parliament if their fundamental rights have been breached and they have been discriminated against. The increase in the number of petitions in a given area clearly shows the rise in the number of national restrictions and breaches of law. In 2011, for example, the number of petitions regarding the press and freedom of expression rose to 131, from 26 in the previous year. We aim not only to respond to complaints but also to create genuine solutions to the issues raised in the petitions, working together with the Committee on Petitions and the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Committee on Petitions this year acquired the right to be automatically included in hearings on European Citizens’ Initiatives. In my view, it is the main theme of 2011 for this committee. Citizens know which committee to go to if their rights are not respected, but now it also applies if they have suggestions for improving European legislation. I would like the Committee on Petitions to be considered increasingly as the preferred interlocutor of citizens in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This problem of consideration is also found in the results of position-taking of the Committee on Petitions. Too often, we are contacted by citizens who are facing legal imbroglios on which we would like to take a position. However, when the problems are European, the solutions should be European; we remain powerless, as subsidiarity does not always go with European solutions, and this is because of lack of national will.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will take the difficult example of trans-national divorces: the problems are both national and European when custody or visiting rights go beyond national borders, in the case in question German borders. In spite of the obvious difficulties that many parents have in seeing their children born of a bi-national union, in Parliament we are still powerless to act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My suggestion that all European citizens have the right to a national ombudsman – especially for those petitions originating from Germany, which sends a vast number – modelled on the defender of rights in France, has not been followed up. Nevertheless, in the case of trans-national divorces, this remains a way of reconciling a European problem by means of a national solution. In many cases, European law appears to be powerless to meet citizens’ expectations. The European year of the … 2013 should deal with citizen’s grievances, the … of divorce but we need means to act to be …</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, as a Vice-Chair of the Committee on Petitions, I have reached the conclusion that lodging petitions can be the best way of starting a public debate about problems faced by ordinary citizens in terms of injustices committed by authorities. In 2011 the majority of the petitions lodged concerned fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One thing I do not agree with, and which I hope will be remedied in future, is the fact that too many petitions concern political matters which, in any case, lie within national and not EU jurisdiction and should not have been declared admissible in the first place. Some examples would be subjects such as freedom of the press, cyanide mining at Roşia Montană, stray dogs and, more recently, shale gas mining. I hope that in future the admissibility of such petitions will be analysed in a more well-founded way and that better judgment will be exercised when political items on the agenda of a Member State are referred to the Committee on Petitions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Just as an attempt was made to politicise the visit of the Committee on Petitions to Romania, the same also happens with the majority of fact-finding visits made to other Member States. As members of Parliament, each of us belongs to a political party, but we should use this committee only for the benefit of citizens and not to serve party interests or attack or defend the government in power in a Member State.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I would like to thank Mr Chichester, the Committee on Petitions and Mrs Mazzoni once again for their excellent work and cooperation with the Commission. We will of course try to work together on the deepening of this cooperation and also on how we could express it even more explicitly. Therefore we would like to include next year – especially in the report on the application of European law as mentioned in my introductory remarks – the very valuable input we received from the Committee on Petitions, indicating citizens’ complaints concerning the applicability, application and respect for European law.</p>
      <p sl="en">From this debate, I would also like highlight how much we appreciate the European Parliament’s plan to upgrade the website, with a focus on the Commission’s reply. I believe this would complete the picture, showing what happened with a petition and how the committee dealt with it as well as the input and response from the Commission. So this is an excellent initiative and of course we very much look forward to cooperating with you on these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because of the time restrictions I can only respond to two issues, which were probably those mentioned most often. The first one relates to the environmental petitions and to the speech made by Mr Boştinaru concerning the revision of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. It is true that the proposal was adopted on 26 October 2012. We would like to make the process through this new proposal shorter, with clear timelines, but also much stronger with regard to the quality of air reports through the use of accredited experts and mandatory assessment of the reasonable alternatives. I believe that this would also give a bit of clarity to the process and strong assurances to citizens that all the environmental impacts are assessed properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Spanish coastal law, which was raised by Mrs Auken and Mr Cashman, I would just like to inform you that the Commission has raised the issue with the Spanish authorities on several occasions in recent years because we have been aware that the number of complaints is actually very high, not only from Spanish but also from EU citizens. We are still keeping a very close eye on this issue, especially on the new draft law which was proposed. We are in contact with the Spanish authorities and of course the Commission will follow the process leading to the adoption of the law very carefully and will look at the final text to see whether it affects EU law or not.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It is clear and there is no doubt that the growing role of the Committee on Petitions in the European Parliament reflects and proves that European citizens take dialogue with European institutions along with direct participation very seriously. Both the topics summarised in the report as well as the number of topics leave no doubt that we need to rethink as well as attribute a greater role and more powers to the Committee on Petitions, as set forth in the report. The reason and the significance of this can be attributed not only to what I have just mentioned but also to two other completely separate factors. On the one hand, it is justified by the More Europe initiative as it is inconceivable to have political and structural representation where the intermediary role between the citizens represented and the Members of Parliament is played by a weak committee with no powers. On the other hand, the growing euroscepticism we see in some Member States is precisely the result of efficient and unsuccessful dialogue. In conclusion: I agree with both the content of the report and the indicated and expected objectives, and lend it my full support. Let this be a genuine point of contact with a clear and independent role.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Eva Lichtenberger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the 28th annual report on monitoring the application of EU law (2010) (COM(2011)0588 – 2011/2275(INI)), (A7-0330/2012).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the transposition of Community law is something that should clearly be of great interest to each and every MEP. Why? Following a well-honed procedure, which now usually involves only one reading in Parliament but extensive deliberations in the committees, takes a wide range of viewpoints into account, and involves contact with the Council, negotiations with the Council, and compromises and decisions in the European Parliament, we make rules that apply, or should apply, to the entire European Union. It is this ‘should’ that I will now discuss.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we see the effort that goes into making these laws, these European regulations, and then have to observe how, in some Member States, this EU law is transposed, applied and monitored carelessly or not at all, this should give us plenty of food for thought. Unfortunately, over the last few years in particular, the European Union’s Member States have not necessarily become more inclined to emphasise the similarities in Europe more than the differences and to observe the common rules of play.</p>
      <p sl="de">I could list a wide range of examples for you. What is important in this process is that we point out where legislation has not been transposed, where it has been transposed incorrectly or inadequately or where it is not being monitored. Individual citizens play an important role here by contacting the Commission with a complaint, to draw its attention to the fact that something is going wrong in a certain Member State. We come here to a critical point, which the Committee on Legal Affairs and my report criticise sharply.</p>
      <p sl="de">A number of years ago, the Commission introduced ‘EU Pilot’, a pilot project that essentially aims to bring the fewest possible infringement proceedings against Member States. Instead, an attempt is made in an informal way to reach an agreement with the Member State. So far there is nothing here to object to. However, when the complainant does not hear anything from the Commission other than ‘I have received your complaint’ and then hears nothing more for ages, and when he himself does not have access to what is known about the progress of the non-transposition process he has instituted, something is rotten in the State of Denmark. This is no way to proceed.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are therefore asking the Commission not to use soft law, but to introduce a codification, a ‘procedural law’ in the form of a regulation under Article 298 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which ultimately respects the rights of the complainant and takes them seriously. Citizens should be our central focus. We must ensure – when they get so involved and defend the rights of Parliament, of the legislator at European level, against their own Member State – that they also receive appropriate information. I therefore make my appeal once again, as I did last year, to the Commission to take systematic action in this area to improve the situation for complainants once and for all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first I would like to thank Madam Lichtenberger for her report, her continued support and for the gentle pressure she continuously exercises on the Commission in this very important area of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we have clearly indicated in our 2010 annual report on monitoring the application of EU law, it is quite clear that our two institutions attach great importance to the correct application of EU law. I very much appreciate the opportunity to have regular exchanges of views on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the issues raised in the report by Ms Lichtenberger, I would just like to highlight the following points. Firstly, I am very pleased that Parliament endorses the Commission’s Smart Regulation approach. As an important element of this policy, the Commission will continue to assist Member States in their efforts to transpose directives in a timely fashion. If, despite these efforts the Member States miss the transposition deadline, the Commission will systematically propose financial penalties and sanctions, exactly as was highlighted and suggested by Ms Lichtenberger.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will also work with the Member States to ensure that EU law is correctly implemented on the ground. I am equally grateful for the report’s positive tone with regard to the early resolution of problems related to the application of EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will continue to work with the Member States to try to solve the problems. The objective is for the infringement procedure to become unnecessary, since problems could be solved at an earlier stage. This would benefit, first and foremost, citizens and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I repeat once more that, if no solution is found, the Commission will vigorously use the legal instruments at its disposal. The 20th annual report underlined once again that petitions from citizens and businesses are very valuable signals highlighting possible violations of EU law. The same is true for complaints from citizens and organisations, with 4 000 complaints having been received in 2010. I take note of Parliament’s remarks on procedural law under Article 298 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consider that the complainants already benefit from the comprehensive administrative guarantees, and we will have the occasion to continue the discussion on this issue when the report by Mr Berlinguer is tabled in Parliament’s plenary session.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning transparency – the item raised by Ms Lichtenberger on infringement procedures – and especially the transparency of EU pilot projects, the Commission fully complies with the rules laid down in the revised framework agreement from the very start of investigations into cases. The legal and factual elements are often unclear, and since we strive to have correct information and respect the principle of sincere cooperation with the Member States, it is not possible to divulge full information at certain stages of the procedure, especially early on.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes Parliament’s interest in ensuring the correct application of EU law for the benefit of EU citizens and businesses, and the Commission looks forward to continuing its work with Parliament on this very important aspect of the Smart Regulation agenda.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, thank you. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions on the 28th annual report on monitoring the application of EU law (2010), I am pleased to accept the final wording of the report. Proper implementation of EU law in Member States is also directly linked to a need to create a transparent legal framework that is comprehensible to national citizens. Particularly worthy of support is the proposal to introduce additional mechanisms for the enforcement of EU law by Member States, and also Parliament’s call for a procedural law in the form of a regulation under Article 298 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which would ensure that the Commission observes the principles of open, effective and independent European administration, and Parliament can be involved as co-legislator and guardian of legal order.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to emphasise the key role of the EU Pilot system as a method of considering complaints during the first stage of proceedings. Thanks to this practice, in 2010 88 % of infringement proceedings originating from 18 countries taking part in the project did not reach the Court of Justice because the Member States corrected the faulty regulations themselves. The European Commission should, however, tighten up the status of the EU Pilot and extend its application to the whole of the EU, to enable it to be of assistance to an even broader group of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the 28th annual report on monitoring the application of EU law, one cause of concern is the numerous instances of late transposition of EU law, which in turn make it impossible for citizens to cite the new legal provisions. One good solution, therefore, would be to apply Article 260 TFEU, which allows the Commission to ask the Court of Justice to impose financial sanctions on a Member State for late transposition of a directive. In congratulating the rapporteur, I would like to say that I fully support the report and its striving to ensure that EU regulations are clear and transparent, and thus more friendly to citizens. I would like to point out that it is actually petitions submitted by citizens and public organisations that are the main source of information on failure to observe EU law at various levels of power in the Member States. These are thus a key mechanism uniting citizens, Parliament and the Commission. Petitions submitted to the European Parliament have caused proceedings to be instigated for violations of obligations in many areas, such as environmental protection, or failure to respect the fundamental freedoms guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Much has already been achieved on this score, but there is a constant need to improve the European legal system at all levels, and especially at local level. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, for the 28th time the Commission is evaluating the current application of EU law. From the perspective of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to draw attention to the important function that the petition procedure has in this task. As a kind of link between the European Union and its citizens, we experience at first hand where there are problems relating to compliance with EU law.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore important that the Commission informs the Committee on Petitions, as well as individual citizens, comprehensively about infringement proceedings that are already in progress and those that are initiated on the basis of petitions.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is another point that I consider to be very important, however. Most petitions relate to the environment and concern non-compliance with EU law in this area. It is necessary in such instances for the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to intervene at an early stage, before irreparable damage is caused due to EU regulations being disregarded. In environmental matters in particular this is often the case and it is not sufficient for the Commission to assume in the course of the proceedings that the Member State will comply with the applicable laws. By the end of the proceedings we will be wiser, but then it will be a case of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Member States should already be subject to supervision when EU law is being transposed and action should be taken at an early stage if problems come to light. This, however, also involves the Commission being granted the right to check directly at a local level whether EU legislation is being transposed and observed correctly. I realise these are undoubtedly very ambitious aims, but I am sure that the 29th annual report will show whether we have made any progress with them. With this in mind, I wish us all great success in the work we will carry out together!</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, together with the earlier debate, this report shows how we stand with regard to asserting our basic values. It mentions several important issues. It emphasises the role of Member States in administering justice, and the importance of training and cooperation. It welcomes the growing trend for petitions. It attaches importance to a democratic foundation of governance and to a constitutional state. I would like to support the rapporteur’s idea that the narrow interpretation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights – that is, that a Member State can only be called to account at EU level if the Member State transposes and applies EU legislation – is often a source of dissatisfaction and disappointment. Many believe that this is a sign of weakness and lack of credibility in the Union. This is why I would encourage both the Commission and the rapporteur to use the means at their disposal to preserve the letter and spirit of the Treaty, if this is not ensured at Member-State level.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, we all know that lack of knowledge of the laws is not an excuse for breaking them. Yet Mark Twain also said that if you took the time to learn every law, you would not have time to break any of them. What do European institutions do all the time? Overwhelm citizens with new laws, regulations, directives, resolutions, implementing acts, etc., etc. European citizens are crushed by the weight of this constant influx of new legislation that is being imposed on them, and they are not the only ones: the rapporteur’s speech implies that the European Commission itself is crushed by the task of monitoring the application of this massive legislation. How will the European Commission succeed, when monitoring this process is an impossible task even for Hercules? Well, you might say, Hercules was just one man, and we have administration and officials. And you now say that we need even more administration and officials to monitor the implementation of European legislation. Yes, it is true that bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy, that is, taxes are being collected from citizens so that they can be overwhelmed with more and more red tape and new legislation, and I think this is wrong.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the ‘better law-making’ initiative we discussed back in September served as a basis for this second sympathetic report from the rapporteur. The Treaty of Lisbon has undoubtedly given Parliament additional powers at an important time for European integration. Nevertheless, law-making, in concrete terms, remains out of kilter with citizens’ expectations.</p>
      <p sl="it">All this clearly requires careful monitoring and increased cooperation, based on the confidence demonstrated by European institutions in individual Member States to guarantee the uniform and homogeneous application of EU law in all 27 Member States. Law-making must be clearly informed by clarity, transparency and coherence, with respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, but at the same time it needs to challenge the fact that some Member States are somewhat unwilling to support this integration process, which is particularly significant from a legislative perspective.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need workable tools that facilitate the transposition process and allow further judicial cooperation, on the assumption that the infringement procedure is the symptom of a pathology that must be cured by force.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, in its role as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission’s position is not always a pleasant one. Monitoring the application of EU law and having the competence to institute infringement proceedings against Member States means the Commission is not universally popular. This is, however, one of the Commission’s most important tasks. In 2010 we had an acquis of EU legislation consisting of 8 400 Regulations and 2 000 Directives. At the end of 2010, 2 100 infringements had been reported against these. Although this figure is lower than in the previous year, it is still much too high. Parliament is therefore also asking for correlation tables and guidelines on their use. It should be possible to identify clearly from the tables which part of a Directive is being transposed with which national text. After a 10-year blockade by the Council it is pleasing that there is now agreement and the Member States are submitting correlation tables in certain cases. This will make it easier in the future to monitor whether a Directive has or has not been transposed correctly in a certain Member State.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report by Ms Lichtenberger places citizens at the centre of European legislation. It is important for citizens that they have legal certainty and know what rights they have within the single market. If they are affected by or involved in an issue and have drawn attention to an infringement by means of a petition, for example, they must be able to understand the procedures and receive the information that is important to them. We MEPs are faced time and again with problems that are based solely on the poor transposition of EU legislation into national law. This problem must be reduced further in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic structure of the European Union is the subject of much discussion at the moment. The Commission’s report on monitoring the application of EU law makes it clear that this is a complex topic and also involves the Member States. Citizens have a right not only to European legislation being drawn up in accordance with democratic principles, but also to European laws being transposed so they – the citizens – as well as businesses can benefit from them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Member States are also under a democratic obligation in this respect. They are obliged to transpose the legislation. If they fail to fulfil this obligation, they are infringing the European legal order and therefore the rule of law. Observing this rule of law is, however, a necessary condition for the legitimacy of any form of democratic governance. It is a guarantee for citizens that they will be able to benefit from the rights provided for in law. The Commission’s reports show year on year that many Member States frequently flout the transposition deadlines for Directives. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is therefore forced to institute costly infringement proceedings, which are embarrassing for the Member States. Here the Commission must keep a particularly close eye on those Member States with very poor transposition records.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Parliament we are also required to do this. Our citizens are turning to us with increasing frequency with petitions and in this way drawing our attention to transposition infringements by Member States. We must therefore make sure that communication between Parliament and the Commission is improved, so that infringements can be identified and remedied as early as possible. We owe it to our citizens!</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, to move forwards with the integration process, it is not sufficient for us to adopt Union legislation. It is also important for it to be implemented, and the 2010 report shows that there are major failings in some Member States. This is not the case with Romania, which only appeared before the Court of Justice once in 2010. Although the number of times when proceedings were initiated against my country rose in 2010, the authorities successfully remedied the failings before going to Court. This is an example of the efficient cooperation between the Commission and the Romanian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another important point made in the report relates to the role of petitions in monitoring the application of EU law. They are a very good way for citizens to draw attention to breaches of European rules, and the prompt resolution of problems can also lower the risk of a Member State appearing before the Court.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, although it is very late, this is an important subject, because if we do not have regulations and laws, we will have disorder and confusion, and then we will have a dictatorship instead of a democracy. It is therefore worthwhile to discuss this matter.</p>
      <p sl="ga">This is a big mouthful – ‘monitoring the application of EU law’. EU law is complicated enough, the application of it is difficult enough, but monitoring the application of EU law is a fairly big mouthful, as I say. Nevertheless, it is important and the evidence is that it is not happening enough. I shall give you one example, that of fishing. I have become aware of factory ships registered in one country, owned in another country, taking on fish, discards and so forth, mincing them and then registering only what they actually land at port. EU law must be applied equally and fairly across the board.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Ms Lichtenberger: this is a very interesting report on the question of respecting the law. We are engaged in observance of the law by European and national institutions, but perhaps there are times when we should give more weight to how we ourselves lay down the law, and whether we always remember the Treaty provisions that are of greatest importance to us.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Here is an example: the proposals under discussion today concerning reform of the common agricultural policy and the system of direct subsidies to farmers. The differences we see here between Member States in the distribution of subsidies discriminate, they quite clearly discriminate against some Member States, especially new Member States, in a way that is in flagrant breach of Treaty provisions. We should not allow legislation to be laid down that so clearly and blatantly discriminates against some and violates the provisions of the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, allow me to react to some of the comments concerning the EU Pilot system. We in the Commission see this as a very important preventive tool which enables us to redress a situation very swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="en">How does it work? It works in such a way that a Member State has 10 weeks in which to respond or propose a solution. We find it a rather quick procedure, we have had very good results with it so far, and we try not to keep it in the dark. We issued a detailed report on how EU Pilot has been applied, noting that we had an 80% success rate in correcting flawed implementation, and we are working hard on the next annual report, which will be published very soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that the problems raised by Ms Lichtenberger also concern the rights of individual complainants. Here, too, we try to redress the situation, and we have made very clear how we would like to improve the treatment of individual citizens’ complaints. In April we updated our communication on relations with complainants and we codified their rights better. We confirmed that we would acknowledge receipt of complaints within 15 working days. If the Commission decides not to register a complaint, it will give notice of its reasons and provide information about alternative forms of redress.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission affords the possibility of meeting complainants at their request and informs them of the various steps in the procedure. Prior notice is given to the complainant before a case is closed, and the complainant is invited to submit any new comments or new information before this is done. No later than one year from the registration of a complaint, the complainant will be formally notified of whether the case is to be pursued or closed. If the time limit is exceeded the Commission will inform the complainant. If we fail to observe this self-imposed codification of the rules, the complainant will have the right to approach the European Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are really trying to make clear how we intend to treat individual complainants.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the suggestion and proposal by Ms Wikström, we will look into all the points as part of our follow-up. I believe we would react to most of the points as was suggested. Concerning the Member States’ differing levels of quality in the application of EU law, I assure you that in the next report on the application of EU law we will include performances for each Member State with a breakdown by sector, so I think it will be even more transparent than has been the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me two last comments, please. The first is on Ms Regner’s point about the correlation tables. As you know, we had long discussions with Parliament and the Council about the right approach here, and now we are implementing the political declaration governing this issue. In accordance with that, the Commission will present a report on the implementation process by 1 November 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a response to Ms Băsescu: we also plan, in the forthcoming annual report on the application of EU law which is to be adopted in the weeks ahead, to indicate the number of cases that originated in a petition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I was not entirely satisfied by your answer. I consider it a very long period of time if it is possible for a year to pass between notification that a complaint has been received and the issuing of a response. In my view a complainant who makes this effort – and in most cases he will already have been through the entire legal process in his own Member State – deserves more. We are reliant on citizens who are committed to the European Union. If they demonstrate their commitment in this form, we should treat them accordingly. I believe it is necessary and absolutely essential in the long term that we have a procedure here that is clearly formalised and clearly regulates rights, by which I mean an explanation of how the Commission intends to handle this.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to another point: I have nothing against it, should this prove helpful, if an attempt is made together with the Member State to bring about a kind of mutual resolution. That will not always be sufficient, however. We can see that things move relatively quickly in economic matters, for example, when a company institutes proceedings against another due to an infringement of EU law. If, however, the matter relates, for example, to environmental or similar concerns, an area in which a large number of citizens are calling for action by the European Union, or social rights, the proceedings are somewhat slower. I believe that these facts must also be given careful consideration. For my next report I would like us to have clearly formalised the rights of the complainant in relation to the Commission, for these to be really clear and also to be really well communicated.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we really want European law to be applied, after we have decided on it together, following a whole host of procedures in the European Parliament and Council, we must provide information as efficiently and precisely as possible to people who care about such things, who really get involved in European issues. This is a matter of great concern to me. Next time I will look carefully once again to see what developments have been made in this area.</p>
