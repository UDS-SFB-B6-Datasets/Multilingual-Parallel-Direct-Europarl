    <intervention id="2-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the next 12 months will be of vital importance to Europe for our future effectiveness, for our place in the world, for the confidence of our citizens in our ability to meet their expectations. We have every reason to be confident. The agreement on the Treaty of Lisbon was very welcome, but so too was the manner in which it was reached. There was a refusal to be distracted from the primary purpose of equipping the Union with the tools it needs for the future. There was a real determination to get down to business.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, our economic agenda has brought results in terms of growth and jobs, helping to offset the risks of added turbulence this year. We are tackling the big issues: from energy to migration, from employment to development aid, namely in Africa, and in just a few weeks we have an opportunity to underline our global leadership on the fight against climate change in Bali.</p>
      <p sl="en">In short, the European Union is delivering. It was able to overcome the very difficult situation we faced in 2005. The twin-track strategy proposed by the Commission in 2006 has paid off, focusing on concrete results for citizens, and at the same time investing in a solution for the institutional settlement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Union, I believe, is on track for 2008. We need to use this to best effect, implementing our commitments, taking forward key proposals already on the table, keeping up the momentum with new initiatives and, at the same time, keeping long-term challenges on our radar screen. In addition, of course we must respect and promote the process of ratification of the Treaty and show citizens what the European Union can offer in the run-up to the European parliamentary elections of 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore welcome this opportunity to set out the Commission’s contribution to a successful 2008 by presenting our Legislative and Work Programme for 2008. In doing so, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its active involvement in the work of developing this Programme. In particular the comprehensive summary report prepared by the Conference of Committee Chairmen and endorsed by the Conference of Presidents helped to shape our programme. Many Commission proposals are a direct match to the priorities set out in your summary report.</p>
      <p sl="en">But first allow me a quick word on the implementation of the 2007 programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">This time last year we discussed a targeted list of strategic initiatives for delivery this year. To cite just a few of the most visible initiatives, this has meant a series of key actions like the Strategic Energy Review, the recent proposals on labour migration, flexicurity, the wine market, market access.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the end of next month, all the strategic initiatives will have been adopted, with just one exception. This is the Emissions Trading Directive, which I have decided to put back one month to January. The reason for this was to ensure no distraction from the crucial talks in Bali – where I want the European Union to appear united. It will also give us the time to finalise the consultations needed on how to realise the European Union’s agreed targets on greenhouse gas and renewables. I am sure that you will agree that this makes sense and in fact that it can represent time that we gain because the preparation will allow, I am sure, a better possibility of a consensus with our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to the strategic initiatives, we undertook to deliver a large number of priority initiatives over an 18-month period. Many of these are now coming forward. The coming weeks will see proposals on mortgage credit, Trade Defence Instruments and reducing CO2 emissions from cars. We should see a delivery rate of 70 % by year end and at, or close to, 100% by the end of the 18 months, next June.</p>
      <p sl="en">2007 is also proving a crucial year in preparing for the future. In particular, next week we will launch a set of key proposals for the Union’s economic and social future. The single market review will gear up the single market as a strong, innovative and competitive market, bringing direct benefits to consumers and entrepreneurs and positioning Europe to shape globalisation to best effect. Alongside this, we will adopt a vision on how to promote opportunities, access and solidarity in the Europe of the 21st century, to be backed up next year with a full communication on a modernised social agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will be paying particular attention to how we will be able to use the Treaty of Lisbon and its protocols to move forward on services of general interest, using these new opportunities to see how we can bring real added value to ensuring the role of these services in improving the quality of life of all Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much look forward to the reactions of the European Parliament and the Council to the internal market review and the social vision. I believe that, taken together, they give us the balance needed to move ahead in key areas of our economic and social agenda. They show that Europe has the right tools and offers the right platform for our citizens to adapt to and to shape globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now focus on the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008. This is our political programme for 2008. It sets out our main initiatives and builds on our commitment to provide added value to Europe’s citizens. We have sought to strengthen both the policy content and the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for 2007, the work programme for 2008 concentrates on a limited number of new policy initiatives, including 26 strategic initiatives grouped together in 12 packages, which the Commission commits to deliver during the year, and 61 priority initiatives, grouped together in 49 packages, to be delivered over a 12-month to 18-month period.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will centre our initiatives in five areas, which are of direct relevance to everyone in Europe: growth and jobs, sustainable Europe, managing migration, putting the citizens first and Europe as a world partner. We are also determined to strengthen our commitment to better regulation with a guarantee to deliver what we promise.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have noted with particular satisfaction that the European Parliament’s summary report agrees with the key areas of central importance we identify for 2008. Close cooperation among institutions and Member States will be essential to realise our goals. For several of the areas mentioned in your report, concrete initiatives are either already adopted or planned to be adopted still in 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">For next year, I am pleased to be able to note the inclusion in the Programme of a number of initiatives highlighted as of particular interest to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just to list some of the key areas: the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, which we agree remains central to our goals of a more prosperous, environmentally responsible and socially inclusive European Union; climate change, with this year’s stress on mitigation, complemented by a new approach on adaptation; greening of the transport sector; a Small Business Act for SMEs (in fact it is a package of measures for SMEs); legislation to strengthen consumer protection regarding contractual rights and a new Consumer Scoreboard; better access to justice for citizens; improving the regulatory environment in Europe with a strategic review of better regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the bulk of our agenda there is a large degree of agreement between the Commission and Parliament on the need to act and on the way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that there are some suggestions in the summary report where we cannot give a definitive answer at this stage. For example, we are working actively on intellectual property and financial services, but feel that it is premature to fix now the form and level of ambition for specific initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">On waste management, we would accommodate the issues you have raised through the Action Plan on better implementation of waste legislation, rather than a new initiative at this stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make one point clear: what is not included in the list of new initiatives is not being neglected. The Commission’s essential work of implementing Community law, of executing programmes, and of negotiating international agreements, will continue and is made more visible in other parts of the Programme’s text. Also a new chapter on ‘shaping new policies’ seeks to reflect the multiannual nature of most of the activities of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also inserted in the Work Programme the communication priorities, but have added a novelty in this respect: we propose a number of those priorities to the other institutions so that we can work together to promote them.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this is not about centralisation – quite the contrary. We believe that a common understanding of priorities offers the springboard for ‘going local’, adapting communication to best fit different needs in different parts of the Union. We also believe that in this communication area partnership is crucial if we really want to connect Europe to its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission looks forward to a lively and fruitful debate reflecting the strategic dimension of the Commission’s work programme and a strong political message to our citizens. The year 2008 is indeed a crucial year for Europe. Together the European Commission and the European Parliament can build on our excellent work together in 2007, can make the difference and can make, I am sure, 2008 a great year for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Commission President, I would also like to extend a very warm welcome to the many members of the Commission who are present for this debate today.</p>

    <intervention id="2-011" speaker_id="1920" name="Hartmut NASSAUER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group" nationality="Germany" birth_date="17-10-1942" birth_place="Marburg/Lahn" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by saying to you, Commission President, that having heard your minatory words last year about the attendance of Members of this House, there are more Members than Commissioners in the Chamber today, and I trust that you have noted that fact with gratification. On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I also voice some words of encouragement: we encourage you, during the coming year – the crucial year for the ratification of the new Treaty – to utilise your Commission's most important competence, namely the right to bring forward legislative proposals for Europe, in a way which ensures that you address the issues of serious concern to citizens effectively and utilise the opportunities at your disposal to narrow the gap between citizens and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We support your general approach as set forth in your programme, as well as the priorities you have chosen, from growth and jobs – whose success is crucial to underpin social cohesion in Europe – to many other detailed aspects, up to and including migration and research. My colleagues will focus on individual issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">We welcome the fact that you have indeed taken up various proposals arising from the structured dialogue with the committees. We would like to see this dialogue being intensified even further. We would also welcome it if your planning were not only to cover the first few months of 2009 but were perhaps to encompass a two-year cycle which could be developed further on a year-by-year basis. What we feel is missing is an indicative time schedule, and we also see a gap between your programme and the budgetary procedure, which it would be sensible to close.</p>
      <p sl="de">You intend to bring forward a total of 79 legislative initiatives and around the same number of non-legislative actions. If we look at this in terms of your stated intention to reduce bureaucracy, I am not sure whether you are genuinely serving that objective. The items of legislation whose repeal you have announced notably include many which would have expired anyway. To that extent, reducing bureaucracy is more about 'talking a good game' than achieving a real and effective objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">Next year is the year of the new Treaty. You have the opportunity – and I am confident that this Treaty will come into force – to incorporate this Treaty into your programme already at this stage. The Treaty will bring in important new elements: operability, transparency and democracy. It will also bring in an element which is vital for us and to which I recommend you devote some attention, and that is the principle of subsidiarity. A new debate on subsidiarity is starting in Europe, and the main partner for that debate is you, Mr President, and your Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">A storm of protest erupted in some parts of Germany a few days ago over the issue of fruit and apple wines. I do not want to discuss the public reaction to this issue in detail, but let me say this, Mr President: what sort of spirit is at large in an administration which, at one bureaucratic stroke, obliterates regional traditions which go back hundreds of years, and does so in such a cold and insensitive way? There is a problem with this approach, and it is your problem, Mr President. It is a problem with your Commission. You now have an opportunity, in the spirit of the new Treaty, to create a new culture of subsidiarity. That is the opportunity – the great opportunity – for your Commission to achieve more consensus among the population at large, and it is an opportunity which we in the PPE-DE Group would expressly encourage you to seize with both hands.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commission President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, may I also welcome you very warmly on behalf of my Group. Much of what the Commission President has said and which is included in this document meets with our approval. I would like to focus on two points which are crucial, in our view. These points are addressed at the end of your programme. I would have liked to see them included at the beginning, but their location in the text does not make them any less important.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first point is communication. I can only endorse what Mr Nassauer has said. We must convey a clear message to citizens about what Europe is all about and what we are trying to achieve with our various legislative proposals; otherwise, we are wasting our time. I am very pleased with the approach to the issue of communication – which also lies in the hands of Madam Vice-President – and the proposals she has put forward, which envisage a joint approach with Parliament. However, it is also a question of the language we use when we communicate with citizens and how we convey the message about what we are trying to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last year, we dealt with a number of items of legislation which improved the legal position of consumers, notably in telecommunications and other sectors. However, we have still not managed to convince our citizens satisfactorily that we are here for them and that we are not an elite group of people working away somewhere in Brussels. We need to do more here. I hope, Madam Vice-President, that you will be able to say a few words at the end of this debate about what you are planning in specific terms, for it is our common goal, and that is a message which we must convey in 2008 in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is another important sentence which is also to be found towards the end of the document. It talks about social problems and the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation, in particular jobs and migration and citizens' concerns. Unfortunately, Mr President, the document you have presented to us does not contain many answers to these questions. This is not just a matter for the Social Affairs Commissioner, who is also doing good work. This dimension must be addressed by the Commission as a whole. Indeed, it is a matter for the President of the Commission himself. He, too, must focus on achieving this social Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are many areas involved here, and I would like to cite just two of them. One of them is international trade. Is it not a scandal that there are still European companies which are reliant on child labour in India and other countries? What are we doing to tackle this? This situation creates fears here in Europe and exacerbates poverty. That is borne out by various studies: it exacerbates poverty in countries which are our trading partners. In other words, trade policy must also include a social dimension, perhaps by means of social clauses.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">As to immigration policy, your document talks about 'an integrated approach to migration'. Would it not be better to say: 'no migration without integration'? Indeed, should the Commission not have been sending out a much clearer and unequivocal message here? Yesterday, we discussed this issue with Commissioner Frattini. His initial comments about the situation of the Roma population in Rome, for example, were not very encouraging. His statements yesterday were much clearer and more helpful. Is it not the case that the Roma issue is also one which we have often neglected, not only in the new Member States but in the old ones as well?</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are saying 'no migration policy without integration policy'. Surely this is an approach which the Commission should have adopted long ago? I doubt that Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel mean the same thing as we Social Democrats do when they talk about integration. Nonetheless, the basic message is absolutely correct and the Commission must adopt a much clearer approach here.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Combating right-wing extremism is therefore not only about addressing the issue on an ideological level; it is of course about social issues as well. Unemployment, social exclusion and anti-social elements are still present in our society and are being exploited by the extreme right in their campaign against Europe. For that reason, Europe and the European Commission must take action here.</p>
      <p sl="de">My colleague Mr Schulz, the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has often said that we want a social Europe. That is our primary goal and it should be the primary goal of this programme as well. You have said that we can make '2008 a great year for Europe'. We think that 2008 should be a great year for social Europe. My plea to you, Commission President, is this: please, take the lead in achieving this social Europe!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this is a political programme which suits a year in which the pace of integration is going to quicken dramatically with the completion of the Reform Treaty process and the expansion of the Schengen and the euro zones.</p>
      <p sl="de">But preparing for the bringing into force of the Treaty will be our principal task and here the Liberal Group have two principal concerns. First: that in building the area of freedom, security and justice the integration of the third pillar with the first should be as fast and comprehensive as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">And secondly, with relation to the CFSP, reaching a first class agreement between the Council, Commission and Parliament upon the setting up of the external service promises to be fairly exciting and quite tricky.</p>
      <p sl="de">To explain and justify the Treaty to national parliaments and to public opinion, we ought to put greater stress on the social and cultural dimension of the single market, such as migration policy, as well as on the fight to combat climate change. These things will assist us to sell the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The CAP Check should be directly associated with the future reform of the financial system through an expansion of a cofinancing of the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I should be grateful to hear the college’s assessment of President Sarkozy’s plan to establish a further ‘Comité des Sages’ to brood on the future of Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-014" speaker_id="4255" name="Pierre JONCKHEER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group" nationality="Belgium" birth_date="10-05-1951" birth_place="Namur" p_group="Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance" m_state="BE">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioners, you have presented us with 26 strategic initiatives and 61 priority initiatives. I am not going to comment on all of them in four minutes. In debates of this kind it must always be borne in mind that the Commission has a responsibility and a quite special role to play in the Community decision-making process. It is you who have the monopoly on legislative initiatives and it is you who wield the power by screening the various amendments, whether they come from Parliament or from the Council. You have huge responsibility for the type of result that we are able to obtain as far as Community legislation is concerned. I can therefore assure you that, as ever, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is probably the most united of all the political groups in its support for this Community procedure, because I believe that the Commission has been entrusted with a formidable task in having to confront not only national interests but also the sensitivities of the various national governments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To get straight to the heart of the matter there are three points that I would like to raise. The first is energy policy: 2007 has been a big year. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded and the March European Council adopted a number of objectives that in our view could have been more ambitious, but which we supported nevertheless. As you have pointed out, 2008 will now be a year for implementation. This is where some real vigilance will be called for on our part. We were really disappointed by the results on vehicle emissions. We believe that your approach to biofuels ignores the negative impact that this type of technology is having on our environment. We are of the view that in the second phase of emission permits we should be moving towards a bidding system rather than freely distributing what amount to nothing more than new financial assets. We are somewhat surprised that as far as the internalisation of transport policy costs is concerned you have only announced what amounts to no more than methodological studies. It appears to me that the economists have been debating this for at least 15 years and that the Commission could follow the example set by good national experience.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also think that this thinking needs to be applied to all aspects of energy policy, and that you should resist the idea of making too much use of so-called ‘soft’ instruments in order to please different lobbies or to meet different governmental requests. We need to employ restrictive instruments because the example set by the car industry shows us that voluntary agreements do not really work. As regards renewable energies we do not believe it is a very good idea to introduce flexible arrangements between the Member States. Everyone should do their bit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second subject that I wish to raise concerns immigration policy. This is one area for which you have supreme responsibility. I recall the speech that Kofi Annan made to the European Parliament several years ago. It would be wonderful if the European Union could win the Nobel Peace Prize for a successful immigration policy. We are counting on you to see to it that such an immigration policy, which you have included in your work programme, and which has already commenced, does not result in the introduction of a common biometric passport for all Member States. I think that as well as creating a disastrous situation for people here, that would also damage the EU’s credibility in the eyes of the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the last point I wish to raise – and this surprises me, Mr Barroso – is the fact that your programme does not include anything on the international financial markets. If you want the citizens of the Community, or at least a large majority of them, to be more positively disposed towards globalisation and its various issues then the European Union, and the Commission in particular, cannot dissociate itself from the situation in the financial markets, the continued investigation of tax havens and our inability to debate issues surrounding the exchange rates between the euro, the Chinese yuan and the dollar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that people are waiting for the European Union to deliver ambitious initiatives that will ensure that the financial markets operate for the benefit of the economy and society, not the other way round. I am reminded of the debates that Parliament held on this subject at the start of the current legislative period. Various people now appear to have lost all sight of this. For this reason it seems important to me that you should re-launch such an initiative with the backing of Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="2-015" speaker_id="1018" name="Francis WURTZ" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group" nationality="France" birth_date="03-01-1948" birth_place="Strasbourg" p_group="Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, along with my fellow Members I listened closely to what Mr Barroso said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">He set out the Commission’s strategic objectives, with growth and employment naturally being at the top of the list of priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I noted that, as in the communication from the Commission, there was something singularly missing from his presentation and I would now like to ask the Commission President quite specifically about this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is it true that on 23 October the College of Commissioners debated a proposal that had been put by Mr Mandelson concerning European firms and businesses that had moved their production to third countries where wage levels were low? This proposal was possibly aimed at exempting the said companies from the anti-dumping duties that apply to products exported to the Union at prices that are significantly lower than their normal value.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Is it true that this proposal received a large measure of support and that the Commission is to take a formal decision on this subject after 5 December?</p>
      <p sl="fr">How do you respond to those who see in such a measure nothing more than a financial subsidy for relocating production? Would such a move not be totally inconsistent with those sections of the Commission communication that we are discussing here today, including the following:</p>
      <p sl="fr">Recent research shows that the main concern for EU citizens is ‘the social dimension of the EU in the context of globalisation (in particular jobs and the fear of unemployment).’ Or else: ‘The global competitiveness agenda contributes to creating lasting growth and jobs at home.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why was there no mention either in your presentation or in the Commission communication of the legislative programme for 2008 or of any project relating to major political issues such as the promotion of employment in the EU, industrial policy and, more generally, the benefits that the Community can derive from the current phenomenon of globalisation?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, is it true that, foreseeing the major disruption that such a subject could cause during a vote in Parliament, not to say in the Council, you are planning to bypass the legislators by opting for guidelines instead?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that my Group is not the only one here hoping for a clear response from you to these questions, failing which each of us will have to consider what form of reaction would be the most appropriate. If you enjoyed the manner in which the House mobilised its efforts against the Bolkestein Directive then you will certainly love the outcry that will be caused by the Mandelson Regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with your permission, I would like to start my speech in Irish.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I approve of the Commission’s projected legislative and work programme. The Commission is aiming above all to promote job creation and development in Europe; to make the EU come to grips with the problem of climate change; to bring about a common policy on migration; to give pride of place to EU citizens; and to ensure that the EU acts as a force for good all over the world.</p>
      <p sl="ga">And of course the whole issue of globalisation is one that will concentrate our minds over the next number of years – not just in the short term for 2008 – and I welcome the initiatives taken in particular by the Commission to prepare Europe to deal with the effects and impacts, both positive and negative, of what globalisation will mean.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We can see around the world that there is a threat to democracy also, and the actions that we must take with regard to ensuring that we can best deliver not just aid and assistance to those who are in trouble but also the promotion of the values of democracy, the rule of law, the separation of powers. We have seen in recent weeks that Pakistan, Georgia and other parts of the world are suffering from new forms of resistance towards democratic controls, new threats regarding the freedom of the press, and, most importantly of all, the annihilation of the will of the people to be heard and to be recognised within those networks.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In particular, the continuing crisis around the world – particularly in the developing world with regard to the AIDS, HIV and other areas – requires us to be more imaginative and innovative in how best we can deal with these areas.</p>
      <p sl="ga">But one issue in particular concerns me as we look to the future, in particular the short-term future, and that is the whole question of taxation within the European Union. Many of us have grave concerns with regard to proposals coming forward from the Commission concerning corporation tax, the common consolidated base for corporation tax and, in particular, the relentless desire of certain Commissioners to drive forward the proposal which we – I and others in this House – believe the Commission does not have the legislative or legal basis to move forward on.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I am delighted that the Lisbon Reform Treaty has ensured that the issues of taxation still require unanimity. I am delighted at the fact that no changes can be made without the 27 governments agreeing.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There is a place in Europe for ensuring that there is competition, not just in economic and in environmental terms, but also in the whole area of taxation. This tax competition is healthy, and we must be given assurances that any proposals coming forward will not have a negative impact with regard to economic growth and employment growth, which is so necessary for the peoples of Europe. Even if you look at America there is tax competition within the states and it appears to be working extremely well there.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The last point that I would make is that, as we look to the future and move forward, the peoples of Europe are not asking for more bureaucracy, they are not asking for more regulation. They are asking for vision and a rapid response to the real problems that they face on a day-to-day basis, not some abstract ideologies from an ancient past which I hope we have left behind us.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, there is an election in Denmark today. I hope that the new Danish Parliament will have members who take the trouble to read the Commission’s annual programme and the EU legislative proposals and consider them. For it is the EU that determines our laws, and it is sad to have experienced an election battle where the formulation of laws is simply not debated. Instead, in Denmark there have been discussions concerning municipal and regional matters such as food at playschools, education and hospitals. The Danish input into the legislative process within the EU is not being discussed amongst the elected people’s representatives; democracy is being drained as a form of government.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Commission’s annual programme should ideally be distributed for consideration by all the specialist committees within all the national parliaments and, in connection with this, all parties should take a position on what should be legislated at EU level and what should be kept under national jurisdiction. Proximity and necessity controls – or subsidiarity and proportionality to use EU jargon – should be considered by the national parliaments, first in connection with the annual programme and then subsequently when the Commission submits the various legislative proposals. This could connect the national parliaments with the EU and give citizens the opportunity to be involved before they receive a decree from Brussels, which has also promised to comply with the recommendations of the national parliaments, yet very few come. The national parliaments are asleep on the job, and it is depressing for those of us who are fighting for them, but it is good to see so many Commissioners at once.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the work programme presented here shows exactly how easily official Europe bandies about the crucial term ‘subsidiarity’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission thus assumes, entirely in keeping with Mr Frattini’s earlier initiatives, definitive jurisdiction over the legal aspect of labour migration, whereas in my view it is solely the remit of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission is putting pressure on European citizens with what I see as an extremely debatable response to the demographic challenges of another mass influx of workers from non-European countries, for which there is not the slightest democratic support or agreement from our own European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let me be very clear about this: a new wave of immigration, even a legal one, with everything that accompanies a continuing migration and the so-called reunification of families, will make the existing and already very serious integration problems even worse, to say nothing of the brain drain that we are apparently shamelessly allowing to the detriment of the countries of origin.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is at a time – and I want to emphasise this – when there are already millions and millions of former immigrants of non-European origin in Europe, some already third or even fourth generation, who are still unemployed and have barely educated themselves to the point where they can be integrated, let alone assimilated: a proletariat on social security.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is remarkable that the Commission has also taken it upon itself to get involved in the education policy of the Member States. The communication on ‘Communicating Europe in Partnership’, to which this work programme refers, actually states that the Commission will examine how schools could best provide students with the key competences, and how school communities can help prepare young people to be</p>
      <p sl="nl">responsible citizens, in line with fundamental European values. I wonder: will enlightened European Mandarins in the future tell us how we must think, how we must behave? Is ‘Big Brother Europe’ already so close at hand?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission claims to put its own European citizens first, but in reality it frequently behaves like an emperor or keizer-koster ; often ready with the lecturing finger and wagging head of a frustrated teacher. Mr Barroso himself came to the Netherlands earlier this year to tell the Dutch that that is quite enough now, that they had better not worry about a referendum and that it is high time for them to accept the principles of the European Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this way these same great European democrats make every effort to ensure that our citizens do not have the chance to express their opinions regarding both the pseudo-Constitution and the possible accession of Turkey. Regarding my own country, Mr Barroso, together with other European Mandarins, is happy to come and tell us what to do about the problems between Flanders and Wallonia, while not even bothering to find out what is happening on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In conclusion, and I fear this is not the first time I have said this in this Hemicycle, nor must it be the last, this official Europe apparently does not provide for democracy, does not provide for subsidiarity, does not provide a clear and sharp delineation of powers between Europe and the Member States. For this reason it also does not surprise me that this so-called Reform Treaty is, apart from a few cosmetic alterations, identical to the former Constitution and is therefore only a disguised version of this totally illegible, dark and veiled document that renders the normal functioning of citizen-controlled democracy out of the question.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, o sonho europeo , the European dream, der Europäische Traum ! I think that the vast majority of Europeans have a fairly clear idea and generally agree on what this should be. That being the case, why is there so much mistrust directed towards the Commission in so many countries? You say that it has to do with communication. However, a great many citizens, even those who only consider these problems in passing, are saying, no, it has to do with the specific projects, and it has to do with the Lisbon Strategy and its obvious failure to date.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Swoboda says that the social dimension is missing and I must admit that on this issue, he is right. However, at the same time, Mr Duff has said that the social dimension of the Constitutional Treaty – my apologies, you call it the Reform Treaty – must be the focal point. That is all very well, but where does it say anything about the social dimension there? In which form is this Treaty actually readable, and where in this Treaty does it say anything about basic democratic principles such as the separation of powers? If you actually did what you said and what you apparently intend – namely to convey the message effectively and implement your intentions in a way which is verifiable in hard data – communication would become far less of a problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The President of the European Court of Auditors offered you a very clear starting point yesterday evening. He mentioned very specific numbers for the first time: EUR 4 billion incorrectly disbursed from the Structural Funds alone. Let me quote from his speech: ‘ The most frequent errors were claims for ineligible expenditure and failure to carry out tender procedures as well as a lack of evidence to support the calculation of overheads or the staff costs involved. The supervisory and control systems in the Member States were generally ineffective or moderately effective, and the Commission maintains only a moderately effective supervision of their functioning.’</p>
      <p sl="de">You need to take action. Please do not attempt to improve communication about what you are not doing! That is bound to go wrong.</p>

    <intervention id="2-024" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank all the groups for their very interesting and challenging comments. Let me first try to answer some specific issues, and then I shall make some general comments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to thank Mr Nassauer for the general support he gave to our priorities. Regarding the main issue – subsidiarity – he mentioned, let me say that we are as committed as he to the goal he has set, more precisely: to create a new culture of subsidiarity in Europe and to give our own example. I really am committed to that. I am not pretending that we are perfect. Sometimes it is difficult to change old habits, but we are moving in the right direction. When there are mistakes, which sometimes happens, then we try to correct them. The recent case we mentioned regarding the Apfelwein is a good example of that, and we should accept that sometimes we cannot foresee all the consequences of the regulations we are preparing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to assure you that I and the college that is present here are committed to subsidiarity. In all our initiatives we are now looking at the need for a specific legislative initiative – the impact assessment and the quality of our proposals – and we try to do it that way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just highlight that, out of the 26 strategic initiatives I have announced, only 8 are of a legislative nature; out of 61 priority initiatives, only 28 are of a legislative nature; out of 87, only 36 are of a legislative nature in general. On top of this, we will withdraw 30 pieces of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the point I want to make to you is the following: when we speak about the new culture of subsidiarity, I need your help to explain to our citizens that this is in order to strengthen the European Union, not to weaken it; in order to make the institutions more democratic and more accountable, and not to give in to those who are attacking Europe and the European Union in a populist, demagogic way. This is not the way I see subsidiarity. Sometimes, in some of our Member States, people say that, because of subsidiarity, the Commission or the European Parliament should not come forward with this kind of programme because this goes against subsidiarity. In fact, if what they do not want is the European Union to act when European action is needed, then I do not agree that this is indeed in favour of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">To give you a recent example: in March the European Council adopted, as you know, some very important ideas for energy and the environment, namely protection against climate change. For instance, we adopted the general principles of unbundling. This was a decision of the European Council. However, I have sometimes heard some Member States state that the Commission should not insist on unbundling, because this is against the principle of subsidiarity. I do not agree with this, and I have to say so. It is, in fact, resistance to an important European movement that is in favour of creating a real internal market for energy and of having a very strong policy against climate change. This is not in favour of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the point where we need your help. We need your help to explain when the European Union action is needed, and to be critical of us when you think that European action is not needed, so that we should, if necessary, scrap some legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will come back to Mr Swoboda’s point on communication later, but I think he is right. In fact, I, together with Vice-President Wallström and the whole college, are working on this. But the basic idea is, precisely, partnerships. Let us be honest about this. We cannot do everything by ourselves. When I say ‘we’, I mean the European institutions – the Commission and the European Parliament. We need the active involvement of leaders at all levels – national and regional. This is important for subsidiarity. For instance, the Länder in Germany, the regions in most of our Member States, are critically important, and my college and I have been all over Europe in the national parliaments, sometimes in the different regions, explaining. I was recently in Poland, saying this very clearly, saying that Europe is not them in Brussels or Strasbourg: Europe is us, all over Europe, and this is a collective responsibility. That is, once again, a change of paradigm, because if you want to motivate the citizens for the European idea, we have to share with them those priorities and not just think about ‘some people in Brussels or in Strasbourg’ telling the other citizens what they should or should not do.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have mentioned the social dimension. I could not, of course, highlight all the points. Let me just tell you that in our programme there are many legislative and non-legislative initiatives in this area. Most importantly, we will conclude the work on stock-taking of European society with the vision of how to promote opportunities, access and solidarity in the Europe of the 21st century. This will pave the way for a new social agenda and provide the framework for a dynamic and modern approach to the contribution of European Union policy to European society today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will also submit proposals to amend the European Works Council Directive in order for them to anticipate and accompany restructuring. Another piece of legislation will concern the conditions of pregnant women, aiming at improving existing maternity protection provisions with a view to reconciling professional, private and family life.</p>
      <p sl="en">An initiative will concern the deepening of the open method of coordination in the areas of social protection and social inclusion. This will be accompanied by a recommendation on active inclusion of people furthest from the labour market, concentrating on three pillars: job opportunities and vocational training, income support, and better access to quality services. This takes place in the context of the overall Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission will adopt the communication on anticipating and managing change, launching the second phase of consultation of European social partners on anticipating company restructuring. Just to give you some examples that we are indeed committed to the social agenda in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Duff, as regards the need to ratify the Treaty, as you understand, I fully share that priority, and I think, precisely, that the social and cultural dimension of Europe should be highlighted. I am doing my best in this matter, trying to explain that in Europe we need a strong internal market, but Europe is more than a market, and I think you can agree that this is also a shared commitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the ‘Wise Men’s Group’ proposal of President Sarkozy, about which you have asked for my opinion, the Commission has discussed this issue. We are, naturally, in favour of any initiative that promotes debate and reflection on the future of Europe. As real democrats we like debate. That is perhaps our tropisme , but we like debate, we like ideas and the exchange of ideas. So I think that President Sarkozy’s initiative should be seen as part of the promotion of such debate and reflection. However, the Commission is keen to make sure that this initiative, if it were to be approved by the European Council, does not undermine our efforts to build on the success of the Lisbon Treaty and, most of all, does not undermine its certification.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must be clear about this. That is why we think that this group, in the event of approval by the European Council, should not engage in a new institutional debate. I do not think it would be wise to do this, so I will ask the ‘Wise Men’ (and women, hopefully!) to be wise enough not to open new institutional debates, but rather to concentrate on a vision for Europe in 20 or 30 years’ time. This is important, and why should we not have a good debate on this?</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not, either, engage in a negative debate about the geographical limits of the borders of Europe. This could be divisive, and it should not undermine our ongoing processes at European level, such as the budgetary review and normal conduct of enlargement negotiations. It is important because of defending institutions. We are for all kinds of debate, but let us be honest: we have institutions. We have the European Parliament, we have the Commission, we have the European Council and, in the end, the institutions are responsible – not wise men or, as we would prefer maybe to say, ‘the bright kids’ – and what they could bring as a stimulus to our debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also believe that the timing of the report of such a group should be given careful consideration; the end of 2009 seems appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Jonckheer, thank you for your comments, especially as regards the Community method and the Greens’ support for it. We shall be very mindful of this. You will doubtless have noticed that during the debate on the Reform Treaty – the Lisbon Treaty – certain attempts were made to dilute the Community process. The Commission, which had cooperated effectively with Parliament, managed to avoid anything that could challenge the principles of the Community system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You said that 2007 has been an important year for the ‘great cause’, namely the challenge of climate change, and we in the Commission and in the European Union are proud to have contributed to this effort. Indeed, the Commission’s Green Paper provided the basis for the agreement that was eventually reached at the March European Council. The European Union can be proud of having taken the lead in this area and it intends to continue its efforts in this direction, especially with the forthcoming Bali Conference and in the wake of major recent meetings such as the High-Level Event in New York and the G8 at Heiligendamm, which also proved decisive. It will do this with a view to launching a process that, by the time of the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, will lead – we hope – to the establishment of a post-Kyoto regime by 2012. This really is an ambitious target. In any event, we are aware that we need to motivate our other partners in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Turning to the issue of migration you say that the European Union should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It could also be similarly recognised for its activities in other areas, too. In fact, I think that the European Union has long merited a Nobel Peace Prize, for when it comes to the experience of peace in the world there are few regions better qualified than the European Community, now the European Union. Let me give you an example. This month I am going to Singapore to take part in the ASEAN Summit and the Association invited me because it is seeking inspiration, based on our experience of regional integration, to work for peace, economic growth and social development. We should be proud to be an example to others in the world and this is something that we are working at continuously.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of migration I wish to reply here to several questions that have been raised by Members of this Parliament. I have said this repeatedly and I say it again here: I find that it is absurd to have to deal with 27 migration policies in Europe. We have an integrated area here and we therefore need to have a common approach. Now let us be clear: some Member States are against it. However, we shall persist, for in an integrated area there is a greater probability of being confronted with problems of the kind that Italy has had to face recently, including that posed by certain citizens from Romania. We need more immigration in Europe, not less: that is the truth of the matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we are calling for an immigration policy that is responsible and that is based on two key aspects. Firstly, we have to be resolute when it comes to security by openly combating all forms of exploitation in the workplace and by eliminating the illegal labour market. For this reason we fully support the initiative put forward by Vice-President Frattini for a directive that will criminalise the employment of persons residing illegally in EU territory, the objective being to prevent the exploitation of such workers and to crack down on the criminal networks involved. We have to deal firmly with illegal immigration and with all types of activities that act as a cover for certain networks that are often nothing more than criminal gangs, for these groups are not only connected with illegal immigration but also with drug dealing, human trafficking and other forms of organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time we need to adopt an open, generous and united approach to the problem of how to integrate, first and foremost, those who are Community citizens and then, more generally, those who belong to the various migrant groups. We need to have the courage to say that this is a task that has to be shared out. The role of the European institutions is to put the framework in place, but when it comes to the practical side of things who will take care of the actual integration process on the ground? Not the European Parliament and not the Commission, but the national governments, the regions, the local authorities, the NGOs and sometimes even the churches, indeed everyone who has a presence on the ground and who has a duty to improve integration. All this is a major challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You mentioned Kofi Annan. I have discussed this matter with him on several occasions. If there is one area that is poorly regulated on a global scale it is migration. We have laid down certain organisational principles for world trade and indeed for the environment, too. It is astonishing to note that migration, which is one of the greatest challenges the world has to face, is one area where organisation is lacking on an international level. I support your proposal that we in the European Union –precisely because we are a special case when it comes to integration and freedom of movement – should double our efforts to promote certain principles because Europe and the wider world are currently facing real threats in the form of xenophobia, populist movements and negative forces from the past that are opposed to those principles that we uphold, namely humanism and hospitality. We have to steer well clear of extremist positions and must work towards a rational, fair and progressive approach.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Wurtz, you asked a number of questions about trade protection instruments. First of all, I referred to these instruments in my speech by saying that we would very soon be introducing several initiatives in this area. Let me say to you that we are very much in favour of establishing effective mechanisms for safeguarding our commercial interests and providing protection against unfair practices. It is for this reason that we are presently looking at various ways of making these instruments more effective. What is more, we shall do this in a transparent fashion. A major consultation has just taken place with a view to ensuring that our businesses, especially the SMEs, are better equipped to cope with international competition. We intend to take the relevant decisions in this area in December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It should be recognised that Europe’s businesses are the most international in the world. European production and distribution chains have now been established in every corner of the planet and are not merely restricted to the Member States. We believe that this business presence on the global stage is a source of competitiveness and growth for the European economy and for European jobs. I can assure you that we have no intention of rewarding or subsidising European companies that decide to relocate to third countries or set up part of their production facilities there. However, I will be completely honest with you in saying that we are not going to sanction or punish the European companies that are the most global and the most competitive in the world. We therefore need trade protection instruments that are both solid and transparent. We shall be reviewing our trade protection instruments with a view to introducing stronger measures – and indeed it will never be our intention to weaken them – by adapting them, obviously, to the new realities of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am not going to dwell on the topic of globalisation. I shall be back here again tomorrow to discuss the document that we presented to the last European Council, and to the Community at large, on bringing added value to Europe and on the means for shaping globalisation to best effect. We are very aware of the need to defend European interests around the world, to protect our interests without resorting to protectionism, to comprehend and to have the courage to say to the people of Europe that if we in Europe close our doors we will be the first ones to suffer. It will not be easy but it has to be done. Europe is the world’s largest exporter. It would be self-defeating and against our own interests if we were to go down the road of protectionism. The important thing is to work out how to keep our doors open without being naïve, how to maintain and even extend the opening-up of the global markets while at the same time defending our own interests, and this includes taking account of our concerns for the employment sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Crowley, thank you also for your support for our general programme. About the specific point – I know it is a worry and concern for you – let me be clear about the initiatives on taxation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the Commission has been working for some time on the issue of a common consolidated tax base. This is a very complex area and views are very different between Member States. I know well the sensitivity in Ireland. I also know the sensitivity in other Member States. As is usual practice, the Commission is carrying out an impact assessment to analyse the issues and to look at the likely impact of different possible solutions before making any formal proposals. All of this is public knowledge and it is entirely appropriate that the Commission refers to this in the work programme for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But I agree with you that it is clear that unanimity is in the Reform Treaty as the rule for any legislation on these issues of taxation. So I believe that your concerns are well taken on board.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think I have reacted to most of your interesting remarks. Let me just say that I, of course, concentrated on the most, let us say, polemic issues. What I want to say is that we could see here a degree of consensus about Europe. A consensus that I believe is stronger between the institutions, also with the natural differences between political families and I hope also consensus between the different parts of our very diverse Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This, I think, is not the lowest common denominator consensus. It is mainly the result of three factors. First, many of the challenges facing us today are impossible to contest. The imperatives of climate change, the realities of migration, and the risk of worldwide poverty: all these are clear challenges. And you can be from the left, the right or the centre, you can be from the north or south of Europe, from the old Member States or new Member States, from small or big Member States, yet these are common challenges that only together we can face.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second, we are making it progressively clear that the European Union is central to resolving these issues. Action by individual Member States can only go so far but it becomes more and more obvious that the European dimension is indispensable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course we have to see what is the appropriate level of using the European dimension – the subsidiarity issue that was raised by some of you – but I think that we can agree that even the biggest Member States alone cannot face all those challenges and that we need some level of European commitment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I believe the effort all the institutions have put into dialogue and cooperation is paying off. We are wasting less of our energies in scoring points against each other and more on focussing on how to serve our citizens – and always putting the emphasis on the citizens. A strong Union, yes, but a strong Union not for the sake of the institutions themselves, but a strong Union to deliver concrete results for our citizens: this is our programme. I think that, 50 years on, the genius of the founding fathers in creating our unique mix of institutions is as strong as ever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, I very much look forward to working closely with Parliament as we carry forward proposals on the table into action, as we crystallise our thinking into concrete measures and as we develop our new agenda for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On my own behalf and on behalf of all the college, I want to tell you that we really want to have a working, loyal and dynamic interaction with Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to address the Commission’s agenda, particularly in the economic sector, not only because this is the area where the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ interest mostly lies, but it is also of vital importance to the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission must keep its active role in building a genuine single market for financial services. It is topical for a good reason. Firstly, the recent financial turmoil has underlined the importance of sound financial regulation. Secondly, the financial world is more and more intertwined. We must be able to build convergence with our main allies overseas. Transatlantic Market initiatives started a very important process which is especially critical to the capital markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">A few years ago a groundbreaking legislative process in the form of the Lamfalussy procedure was successfully introduced. The Lamfalussy procedure is the first attempt to shift widely to delegated legislation in the EU. Even though the first experiences from this procedure are positive, it is crucial to keep on building trust between institutions. The working relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission in this process are very important.</p>
      <p sl="de">As for the follow-up, firstly, the Lamfalussy procedure is basically a sound process that is welcomed by stakeholders. It is also in its early stages. It is developing all the time. Therefore no overhaul is appropriate at this point, nor is it the wish of most stakeholders. Rather we need targeted improvements – particularly Level 3 Committees – there is a lot of scope for improvement in their international cooperation, to challenge each other and explain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say about tax-related issues that the Commission should keep its active role. Even though taxation might seem a bit difficult, and we all know that it is still beyond unanimity, we must be very courageous in putting forward action in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Enhanced cooperation is a good innovation and the other items of the Commission’s agenda in the field of tax are also very important.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Commission, I believe that the people of Europe have very high expectations when it comes to the social dimension of European integration and that the strengthening of this social pillar is the weak link, if not to say the missing link, in the Commission’s strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to stop opposing the strategy for growth, the establishment of the single market and the strengthening of the social pillar. This is a key factor for the support of the peoples of Europe and it is also, quite simply, an essential condition for the success of the Lisbon Strategy and for strengthening the competitiveness and economic efficiency of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this respect there is a striking contrast with the awareness of the challenges posed by climate change, which effectively seemed to stem from last year’s spring summit, and indeed the priorities laid down in the Commission’s work programme contain more than a trace of this. We are a long way from displaying the same enthusiasm when it comes to meeting the challenges posed by social inclusion and the need to create a Europe that works for everyone, a Europe capable of promoting not just more jobs but better jobs too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are declarations of intent and there are various references here and there, in the introduction and in the preamble, but these scarcely figure in the action programme, nor are they included in the legislative initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Take, for example, lifelong learning, which is mentioned and which, as an accessory to the success of the new policy for the reform of the labour market, is essential if we want to have a fair and efficient system of ‘flexicurity’. However, there is no grand ambitious programme, something the equivalent, for example, of the old Erasmus scheme, which is not only bearing fruit but has also proved a very effective link via which EU citizens can recognise and acknowledge the work of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to combating social exclusion and poverty, and promoting social protection, the proposals for action are essentially limited to non-legislative initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also regret the absence of any progress on the Working Time Directive and Part-Time Work Directive. Similarly, in the area of taxation, we cannot but note that for want of an initiative on a genuine corporate tax base – which is something that Parliament has been advocating and which the Commissioner concerned was working on – we are still not moving towards a more equitable single market in this particular respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we are impatiently waiting for two initiatives that you announced. The first concerns the review of the European Works Council Directive, which Parliament has been calling for since 2001, and the second, which you mentioned, concerns maternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to conclude by referring to two examples of deadlock that seem to us to be absolutely incomprehensible and unacceptable: they relate firstly to services of general economic interest and secondly to social services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After so many White Papers, Green Papers, announcements, disputes before the Court of Justice and a number of clear and repeated demands from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and even though a consensus was reached between the Member States in the Council on including a new article in the Lisbon Treaty to provide a clear basis for a legislative initiative – in codecision with Parliament – on public services, which are services of general interest, there is still no concrete proposal forthcoming.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Public services lie at the heart of our social model. The people of Europe are waiting for clarification that competition rules and single market rules will not suddenly just be imposed on them. Mr President, you should present an initiative to Parliament on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome many aspects of the Commission programme. In particular, I am delighted to see the Commission’s commitment to bring forward a specific horizontal directive under Article 13 to combat discrimination in access to goods and services, although perhaps I would have preferred to see specific directives in all sectors. However, I do welcome it. This is something I and many other colleagues have been calling for, and I look forward to working with the Commission closely on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also welcome the Commission’s commitment to a communication on hospital-acquired infections. We need to work towards a code of practice at European level to ensure best practice is shared and standards are raised, given the stark differences that exist between Member States. I would also like to see an amendment to the 2000 Biological Agents Directive to protect health workers from contracting HIV and hepatitis C from needle stick injuries. There are over one million such injuries across the EU each year, and I am disappointed that there is no action planned in this 2008 work programme. I would urge the Commission to bring forward that amendment as soon as possible in line with the Parliament’s request.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also say, under health and safety legislation, that I am pleased that you are committed to having impact assessments before any new legislation is brought forward. But I urge you to make sure that you look at the implementation of current legislation as well.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am delighted at the prominence given to energy policy in the Commission's plans. I would nonetheless like to draw attention to the need to achieve a balance between environmental and strategic aims. It is very easy to impose new environmental taxes, and easy to demand better environmental standards for construction and industry, but this will not, however, resolve the problem of our energy security. Political measures aimed at energy solidarity in a crisis are required.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The principles of the common market should be urgently applied to energy proprietors who also control distribution. This is particularly important if the proprietors hail from third countries, such as Russia, where the principle of subsidiarity is not applied in the area of foreign investments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Countries at risk of economic blackmail will be more inclined to bear the cost of environmental programmes if the latter go hand in hand with strategic solutions vital to Europe's energy security. I remain under the impression that we have failed to achieve a balance in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso this morning sounds rather like a bad First World War general: let us do the same thing we did last week, even though it did not work.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is absolutely no recognition that the model simply is not working. I mean, how could he talk about growth and jobs without acknowledging that this wonderful, fabled Lisbon Strategy has been a total disaster? We have not achieved a single one of the objectives. And yet we talk about growth and jobs, but what are we going to do? Are we going to deregulate? Are we going to lift the burden off business? No, nothing of the kind.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wonder how he has got the front to talk about a sustainable Europe when we still have the same common fisheries policy, we are still throwing back, dead, up to 50% of the fish we catch and yet we are going to stick with the quota system.</p>
      <p sl="de">But perhaps my favourite is the idea that this Commission programme is going to put the citizens first. That is laughable! If you wanted to put the citizens first, you would respect their opinions. You would have listened to what the French and Dutch said and you would give them, with this new Treaty, the opportunity, in free and fair and open referendums, to see whether they share with you the same vision for the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">But you are doing none of that. You are burying your heads in the sand. You are pretending it is not happening and you are actually destroying your own European Union because the whole thing falls further into public contempt.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, the members of the EPP-ED Group who are concerned with budgetary matters have essentially been happy to approve the Commission’s plans for 2008, and Mr Barroso has formulated a clear message that reflects political commitment. However, the work programme itself is rather an endless wish-list. If we were to debate the legislative programme and annual political strategy right at the start of the year, drawing them together, then the budget could be shaped to our goals, and not the goals to the budget.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Parliament is committed to the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology and expects the Commission and the Council to make a decision on these matters that serves to benefit European citizens. Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Commission not only serves growth and job creation through many programmes but also uses taxpayers’ money responsibly and demands similar responsibility from the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I approve of the fact that, in the event of serious abuse, the Commission is prepared to suspend payments to the Member State in question. Hopefully, this painful step will not need to be taken but everyone, governments and European citizens, should know that the aim of aid is to develop under-developed regions, and that growth and job creation do not constitute an increase in the bank balances of smooth operators and spongers. The Commission can also count on the strong support and cooperation of Parliament in this area. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am glad that matters relating to growth and employment head the list of the European Commission's priorities for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is evidence of an understanding that full employment and preservation of the wide range of social services characteristic of the European social model cannot be achieved without swift and sustainable growth. Unfortunately, the Commission's document is disappointing because it lacks detail. The situation will not be improved simply by repeated reference to mantras such as 'the knowledge society' and 'flexicurity', whilst the Lisbon Strategy remains largely confined to paper.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Specific and more determined action is required, so as to encourage European societies to be more active on the labour market, remove barriers within the single market, notably in the area of the free movement of labour and services, and create more favourable conditions for entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe is a world leader in terms of social and environmental protection. Europe’s potential for growth is too low, however, and will not enable it to retain its position. Action should focus mainly on developing education, and increasing flexibility and readiness for work. We must move away from a paternalistic social policy that perpetuates inactivity towards a social policy that rewards activity on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The common currency has an important role to play in the creation of economic competition. I welcome the enlargement of the euro zone to include Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta. The discriminatory treatment meted out to certain new Member States endeavouring to join the euro zone should be cause for concern, however. Lithuania is a case in point. Any recurrence of such errors in the future could be detrimental above all for the eurozone.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We trust that the European Commission will present us with specific proposals regarding support for employment and growth, so as to ensure a high and constantly rising standard of living in a united Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the PPE-DE Group is concerned, the objectives for the coming year in the field of the internal market and consumer protection are very clear. Firstly, we want to see the completion of the internal market through the removal of remaining barriers and obstacles. That is why, Mr Kyprianou, we welcome your proposal for a health services directive, based on Article 95, which would adopt a very broad-brush approach to the health sector. We also welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy and his Directorate-General will be looking at further aspects of public procurement as a follow-up to the Services Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we want to see comparable standards of consumer protection being established in all Member States of the European Union and, Mrs Kuneva, we greatly welcome your review of all the relevant EU legislation in this area. We are also pleased that we can act on this review in two directives, firstly in a horizontal instrument and then in a revision directive which will cover all the other areas to be dealt with.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we want to help achieve a situation in which we finally have clearer, simpler and therefore fewer rules in the European Union. I am turning to you now, Mr Verheugen: as Members of this Parliament we will be looking very closely at all the proposals relating to the free movement of goods from this perspective. The Toy Safety Directive will come, as will the Construction Products Directive, and I am sure we will see some movement on tractors and defence goods as well. We hope that we will make tangible progress here. We are also very much looking forward to your anticipated study on consumer labelling.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s policy is Lisbon. The Parliament’s policy is Lisbon, but Lisbon is not happening. We want to know why not, we want to see progress and we want to see that monitoring and enforcement. President Barroso talked about prizes. Let us have the Barroso prize for achievement each year for the Member State that has made most progress. Why not? Give them some encouragement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where we do want progress is on some of the things in the programme. We obviously want it on emissions trading. We do not want to see it slipping any more than the one month he referred to. We want progress on climate change, quite clearly. We want progress both in terms of what we can do through legislative restriction on emissions and so on, but also what we can do to encourage individuals. So let us have the things like eco-labelling proposals coming forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also want some progress on the information to patients – Mr Verheugen’s proposal. We want to see progress on patient mobility and cross-border health. That is urgent. Otherwise, we are going to have lawyers deciding policy for us. We want to see that coming forward along with measures on patient safety, medical professionals’ information, work on hospital-acquired infections, work against the counterfeiting of drugs and so forth. We want to see that mental health proposal which has been promised and has not yet appeared. It was promised for this year. Let us have it please. That is an important step.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, this week we have the very first World Diabetes Day – the UN has supported this, as have Member States, the Council and the Parliament. Let us have a bit of support from the Commission on progress on that as they see the symbol that we are going to erect in the courtyard of this Parliament tomorrow. Let that be a reminder that we want some action to support the many families, and children in particular, who suffer from that debilitating disease.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very pleased to see that climate change remains one of the key priorities of the Commission for the coming year. Here we have an awful lot to deliver and I think we should focus on that delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand why Commissioner Dimas is delaying the publication of the ETS and the other parts of the energy package until the new year, but I hope that does not mean that we are losing our resolve on climate change. There is a certain amount of scepticism in Washington and elsewhere about how serious the European Union is about climate change. It would be a real shame at a time when we are seeing changes in Washington, on both sides, Republican and Democrat, where we are seeing changes in Australia and a willingness to begin dialogue in China and India, if we were to stumble on our reform package on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">We had our summit in March but it is not enough to talk about targets. We have got to implement them. We cannot just ‘talk the talk’ on climate change; we have to ‘walk the walk’ on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">You, as the Commission, cannot do that alone. You need the governments of Europe to back you, and there will be a tough debate on burden-sharing in the new year. I hope this Parliament will be involved in that debate, not just watching on the sidelines, and we look forward to seeing how we can be involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">But you also need the support of this House, and I say to the colleagues opposite and to the Liberals: last month, on cars, you let us down on climate change because you watered down the Commission proposals. There will be another test later this morning on aviation emissions and I hope that we will have a strong package.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Mr Barroso mentioned the committee of wise men or wise people, which Mr Sarkozy wants to set up. Why cannot these wise people – yes I agree they should not be looking at institutional reform – why cannot they look at delivery, that we actually deliver what Europe promises, and then we will begin to make the reconnection with the citizens that is so often talked about.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome very much the emphasis given in the 2008 work programme to the importance of a sustainable European energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Barroso spoke out about the greening of the transport sector and, of course, that is vital. However, to my mind, the really shocking statistic is that in Europe we use 40% of our energy in buildings – in heating, cooling and lighting – even though we have the technology to design and engineer our buildings to have virtually no energy requirements at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I want to make a plea to the Commission to be radical in its review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive next year – point 2(c) of the Strategic Initiatives. Two things are needed. Firstly, the minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings should be tightened. We need to move very quickly to a passive house or ‘zero carbon’ standard, with no net energy requirement. Thousands of passive houses are now being built in Europe but, unfortunately, only in a few countries and regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly and most importantly, we need to get rid of the 1 000 m2 threshold and bring all buildings with a heating or cooling requirement within the scope of the Directive. That would mean all buildings undergoing major renovation would be brought up to high energy standards. We have to look at the energy wasted in existing buildings and not just at new buildings, because 75% of the buildings which exist today will still be standing in 2050.</p>
      <p sl="de">MEPs have been discussing the Commission’s action plan on energy efficiency in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and it seems to me that there is the political will in Parliament for a radical revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. I hope we can count on the Commission to come forward with some strong proposals next year so that we can stop this completely unnecessary wasting of energy in our buildings.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we, too, welcome the Commission’s vigorous efforts, the legislative programme and the work programme. The programme brings out the need to adopt measures in the transport sector that are more environmentally friendly; it highlights the Strategic EU Energy Review, the suppression of biodiversity and the marine environment strategy.</p>
      <p sl="el">We recognise the EU’s major contribution so far to the fight against climate change, about which several Members have already spoken. My only comment with regard to accepting the inevitable period of climate change we will have to undergo is that I disagree. Rather than accept it, we should put pressure on our partners to comply with the Kyoto Protocol and abide by the post-Kyoto commitments to reduce gas emissions. We Europeans should also practise what we are constantly preaching.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Commission also emphasises health and proposes numerous legislative and non-legislative packages. Medical insurance and quality of health services, pharmaceutical products, organ transplants, rare diseases and innovative technologies to fight chronic diseases are among the issues that the Commission intends to include in its programme. The Commission’s targets are very ambitious, but we shall have to wait and see their finer detail.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, I must mention the Health Services Directive. Under what conditions will the free movement of patients and health professionals be permitted? How can we avoid a disproportionate burden on health funds? These are just some of the questions that we will have to consider in connection with this new directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the Commission’s work programme and I look forward with keen interest to hearing how the EU is going to meet its extremely ambitious greenhouse gas emission and energy targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was recently in Washington having meetings with the members of the Congress. They are fascinated to hear about our emissions trading system and are talking about cap and trade but they are rather incredulous about how ambitious our targets are.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also looking forward with keen interest to hearing how we are going to further develop the common research area. As President Barroso is not here, I will forbear from commenting on the European Institute of Technology and move on swiftly to mention the Small Business Act, the Commission communication for small businesses, because there are high expectations in the small business community of this proposal. But I am bound to say that in my Member State it may cause some confusion since a non-legislative action described as an act is possibly something of an oxymoron in UK terms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, the small business sector is vitally important for our economy, for innovation and flexibility, for creating jobs, and it is to be supported. But we do have this habit at European level of being strong on rhetoric and weak on actions in support of small business.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the focus on a sustainable Europe arises, among other things, from our priority to protect the climate. There have been many references today to excessive bureaucracy, over-regulation and the violation of subsidiarity. It has also been made very clear that these arguments are invariably advanced whenever a new rule or law is unwelcome. However, in terms of effective climate protection, it is clear that if we had gone ahead 10 years ago and adopted rules to cut CO2 emissions from vehicles, the European Union would now be in a better position and we would not be under the pressure we are now feeling to bring about the effective climate protection that is required.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also apparent from the European Commission's various assessments that one of our decisions, namely to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, could be attained simply through compliance with legislation which is already on the statute books, and so my question to the Commission is this: what specific steps are being taken to monitor the implementation of existing legislation?</p>
      <p sl="de">I have another question which relates to risk assessment on genetically modified organisms, which is also mentioned in the Commission's work programme. My question is this: what improvements is the Commission trying to make in this area? As we know from many debates, this is also one of the main points of criticism of our work and of legislation in this field.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, the cohesion and regional policies function on the basis of the regulations with which we established a seven-year framework in 2006. A total of EUR 350 billion was earmarked for growth and employment, with priority for the Lisbon objectives, and there was a specific goal in mind.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is all well and good, you may say, but what is missing? I am missing the Fifth Cohesion Report in the plan for next year: it was promised for June 2008. The report must lay the foundations for long-term adjustments to the cohesion policy and for our plans regarding the regions and cities. In our Member States there is a trend towards renationalisation, which Parliament firmly rejects as it covers a whole range of policy areas: R&amp;D, innovation, regional cohesion and rural policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this context, I would like to address Commissioners Hübner and Potočnik. The PPE-DE Group launched the debate on the medium-term approach with a parliamentary hearing last week, quite rightly to look at the question in more depth and to bring the citizens and regions into focus in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the move to make the new Solidarity Fund more flexible, Mr President, has been blocked by the Council, and we would like to see a breakthrough there. As far as the Commission is concerned, much more support is required.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, very briefly, I would like to list what I regard as the most important points arising from this work programme. Undoubtedly a key theme for 2008 is the Health Check for the common agricultural policy. The 2003 CAP reform should be reviewed and simplified, we all agree on that, and to that extent I hope, as rapporteur, that the important contributions that we in Parliament make to this own-initiative report will be taken into account in the ensuing legislative proposal. This Health Check must help us find the right path towards a common agricultural policy for the post-2013 period.</p>
      <p sl="de">A further project is the planned Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality. Quality must become an even greater focus in agriculture, and this applies to farm imports from third countries as well, which must conform to the same standards as those applicable to EU producers.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am particularly keen on an initiative to promote the consumption of fruit in schools. This is something which we in the PPE-DE Group have been championing for some time, and we are gratified that the Commission intends to take up this initiative. Other key issues for 2008 such as the Milk Package, the 2008-2009 Budget Review, the Action Plan on EU Animal Health Strategy and the Review of Support for Less Favoured Areas will certainly make sure that there is no scope for any boredom in Parliament!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the issue of transport and mobility is naturally also viewed as a priority in the programme for 2008. Of course, we have very clear challenges here. We must set priorities in 2008 ranging from economic efficiency, impact on the environment and, not least, the rights of users and their safety: issues which can only be touched on briefly here.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rules on security controls at airports, for example, were introduced in response to pressure from very topical events at the time. In the PPE-DE Group, we consider that the relevant directive could now be reviewed. As to passenger rights, this issue could be dealt with conclusively if we were to focus in more detail on the rights of passengers in international coach travel as well. That would mean that in Europe, passenger rights would be covered in all modes of transport: air travel, rail and road.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards trans-European networks, this is a topic which we have discussed on frequent occasions in recent months. Here, of course, we face a special situation: too little money and a lot of projects, especially now that the Council has announced several new projects in recent weeks. We take the view that on the issue of trans-European networks, clear decisions must be taken in 2008, and that transboundary routes must have absolute priority so that the so-called bottlenecks disappear, allowing effective application of the principle of multimodal transport.</p>
      <p sl="de">A swift decision must and could be reached by taking account of those countries where cofinancing is already envisaged and where the projects have got off to a good start on a technical level.</p>

      <p sl="es">We would also like the Commission to make a start on issuing precise guidelines as to how it intends to apply the maximum sustainable yield model to EU fisheries, particularly multi-species fisheries. We feel it is important for specific legislative proposals to be put forward for eco-labelling of fisheries products since this will have significantly improve the traceability of these products and provide guarantees to prevent the consumption and sale of products obtained from illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, following the Commission’s announcement that it intends to withdraw the draft agreement with Tanzania, I must pass on the request from the sector that it do all it can to continue negotiations with this country: they are vital to provide the tuna fleet with fishing grounds in this area of Africa through a number of agreements with adjoining exclusive economic zones.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we are discussing the programme for 2008, I would like to start by pointing out that we have made major progress in the field of home affairs policy in recent months, and I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Frattini for that. We have Schengen, and this week in plenary we have taken major steps forward with Prüm, the Visa Information System (VIS) and data protection. This is major progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot leave it at that, however. Now it is about the practical work for tomorrow. The key priority for all of us, on a practical basis, is to make major progress with SIS II. In the PPE-DE Group, our main concern is that after the great success of the enlargement of the Schengen area, fatigue will now set in and many Member States will slip into a state of inertia. That is something we cannot afford. We need SIS II as a major project for next year.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the legislative sphere, I would like to touch upon the border security issue again in particular. Here, we must consider whether in future the evaluation of external border protection should no longer be carried out by Schengen members' own evaluation teams but by the Frontex agency. That is where this responsibility should lie.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask the Commission to be brave and, on the proposals regarding migration, to actually define a European added value. If a proposal is submitted for a Blue Card for highly skilled workers, this should not just be a proposal that endorses national rules and applies a common label: it really has to be a European proposal. The same applies to combating terrorism. If a system for the transmission of air passenger records is established, we cannot have 27 individual rules, which we could bring in straight away; we really need a European proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go along with a lot of what President Barroso has said, especially when he says that the Commission is being tough on illegal immigration but very generous and supportive on integration.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can certainly agree to the directive on penalising employers who illegally employ non-Community migrant workers, but we find no trace in the programme of those legislative measures on legal migration previously announced by Vice-President Frattini. No mention is made of the Directives on seasonal workers and highly skilled workers, nor of opening up legal migration channels for unskilled non-Community workers, who constitute the majority of immigrants now present on EU soil. We believe these measures to be necessary, not least so as to combat exploitation and bring undeclared work out into the open.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reference to a shared overall approach is fine, and one cannot fail to agree on the need to avoid having 27 different immigration policies, but we look forward to receiving some more tangible information about the European surveillance system announced in the programme. Finally, Mr President, I would recall that under the new Lisbon Treaty many of these subjects will be handled through codecision as of 1 January 2009, with this House assuming full legislative responsibility alongside the Council and the Commission. It might perhaps be useful to prepare the ground for better cooperation among the EU institutions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, one point I wanted to make was very similar to what Mr Fava has just said about the absence of any major emphasis on the need for an EU policy on legal migration. We have had the proposals from Commissioner Frattini – and all credit to him – but we need great pressure to be put on Member States to respond to those proposals because the challenge of getting a comprehensive and well managed legal migration system for the EU should be up there with the challenge of climate change. It links into so many other issues, economic and social.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should be having a summit of Prime Ministers to look at not only EU competence but also exchanges of best practice on management of migration as well as integration. I must confess I have my doubts about the emphasis that is put by the Commission on the benefits of circular migration. I wonder whether that is going to come unstuck in the same way that our experience with Gastarbeiter did many years ago. I am not sure that it is going to work out. Human beings do not necessarily leave when they envisaged that they would leave.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point is to raise data protection concerns about the envisaged entry-exit scheme and the electronic travel authorisation. I do not know what electronic travel authorisation will add to the visa information system, and I look forward to hearing a great deal more from Commissioner Frattini about these schemes.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements in which 12 new countries acceded to the Union are now behind us. It is now time to focus on the integration of all the citizens of the 27 countries and to set a common course and common challenges for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the points in the Commission's programme is to put the citizens first. With that in mind, future enlargements should be approached with caution and due consideration. Enlargements opposed by the citizens should be avoided. I have in mind Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As Mr Barroso pointed out, we lack a common immigration policy. I trust that the principle adopted will involve controlled immigration, carefully selected, as in the United States. After all, immigration is not simply a response to particular circumstances affecting the labour market or pensions. It involves people with whom we will have to coexist for centuries. We should select individuals who will find integrating into European civilisation a pleasure rather than an imposition.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Europe benefits from its immigrants, but in today’s Europe xenophobia is increasing rather than diminishing. The example of Italy is fresh in our minds. In my country, Greece, an EP delegation recently saw for themselves the wretched conditions in which hundreds of immigrants and asylum seekers are detained on the island of Samos. This was in a detention centre which Ministers promised would be closed immediately, but which is still open, despite a report by an international NGO condemning it for torturing illegal immigrants. Unfortunately, in the present dangerous climate, instead of promoting the positive aspects of immigration, the Commission is responding to a climate of fear artfully created in certain sectors.</p>
      <p sl="el">The problem you have presented us with focuses mainly on policing, and this is somewhat biased. It is necessary, of course, to combat illegal immigration. There is a need for solidarity with countries receiving huge influxes of immigrants. Proper agreements on readmission at European level and the common European protection of immigrants’ fundamental rights are needed. Immigrants cannot be sent back into danger and destitution. Europe needs a serious foreign and economic policy to combat the main causes of migration, such as poverty and war, through peaceful yet tough measures. Above all, of course, a multilateral policy is needed to integrate migrants into our societies.</p>
      <p sl="el">Instead of this, your programme equates immigration with criminality. Commissioners, you are specifically stating that the European border control system, a programme that is integrated into the framework of immigration policies, will increase the internal security of the Schengen area by preventing illegal immigration, terrorism, etc. What does security have to do with immigration, or indeed with illegal immigration? What does it have to do with terrorism? By associating these bogeys with immigration in the public imagination and in Europe’s policies, I fear you are playing the game of the EU’s far-right forces.</p>
      <p sl="el">Please eliminate these dangerous attitudes from your strategy documents. There are undoubtedly criminal immigrants, just as there are English, German and Greek criminals, but the immigrants’ only real crime is that they were born in poor or war-torn regions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of budgetary control, the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008 is a disappointment because key issues and problems relating to budgetary control simply do not feature in the programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">It could be argued that this is about current management, but our concern is this: if we look at the past few years of 'current management', it is clear that in order to solve the problems, the Commission really should have adopted an agenda which went beyond current management.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are unlikely to make any progress on the statement of assurance, although the Commission should be bringing substantial pressure to bear on the Member States here. You have our support on this issue, yet we do not see you doing this. As a result, you are very likely to fall short of your own commitments: commitments which the Commission President himself undertook personally on behalf of this Commission. He pledged to move forward towards a positive statement of assurance. We are at least as far from achieving this now as in all the years before, as we have known since yesterday evening.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to implementing the commitments, what we believe is lacking is a serious approach. The same applies, incidentally, to the Commission's legislative programme itself. You should be world champions in practical implementation, not in planning! Of the 200 items for codification announced for 2007, just 23 have actually been submitted to Parliament to date, and only six of the 43 announced new items have been tabled so far.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question which arises is this: why are we even talking about this programme if you will not be putting it into practice? You really need to do better in 2008.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I wish to express my thanks to the Commission. A work programme is not just a declaration of principles, but a tool to implement specific policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">The humblest bid to implement, however, can be a gem, and I feel the real gems in this work programme are initiatives that place the European citizens centre stage: initiatives concerning, for example, patient safety, quality of health services or reconciliation of family and professional life, as Mr Barroso said in his speech here. We would have liked to have had this in writing in the same detail as part of the work programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">Perhaps the greatest gem of all, though, is the proposal for a directive to combat discrimination in all the Member States. We need this directive in this Year of Equal Opportunities for All because it must show that discrimination is not just a social, moral and political error, but also a waste of human resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Reform Treaty states that the EU must encourage not only social cohesion but also non-discrimination. Consequently, the right directives are needed because all European countries must have the same levels of protection against discrimination. There cannot be a discrimination hierarchy. A Europe that tolerates any kind of discrimination cannot purport to be an example to anyone.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do have one problem here, however, and that is the role of the European Parliament in this issue. All we have is its opinion, and it is rather ironic that we are encouraging equality here yet when it comes to institutions all of them are equal but some are more equal than others.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also regret that the introduction to this work programme makes little mention of, or reference to, discrimination against, and integration of, immigrants. We call on the Commission to keep the promise it made to this House that EU action will cover all areas of discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Barroso’s slogan is ‘delivering results for Europe’, but these results must also be in the area of intangible business, not only in the market.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Barroso’s Commission was to become the champion of citizens’ freedoms and rights. That has been very disappointing up until now, but with less than two years to go perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel. As far as I am concerned, the highlight of the 2008 work programme is the proposal for a directive on equality outside the workplace, that is, a general prohibition of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At last the Commission is listening to what Parliament has been calling for over the last number of years. Priority must be given to this matter. However, the Commission must guarantee better compliance with the existing legislation because there is a discrepancy between the excellent anti-discrimination laws we already have and the Commission’s inability to actually enforce them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The anti-discrimination principle must also be introduced in other areas, such as inheritance taxes and wills, and the Commission must recognise modern family set-ups in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also welcome the proposals to reinforce equality between men and women, for example by reconciling work and family life.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As regards the position of women in the labour market, the proposals for more flexibility are important. Flexibility is, as it happens, good for women. Rigid rules for the protection of employees put women at a disadvantage.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Intercultural dialogue has been highlighted as a priority. The intention is to get rid of social tensions by means of dialogue, but in reality this is often inter-religious dialogue and I therefore object to it, Commissioner. There is nothing concrete in the proposals for the coming year, and it is therefore not clear what the intercultural dialogue will be, but I fear that it might be the annual photograph of Mr Barroso with the generally conservative ecclesiastical leaders.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the following issues. First, as regards the multiannual strategy to establish an area of freedom security and justice: the draft Reform Treaty foresees the respect for the rights of persons belonging to minorities. I believe that now we really need a common European policy on minority rights and social inclusion – the recent events in Italy demonstrated this clearly. Speaking about putting the citizens first, I am sure that we have to return again to the concept of civic citizenship, which includes all permanent residents of the EU. Mr Frattini, the Commission should take a stand on this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a kind of irony in the Commission claiming that it wants to put the citizen at the centre of the European project in its 2008 legislative programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the citizen, the poor lowly citizen, has never before been central to the concerns of the Brussels-Frankfurt-Luxembourg triangle, where practically all the powers will be concentrated from now on, in other words in the hands of institutions that do not even respect the fundamental principles of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How, therefore, can we claim that we are promoting the welfare of our citizens in the era of globalisation when in fact we are in the process of abandoning the principle of the republic, which is government of the people, by the people, for the people?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Caring for the citizen means respecting what he has to say. In this regard, the Lisbon Treaty is an insult to the people of our nations, because it is just a copy and paste job of the European Constitution that was overwhelmingly rejected and because it confirms the logic of the current Treaties that prohibit us from controlling the euro, from safeguarding our markets, from protecting our borders from illegal immigration and from defending ourselves in international trade negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In particular – and these remarks are intended especially for my French colleagues in all the parliamentary groups – this Lisbon Treaty does not change the dogmatic concept of competition without balances, without national interests, without frontiers and without any concern for democracy. Its Charter of Fundamental Rights, which takes precedence over the rights of individual Member States, sweeps away the notion of the Citizen of the Republic as laid down in our Constitution and replaces it with the most dangerous form of multiculturalism. As for the Citizen of Europe, no one has ever met him: in fact he does not exist.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the perspective of the PPE-DE Group in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to make the following three points.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we very much welcome the fact that the European Commission has included a proposal for a European Company Statute in its legislative programme for next year. This is something which this House has wanted for a very long time, and so it is very welcome indeed. What we find regrettable is that the Commission has, in effect, been forced into this course of action after we made use of the legal instrument of Article 192 and opted to present a legislative own-initiative report, despite the fact that the Commission has been aware of this problem for a very long time. Indeed, it has been mentioned repeatedly in a whole series of company law programmes ever since the days of Commissioner Bolkestein.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we find it most regrettable that this year, the Commission suspended the process for the adoption of the Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of limited companies. This is indeed a major problem. We expect the Commission to reconsider and include it in future legislative programmes. If this does not happen, may I make it clear here and now that we will again make use of Article 192 and force the Commission to bring forward a relevant legislative proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commissioner's notions that for the application of the Merger Directive, it would first be necessary to set up a company in another country in order to merge with it are bureaucratic and absurd. This is not a solution that we regard as acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">With a view to the next legislative term, at least, we would also like to see the Commission giving some thought to achieving progress in relation to copyright and perhaps commissioning a Green Paper on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we are obviously extremely pleased that citizens are at the forefront of the European project, but I must point out that one of the EU’s major problems is the general public’s vast lack of knowledge of what the Union is. I think any of us who give talks, teach or speak on the subject witness this phenomenon.</p>
      <p sl="es">Only the other day the media in my country referred to your colleague Mrs Ferrero-Waldner as the Swiss Commissioner. Having said this, what we need, year after year, is a specific and broad awareness campaign to bring the European project closer to citizens and to gradually raise awareness of the institutions and how they operate.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also ask the Commission for a more accurate definition and smoother communication with this House and the Committee on Culture and Education in relation to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008, since the website clearly has some major limitations.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it is true that 2008 will be an important year, as the President of the Commission said, but it will be a year of transition prior to the end of this Commission’s mandate.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think if we can draw one conclusion, it is that the Durão Barroso Commission, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which it was forced to handle EU affairs, was clearly equal to the task, both internally – the work programme – and in terms of its external image.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my capacity as group coordinator in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am worried about a number of future international events such as the election of the next President of the United States and the repercussions of this on conflicts in central Asia, talks with a new Russian President, development of the Neighbourhood Policy and accession negotiations, assistance in the event of a statute for Kosovo, the result of the Annapolis Conference in the Middle East, the elections we all wish to see in Pakistan, the Olympic Games in China after the Communist Party Congress and the next EU-Latin America Summit in Peru.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, Madam Vice-President, please ask the President of the Commission to reiterate our praise of the Commissioners responsible for external relations. I see that only Mr Rehn is here today and I also wish to extend my congratulations to Mr Mandelson, Mr Michel and, of course, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.</p>
      <p sl="es">The most important thing here is for the EU’s external action to be visible and effective, and I would ask you, Madam Vice-President, to exercise extreme caution when applying the provisions of the new Treaty so as not to compromise EU achievements and successes in foreign policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, most EU citizens agree that the Union must play a larger role on the world stage. The Council should play a larger role in this regard, but it is often paralysed or inefficient as a result of internal disagreements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission will hopefully set a good example this coming year, starting in Europe. In Turkey the negotiations must proceed smoothly and care must be taken to see that they stay on the right track. There is much work to do in the Balkans: Bosnia needs help to start forming a state and Macedonia needs to prepare for the start of membership negotiations. In addition, of course, the European Union will hopefully make an important contribution to the rebuilding of Kosovo and with any luck by the end of this year or some time next year a solution will have been found to the question of its status.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We very much want the Commission, however, to continue with the Black Sea initiative it has undertaken. It is very important for the European Union to strive for regional cooperation around its borders. What will the Commission do in terms of the Central Asia strategy that was recently approved by the European Council?</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this respect, I also wish to ask if we may expect further development of the energy policy that Parliament requested earlier this year. This is very important, including with regard to relations with the region I called ‘zonet’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Then there is the European Neighbourhood Policy. I think that the priority this coming year must be to conclude the negotiations with Ukraine: in this respect we hope – and Parliament will discuss this tomorrow afternoon – that a situation can be created in that country that will allow, over the coming years, for a new type of agreement, a form of association, under which Ukraine can continue the reform process with the new government towards further integration with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In that process Moldova must not be forgotten either, as it is in need of a new partnership agreement. I hope that the Commission will also present proposals on that issue next year.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Naturally we must also look at how to handle a country like Georgia: this is something we will also debate tomorrow afternoon and we would ask the Commission to be proactive in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to my regret I have to say that I am disappointed with the section of your legislative and work programme on Europe as a world player.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is of course little legislation in the field of external relations, as we all know, but there is all the more work to be done for that and I find that what has been written on the subject, with a couple of exceptions, is in fact grossly inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is obviously also difficulty in clearly identifying Europe’s fundamental problem when it comes to foreign policy. The text glibly states that Europe is a world leader in the fight against poverty, the promotion of sustainable development, human rights and governance, and so on and so forth. That may well be, but it is not perceived as such by the rest of the world, certainly not by the EU Member States, and I hear very many complaints that it is not so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is true, however, is that the European Union is the largest provider of all these things that are listed. Reflecting this in our image as a world leader, as a body that takes the lead on the global stage, is something else entirely.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am encouraged by the positive direction of the programme’s proposals concerning Africa. I feel, for example, that the proposal to establish trilateral discussions between the EU, Africa and China is particularly hopeful and positive. I also think that the proposals to make greater efforts to promote economic development in Africa is just as important. We are thus moving in the right direction, although there are still not enough specific goals.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the year 2008 will differ from the current year in that it will not bring a further enlargement of the Union. The coming year will, however, provide an opportunity to develop economic and political relations between the Union and a number of important countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and also for instance in the South Caucasus, as previous speakers have already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must keep two Union priorities in mind. Firstly, participation in peaceful stabilisation, notably in the Middle East and South Asia. Secondly, exerting pressure on all our partners to ensure that the development of our bilateral relations in the areas of economics and politics is linked to respect for human rights. This applies to each and every one of our partners, regardless of whether the particular country concerned is a poor African or Asian one, powerful Russia or fast-developing China. These two areas, the political and economic on the one hand and human rights on the other, cannot be torn asunder and dealt with separately.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, 'Europe as a world partner' is a very nice heading for the Commission programme, but what we are really talking about is the European Union, not Europe, and it is presumptuous to use this heading at all, for Europe is far greater than just the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU wishes to present itself as a world partner, and the Commission's programme is very honest about this: it talks about a foreign policy to project, promote and protect – and therefore assert – Europe's interests and values successfully. How is that supposed to happen? The answer, increasingly, is by using military means! The European Union is now a military actor all over the world. On paper, this is to provide assistance to people, but in practice, EU interests, or the interests of EU Member States, are being asserted by military means. Congo is a good example. The EU's military intervention there has ensured that Joseph Kabila, an autocrat who is acceptable to the EU, is now in power, backed by elections, and his opponent has been forced into exile. A brutal war has erupted in Eastern Congo, with some 350 000 people forced to flee their homes.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU's military intervention in Chad, too, has primarily served to bolster the position of military ruler Idriss Déby, an old friend of France. This type of EU military operation is simply a continuation of Member States' neo-colonial policies. It seems that it is difficult to voice unadorned criticism of political friends. Pakistan is a case in point at present. The basis for all of this is the Reform Treaty, which makes a clearly militarised EU policy possible. The next issue is Kosovo, and we are seeing what can happen there. Individual Member States have already announced that they intend to recognise Kosovo on a unilateral basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">I urge the Commission to reject such measures unequivocally and not to condone any unilateral recognition of Kosovo.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at the risk of upsetting Commissioner Dimas again, I will repeat some of the words I said last night. Only legislate, Commission, please, where it is needed in the new work programme. Enforce the regulations that we already have in place and enforce them right across the European Union. Do not bring in policies which actually discriminate against industry, business, opportunities within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Barroso mentioned something very close to my heart on the Committee on International Trade, and that is trade defence instruments. Use them where it is necessary to protect the health and safety of consumers in the European Union but do not use them as a protectionist measure. We live in, as he quite rightly said, a global economy, and I look forward to seeing that.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to Commissioner Mandelson, I wish him well in the WTO Doha Agreement and I hope that we can move agriculture forward with the US and the European Union to ensure we get a settlement, building on things like Euromed, which are very important to the European Union. We have agreements with Morocco and we must look at these sort of situations. The US has just put in a free trade agreement on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally on EPAs: just over a month ago, Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson was standing strong on his commitment to conclude EPA negotiations by December. Let us hope that he has relaxed his position and will move forward on that.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the context and constraints affecting the Commission in the field of foreign policy, and so we are grateful for the efforts it has made, for example, to ensure that aid continues to reach the Palestinian people after the dramatic turn taken by events following the legislative elections. On this subject, we would suggest to the Commission that it prepare as of now for possible future scenarios, whether the Annapolis conference is a success - as we hope it will be - or a failure.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the neighbourhood policy, as has already been said, we would quite frankly have expected more than the brief progress report given in the text of the programme. A debate has begun on the future of our Mediterranean policy - I do not know whether President Sarkozy will choose to broach this topic in his speech today - and the Commission should without doubt undertake a more detailed assessment of these policies. It should also make proposals for the future, involving this House rather more than it has done in the past, given that tomorrow we are to discuss Parliament's report on the neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, we would urge greater consistency between internal EU policies - such as agriculture, fisheries, trade and immigration - and our development cooperation policies with the poorest countries, especially in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, the reference to Latin America strikes us as very weak. We would honestly expect relations between the European Union and this major continent to feature more prominently on Europe's agenda, given that Latin America is so crucial to decisions on the environment as well as to other policies such as trade and energy. Those, then, are the main points I wished to highlight on behalf of my Group.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am speaking here as our group coordinator in the Committee on Development. It will therefore not surprise you that I wish to congratulate the Commission on emphasising prosperity, solidarity, security, freedom and strengthening Europe in the world.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All these things are directly relevant to the situation in poor countries. Poverty, war and instability in developing countries have a direct impact on our continent. Showing solidarity and support for poor countries is not only in the interest of these countries but in the interest of Europe itself. It is only by cooperating with poor countries that adequate solutions to problems such as migration, energy and climate change can be found. Indeed, as the Commissioner says, a comprehensive and coherent approach is needed at once.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is precisely in this context that it is so important for Europe and Africa to work together towards a joint EU-Africa strategy for Africa’s development. This will be defined at the Africa summit in Lisbon in December. I hope that it will be a good example of a new way of cooperating.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As regards the effectiveness of our policy, I firmly believe in the importance of quality control and impact assessment, and the need to cut red tape. I hope that in this way Parliament and the Commission can work well together and that the Commission will therefore keep us apprised of the situation in a regular and timely fashion, as indeed it should.</p>

    <intervention id="2-070" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Margot Wallström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should first like to express my thanks to all of you for your comments, whether detailed or general, whether critical or supportive of the Commission’s proposal for the work programme for next year. The scope of this discussion illustrates also the scope of all the tasks and missions and activities of the European institutions. It ranges from comments on fisheries policy or fishing agreements with Tanzania to the peace process in the Middle East – the whole range of activities that we are engaged in.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think also that this debate underlines that the overall objectives that the Barroso Commission has set itself remain valid and urgent. It has to do with prosperity, security, solidarity and – in everything we do – the role of the European Union on the global scene. This also came out very clearly in the last statements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have now followed this procedure and engaged with the European Parliament, in the committees and also here in plenary. I think we can say that the way this procedure has improved has also improved the quality of our proposal for a new legislative and work programme. I appreciate also that all my fellow Commissioners have visited their committees; I think that we have appreciated this highly in some of the details that we have been able to add or change in this process. I hope that we can continue to make it even more political, and your comments have shown that we are here to discuss the political content and the overall balance. It also comes out clearly that the various political groups might have different views on this overall balance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to comment on the content in relation to four or five particular issues. First of all these issues come back almost every week on the agenda of the European Commission. To start with the Lisbon Process and the growth in jobs: I think, for the first time, we are getting very visible results. It is not correct to say that this is a total failure and that we cannot see improvements. We have created a clearer focus for the Lisbon Agenda. We have created more of a political ownership and we have a kind of scoreboard where we make country-specific recommendations – positive or negative comments on what each and every Member State does. This continues to be the way forward: more focus, more political ownership, higher visibility of the actions. This is a long-term goal, a long-term objective of the European Union, but we have to continue to put pressure on Member States to deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another area concerns social issues and the social agenda which, judging by their comments, is of concern especially to the PSE Group in Parliament. Here, we also had some specific questions on services of general interest. The Commission has long recognised the importance of services of general interest and we have had years of debate on this particular issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are very pleased that the Treaty of Lisbon and the Protocol on services of general interest have been agreed. Next week, and as part of our review of the internal market, the Commission will adopt a communication outlining how we will deal with services of general interest. I hope that Parliament will study our communication very seriously, together with its accompanying documents explaining how and when state aid rules apply to these services of general interest, and also how public procurement rules apply.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear in saying that the Commission does not want to close the debate. It wants the debate to focus on the problems at stake so that we can also concentrate our efforts on providing concrete solutions. So this discussion will continue and we hope for the contribution of Parliament in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other big issue where I thank you for your detailed comments has to do with energy.</p>
      <a text="(The President interrupted the speaker to call for quiet in the Chamber.)"/>
      <p sl="en">I will not be able to go into all the details that have been mentioned in this debate; I am sure that the dialogue will continue in the relevant committees and the European Parliament as well. Just to repeat what is in our proposal: in the energy package are four different initiatives. You have touched upon that because it is a policy paper concentrating on the internal energy market, on security of supply and technological developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">There will be a revision of the Oil Stocks Directive. There will be a complete review of the Directive on the energy performance of buildings; this was a particular question during this debate. There will also be a review of the Energy Taxation Directive, as taxation can be used to favour environmentally-friendly consumption.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next issue that we find constantly at the top of our political agenda, not only in the European Commission but I am sure also in this House and in all governments around Europe, is of course migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Barroso explained very clearly how we address this issue. I can assure you that almost every week, thanks to our colleague Mr Frattini, we find this issue on the Commission’s agenda, with discussions on stream and proposals on stream to address the issue of migration. You know that the policy on legal migration will not be represented next year because we have already adopted a number of proposals on legal migration, so this is not the main focus for next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there will be two priority initiatives in 2008: there will be a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers and there will also be a directive on the entry, the temporary stay and residence of intracorporate transfers and remunerated trainees. That is what you can expect in this particular area.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the principal position of the Commission on these issues, I would just refer you to what President Barroso said in the debate. Therefore, you will find that these issues remain at the top of our agenda for next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the external front – because you also mentioned the whole range of external issues and the activities and events where the European Union is expected to participate and play an important role – we have three strategic initiatives for next year. We have a strategy paper on enlargement; we have a series of reports on the progress made in the European Neighbourhood Policy – since many of you mentioned that – and we also have a communication on concrete follow-up measures to the EU-Africa strategy. Therefore, we will have ample opportunities to discuss the external issues during next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can tell you, since this is the second Commission mandate on my part, that I see much more focus – and this has been mentioned in the debate – on implementation. We have a daily struggle to make sure that we focus on implementation, and a legal act is only as good as its implementation. This is where we will continue to focus.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can also tell you that it is not true that we are not reaching out. If we look at the latest Eurobarometer figures, they have never been so positive towards the concrete results that we have been able to deliver. When the debate in the European Parliament and the concrete delivery become visible and the results become visible to the citizens, that is when we will also see our democratic legitimacy increased, and that is what we have to focus on.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also add a citizens’ summary to our proposals for next year. Before the end of this year we will present a new internet strategy, since some of you have asked for this. At the beginning of next year we will also come with a new audiovisual strategy. It is important that we focus together on a number of communication priorities, and you will see proposals for interinstitutional communication priorities in our work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, next year is the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which will be launched under the Slovenian Presidency at the beginning of January. There will be a prelaunch in December, with participation from the European Parliament, and we expect the active involvement of the European Parliament throughout the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank you again for this debate. If some issues about which you feel strongly are missing from the legislative and work programme, that does not mean that they have been put aside: the Commission will continue to provide monthly planning updates, including initiatives that have not been highlighted or initiatives which become necessary to respond to unforeseen events.</p>
      <p sl="en">The dialogue between you, in the European Parliament, and the Commission does not stop today: we will continue working together in the positive spirit that has characterised this whole exercise and procedure and our shared ambition expressed in the work programme. I see that we diverge less than we converge and that we have a similar view on the overall objectives and priorities for the year 2008. I also hope that your motion for a resolution will endorse it and we will provide an excellent basis for continued cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Nassauer’s speech verged on equating the volume of legislation with the amount of bureaucracy. This is, to put it mildly, simplistic. European legislation that creates a single set of common rules for the common market – instead of 27 contradictory and divergent rules – makes life easier for businesses and cuts bureaucracy. Legislation which protects public health or the environment may cost money in the short run but saves far more in the long run.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we all want to avoid unnecessary red rape and bureaucracy, but to give the impression that all legislation is unwelcome because it inevitably causes bureaucracy is ridiculous.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I welcome the European Commission’s work programme for 2008, which defines the future of the Union and the next steps in its development. I feel it is important to emphasise that the document must contain not only principles but also specific recommendations, in the interests of essential action in European politics, especially in the area of social policy. The emergence of ever-increasing immigration in recent years is a big challenge for all the countries of the EU. There are not yet any adequate answers for dealing with the social and economic problems related to this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I agree that the working papers include an integrated approach to migration and press for appropriate management of the movement of labour that is essential for economic development. Europe needs immigrant labour, but in spite of this they are regularly affected by discrimination and various atrocities. We cannot renounce the fundamental requirements of humanity and benevolence in our European migration policy. Reception programmes for refugees must include the employment, training and full integration of immigrants into European society at a human level, and above all the fight against xenophobia and racism.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Legal migration must be supported, and at the same time effective action needs to be taken against illegal immigration and human trafficking. It would be necessary to prepare a common European refugee policy in order to achieve all this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Better, more comprehensible legislation, applied consistently, is necessary for this, and for the Union to win the confidence of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the Commission's presentation of its work programme for 2008. I believe its approach to the challenges currently faced by the EU, such as the volatility in financial markets, combating climate change and ensuring energy security underlines that the EU can achieve together what no one Member State could achieve in isolation. Only by providing leadership and deliver results in these areas can the EU be assured of its citizens continued confidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would sound a note of caution about the Commission's approach in two particular areas: I believe that moves to develop an EU-wide tax base are misplaced. Taxation policy remains an exclusive competence of Member States and the proposed CCCTB, despite contentions from its proponents, seeks to undermine Member States' competence in this area. I believe this will lead to tax harmonisation by default and I would be completely opposed to such a move. Such divisive initiatives only serve to create divisions between Member States and undermine citizens' confidence in the European project.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I believe that it is critical that the Commission strikes the correct balance in the forthcoming "health check" on the CAP and the parallel debate in relation to the EU's budget.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the convergence of television, telecommunications and the internet the television has become an interactive medium and TV viewers have become ‘actors’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The viewer can now research content, select programmes and react to broadcasts; however, to do this requires an ever growing number of devices.

      <p sl="fr">I thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so now, at a time when, after some apparent hesitation, Europe is pulling itself together and starting to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I thank you for allowing me to reiterate before you France’s commitment to Europe and to state clearly that the ‘no’ vote to the European Constitution was not an expression of the French people turning its back on Europe; rather it was an expression of their expectation of greater things from Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">From the outset European integration has been carried along by hope. Now – and this is a responsibility that we all bear – the people expect Europe to deliver on that hope. Hope for peace, hope for fraternity, hope for progress. This hope was born of the great tragedies of the 20th century. This hope was born of the blood and tears of millions of men, women and children. This hope was born of immense suffering. It is the hope that never again will the people of Europe wage war on one another, that never again on European soil will we see attempts to conquer, dominate and exterminate, which led our nations to the verge of material and moral destruction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European idea came about because one day great Europeans reached out to each other over the borders, borders for which so many people had died. And the people who had suffered so very much followed them, deciding that hatred was a thing of the past and friendship was now what was needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European integration was possible because our people were horrified at what they had done. They refused to fight any more because they knew in their heart of hearts that a new war would be fatal. Instead they chose to love each another, to understand each another, to work together to forge a common destiny.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European integration must be seen for what it is: a moral necessity, a political necessity, a spiritual necessity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European integration is the expression of a desire shared by the peoples of Europe who recognise values, who recognise a common civilisation and who want to keep those values and that civilisation alive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe cannot be just a machine. Europe cannot be an administrative machine. Europe cannot be a legal machine that churns out standards, regulations and directives, a machine of procedures and rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe cannot be kept separate from real life, separate from feelings, separate from human passions. Europe cannot be a reality and has no possibility of existing unless, for millions of men and women, irrespective of their beliefs, it is something that is alive, something that speaks to them, something that gives them the hope of a better life and a better world. Europe will either be a great ideal, or it will cease to exist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When the people say ‘no’, we cannot say that they are wrong; we have to ask why they said ‘no’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all know – and I voted ‘yes’ by the way – that the French ‘no’ vote and the Dutch ‘no’ vote unfortunately represented much more than a rejection of a text, important as it was.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all know that this ‘no’ vote was the most visible manifestation of a deep-seated crisis of trust, which cannot be ignored and which must be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All those who love Europe must take this ‘no’ from two of the founding peoples, two peoples who have always supported Europe, very seriously indeed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This ‘no’ expressed deep-felt anxiety: millions of men and women had begun to lose faith in Europe. Why? Because they had the feeling that Europe was no longer giving them sufficient protection. Because they had the feeling that Europe had become indifferent to the difficulties they faced in their lives. Whether or not this feeling is unfair is irrelevant. I am convinced that millions of men and women, in all our countries, share that feeling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This ‘no’ was a disaster. It plunged Europe into the most serious crisis of its history. But that crisis, which could have been the undoing of Europe, could also be good for it by encouraging those who were staunchly committed to the European cause to think about the reasons for the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, what has been achieved in Europe is remarkable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of us here are the representatives of people who hated one another, who sought to destroy one another, and some who waged war on one another for centuries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the outset, Paul-Henri Spaak, the great European, President of the first European Parliamentary Assembly, uttered the universal and eternal words: ‘Let us not forget anything, for that would be a profanation, but we have decided to embark upon a great adventure which, if it succeeds, will allow us to save what we have in common and what we hold most dear’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For half a century this great adventure has continued in spite of countless difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The parliamentary assemblies have played a decisive role. And allow me to pay tribute to all those who participated in them because they represented the citizens of Europe in all their diversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That diversity, I believe, is something that we should not fear. That diversity is something that we should respect; it is our greatest asset. Democracy means debate. It means a plurality of opinions. It is the opposite of a system where everyone is forced to think the same thing. Europe would die if we all had to think in the same way and if those who thought differently were seen as bad Europeans. There is no such thing as bad Europeans. There is just Europe, and everyone should be allowed to be part of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe in exchanges, I believe in discussion. That is why I have always preferred majority rule to unanimity. And that is no small commitment for a French President.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unanimity is the system that allows a few to impose their will on everyone else. Unanimity is the certainty that no great or bold decisions will ever be made, that no risks will ever be taken, because with unanimity we have to fall into step with those who want the least from Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unanimity means powerlessness. Unanimity means that it is impossible to act. It means that it is impossible to go back on what has been decided and that is why I supported the extension of majority voting in the simplified Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe in democracy. I believe that Europe must be as democratic as possible. That is why I have always believed that we were doing Europe no favours by rejecting debate, by stifling criticism, by concealing our differences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that Europe needs more debate, more democracy and, at the end of the day, more politics.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has managed to break this deadlock because at the Brussels summit the Heads of State or Government, aware that they had Europe’s fate in their hands, took a political decision. On that day in Brussels the political will of the different Heads of State or Government swept away all of the obstacles that had up to then seemed insurmountable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What did politics mean? It meant acknowledging the failure of the draft Constitution. It meant proposing to the French who voted ‘no’ to negotiate a simplified Treaty to end the deadlock in Europe and have it ratified in Parliament, as I had stated during my presidential campaign. The French people authorised me to allow the simplified Treaty to be ratified in Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Let me add that it is strange to say that the European Parliament is the place where the democratic heart of Europe beats, and yet you say at the same time that parliamentary ratification in France would not be democratic: if Europe is democratic in the European Parliament, France is democratic in the French Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Politics for the countries that had ratified it, and I want to pay tribute to them and the parliamentarians here who had supported the draft Constitution, meant agreeing to open negotiations on a new, less ambitious text. We managed to end the deadlock in Europe because the countries that had voted ‘no’ made an effort. I want to pay tribute to those of you here who were in favour of the Constitution and who agreed to discuss a new draft. Europe has emerged from the crisis because there was goodwill on two fronts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The simplified Treaty is a political victory for Europe. It is a victory of the European awareness expressed through politics.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now – and I accept my responsibilities – it would be a mistake to think that with the simplified Treaty we have solved everything in Europe, that we can rest easy and that there will be no more questions. The simplified Treaty resolves the institutional crisis, but the simplified Treaty does not resolve either the political crisis or the moral crisis in Europe. It enables Europe to take decisions and to act. But it does not say to what end and for what purpose. It does not tell us what Europe will look like tomorrow and how it will help to improve our citizens’ lives. It does not provide those who had stopped believing in Europe with any reasons to renew their faith in it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The institutional question has been resolved. Now we have to resolve the political questions. We must examine them without fear and debate them without any taboos.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has chosen democracy and in a democracy we must be able to debate anything and everything: budgetary policy, trade policy, monetary policy, industrial policy, fiscal policy, all policies, whatever they are. Otherwise, there is no point in saying that we want a democratic Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has chosen democracy and in a democracy independence can never be confused with a complete lack of responsibility. Nobody should be able to cite their own independence as a reason why they should not have to be accountable, explain themselves or be subject to scrutiny. In a democracy political responsibility is a universal and fundamental principle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In European democracy we should be able to discuss Europe’s aims and objectives. I have proposed the creation of a committee of wise men to reflect upon the future. I also believe that we should be able to discuss together the different potential futures for Europe: there are different paths available to us and I wonder how we are going to be able to choose the right one if we refuse outright to discuss them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In European democracy we should be able to debate European identity and national identities. We should be able to discuss how Europe is building its identity and, excuse me, defending it. We should be able to discuss how Europe protects its national identities, which are one of Europe’s assets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should not be afraid of these identities. Wanting to preserve one’s identity is not a sickness. It is when identities are under threat, when they feel under attack that hackles rise and they become dangerous and aggressive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The peoples of Europe are experiencing an extremely deep identity crisis. It is a crisis that affects both our nations and the idea of civilisation that is shared by all Europeans and that unites Europe. It is a crisis that is linked to globalisation and the commercialisation of the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Launching Europe through economics, through coal and steel, through trade was a stroke of genius by the founding fathers. But the politics have been too slow in relation to the economy, and slower still in relation to culture. It was a mistake to have overlooked the cultural Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">In a world threatened by standardisation, in a world dominated by technology, where economic values tend to take priority over all others, Europe cannot be Europe in the eyes of all men if it does not defend values, values of civilisation, spiritual values, if it does not do everything in its power to defend cultural diversity. But what will we defend, as far as diversity is concerned, if we have not preserved our identities?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe must ensure that it is not seen as a threat to identities, but as a form of protection, a way of keeping them alive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On a moral level, too, human rights are part of the European identity. Throughout the world every time a human being is oppressed, every time a person is persecuted, every time a child is abused, every time a people is exploited, Europe must stand by them because the Europe of human rights is true to its word. It is up to Europe to spread human rights to all regions of the world.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Let me add that all those who have in the past refused to defend human rights to get contracts have lost the contracts and have lost in terms of values.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">In European democracy the word protection should not be outlawed. If we do not want our peoples, fed up with being the victims of unfair competition and dumping, one day to call for protectionism and the closure of borders, we must have the courage to debate what should be a genuine Community preference. We should be able to do as much to protect ourselves as others do. We should be able to equip ourselves with the same instruments as others have. If the other regions of the world have the right to protect themselves against dumping, why shouldn’t Europe? If all countries have exchange policies, why shouldn’t Europe? If other nations can reserve part of their public procurement markets for their SMEs, why shouldn’t Europe? If other nations implement industrial policies, why shouldn’t Europe? If other nations defend their farmers, why shouldn’t Europe defend its own farmers?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Europe does not want protectionism but Europe must demand reciprocity Europe does not want protectionism but Europe has the duty to ensure its energy and food independence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe wants to lead by example in the fight against global warming but Europe cannot accept unfair competition from countries that do not impose any ecological constraints on their own companies.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Europe is committed to competition but Europe cannot be alone in the world in making it a creed. That is why at the Brussels summit it was decided that for Europe competition was a means rather than an end in and of itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has opted for a market economy and capitalism but that does not mean absolute laissez-faire and financial capitalism that favours speculators and shareholders to the detriment of entrepreneurs and workers.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">European capitalism has always been a capitalism of entrepreneurs, a capitalism of production rather than a capitalism of speculation and market trading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, I am stating loud and clear that Europe has a role to play in injecting some much-needed ethics into financial capitalism, and what we saw with the crisis in the subprime market – where a few speculators are undermining global competition – is something that Europe cannot accept.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">We have different ideas and different points of view on all of these issues, but that does not mean we should not discuss them. We must debate them until we have succeeded in reaching a compromise that allows us to build a common policy. All of these issues will be at the heart of the priorities of the French Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are many more subjects to debate: the recasting of the common agricultural policy, ecological taxation, renewable energies and energy saving, defence. How can Europe be independent and have a political influence on the world stage? How can Europe be a factor for peace and stability if it is unable to guarantee its own security?</p>
      <p sl="fr">What does our commitment to Europe mean if we are unable to discuss the establishment of a European defence system and the renewal of the Atlantic Alliance? What does our commitment to Europe mean if each and every one of us is unable to make an effort to ensure the defence of all?</p>
      <p sl="fr">From the ECSC Treaty to the simplified Treaty the people of Europe have built up solidarity. We can see this in the regional policy, but we should also be able to see it in defence. We should be able to see it in a European immigration policy. In a Europe where people can move freely between the Member States, this policy can only be a common immigration policy. You cannot be a member of the Schengen area and regularise without informing the other countries because regularisation in one country has an impact on all the others in the Schengen area.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">When I was elected President of the Republic I set myself the priority of putting France back at the heart of European integration. I wanted France to overcome its doubts by getting more involved in Europe. I know full well that France will not be able to get its own way on every issue but I want France to recover its place at the heart of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have re-established a dialogue with the Community institutions and I want to thank President Barroso for the relationship of trust that has been established between France and the European Commission. France’s policy now is to work closely and with complete confidence with the European institutions, that is to say, the European Parliament and the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will do my utmost to see to it that everyone feels that this vision is their own, to see to it that the United Kingdom ratifies the simplified Treaty, because Europe needs the United Kingdom …</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I will do my utmost to engage in dialogue with the countries of the East, countries that often felt justifiably that they were not being listened to sufficiently. It is not because history has condemned peoples of Europe to join Europe later that they have less rights. They have the same rights as the founding countries. That is the European spirit.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I did in proposing the Mediterranean Union. I do not want anyone to be excluded and I want to build on the work done in Barcelona. If Barcelona had been enough, we would know that. We therefore need to be ambitious yet again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want France to breathe dynamism into Europe because if things are going well in France, all of Europe can benefit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nobody in Europe has any interest in a weak France that is unable to grow. Nobody in Europe has any interest in a France in decline, a France suffering from an identity crisis or a France that is afraid of the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have undertaken a programme of reforms. It is not in Europe’s interest for these reforms to fail because they will enable France to put its public finances in order and to fulfil its commitments. The French people have approved these reforms. I made my case to them prior to the elections. That is why I will see to it that these reforms are implemented in full. Nothing will prevent me from achieving this objective and it is the best thing that France can do for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, in this city of Strasbourg, so dear to the people of France and irrevocably linked in the minds of all Europeans to your Assembly, your Parliament, which keeps democratic debate so alive, here at this podium where she spoke so often, I remember Simone Veil, who in 1979 was the first President of the first directly-elected European Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to pay tribute to her contribution to the European cause and her contribution to the cause of women. She fought for respect for their rights, for respect for their dignity, and your Parliament has always been faithful to her principles. Simone Veil said: ‘Whatever our differences, I think that we share the same desire to create a community founded on a common inheritance and a shared respect for fundamental human values. It is in this spirit that I invite you to undertake the tasks that await us, in a spirit of comradeship’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I make these words my own. These words are challenges. These challenges are the challenges that our citizens expect Europe to take on. We must not waste any time. Europe has already wasted so much time in the last ten years. We must waste no time in ensuring that the people recover their faith in Europe once more. You can count on France’s unfailing commitment to Europe.</p>

These are widespread problems, however, which are rooted in socio-political developments in post-communist countries. The general public is irked by the anonymity and indifference of capitalism and resorts instead to familiar and tried and tested networks.</p>
      <p sl="de">This proves, yet again, that social transformation cannot be imposed from outside: something that the US is trying to achieve with its wars of aggression, while the EU dangles the prospect of 'accession'.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to refer to Mrs Kudrycka's report on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas. This is particularly important for relations between Poland and Ukraine, two countries and peoples that have been bound together by historical ties throughout the centuries. The essential action required to introduce significantly easier visa procedures for our Ukrainian friends should be taken as soon as possible, notably where young people, students, academics and seasonal workers are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the longer term, we should aim at the introduction of a visa-free travel regime. This is particularly important in terms of laying the foundations for Ukraine's integration into the European Union in the future. The Union must support the development of democracy in Ukraine, assist in the creation of civil society and facilitate contact between our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas is to be signed in parallel with the readmission agreement as these are ‘mutually conditional’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As indicated, these agreements form part of the EU’s fight against ‘illegal immigration’ and its instruments. The report expressly accepts the ‘recommendations as to need for providing adequate technical and financial support for Ukraine by the EC and the European Commission in particular, in achieving high level of implementation of readmission agreement’. However, we are critical in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Despite the agreement introducing strict procedural deadlines, setting preferential visa fees, including a full visa fee waiver for certain ‘categories of persons’ (?), and providing for a simplified procedure in a number of cases, this is less than what has been demanded and what is required by thousands of Ukrainian citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What the rapporteurs have failed to realise is that there is a need for the effective implementation of measures aimed at facilitating issuance of visas to broader sections of Ukrainian society, or even a non-discriminatory visa exemption regime such as Ukraine provides for citizens of the various EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore voted accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="de">For far too long, the EU has given a helping hand to countries around the globe while failing to make these monies conditional on the readmission of illegal immigrants. This has exacerbated the flood of illegal economic refugees pouring into destination countries without any education or prospects for the future. This has occurred in tandem with various visa scandals, in which countless people have entered the EU in the guise of tourists and promptly vanished into the EU's low-wage sector, thus destroying jobs on a massive scale. It is high time that readmission arrangements were made a fixed element of agreements. The opportunities to vanish into the anonymity of our conurbations must also be removed at all cost.</p>
      <p sl="de">The growing trend towards the establishment of visa centres – which are then closed down due to a lack of applications – must also be treated with caution. This practice must under no circumstances lead to a situation in which visas are issued arbitrarily simply to avoid such closure.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I would like to take the opportunity offered by this debate to register my disappointment at the way in which digital television is developing in Malta.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Certain basic principles need to be respected.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Firstly, Maltese consumers should have the right to continue watching national stations that are free to view without being charged.</p>
      <p sl="mt">In practice, all digital television service providers should broadcast these stations free of charge. In addition, anyone who does not buy a digital receiver from these companies should still have the right to receive the signal from these stations.</p>
      <p sl="mt">My second point relates to the interoperability of different platforms in Malta’s case, digital terrestrial and cable. The lack of interoperability in the Maltese system is leading to less choice for consumers because when they wish to make use of the services of another company, they must install a different receiver.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I hope that the updated policy of the authorities competent in this matter will address these problems.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr Weber has tabled a very interesting report on what is currently a controversial issue. In the present digital environment, services, networks and business systems have undergone significant changes, and a wide choice is now available to consumers. Interoperability has therefore become a fundamental concept for information and telecommunications networks.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree that users' needs should be of paramount importance in market development. Accordingly, it is important to focus on viewers and on enabling them to make fully informed choices, so that they really are in a position to benefit from the full potential of new technology.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The interoperability debate mainly concerns broadening the choice offered to consumers in the area of interactive television services. This choice largely involves the services offered by operators rather than the equipment, however, especially as the choice can take various forms, and subscribers are able to choose between different platforms depending on the content and services available.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with the rapporteur that it is advisable to continue promoting the open standards developed by European Union standards bodies in relation to the switchover to digital and the interoperability of services, and to further this action by promoting European digital television standards in other parts of the world.</p>

I am in favour of investment in quality sports facilities and appropriate measures to allow access to sports premises and sports curricula at school to all students including those with disabilities. In this way we will ensure that every student can participate in a variety of sports.

      <p sl="nl">It goes without saying that I think sports teachers should be treated in the same way as other teachers.</p>

      <p sl="en">We chose to vote against the statements in paragraphs 10, 24 and 47.

      <p sl="pt">As stated in the report, full attention must be paid to sport due to its social and cultural aspects and due to the social and educational values that it transmits, such as self-discipline, challenging personal limitations, solidarity, healthy competition, respect for opponents, social inclusion, opposition to any form of discrimination, team spirit and tolerance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Accordingly, in our multicultural society, sport can and should be an integral part of formal and informal education, given that studies have shown that regular physical activity improves mental and physical wellbeing, while having a beneficial effect on learning abilities.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this report because it deals with a matter that is particularly important for the health of a whole generation of young Europeans, and therefore for their lives as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Increased marginalisation of physical education within the school curriculum means that the time allocated to physical education in schools in EU Member States is gradually being eroded. The financing of school sports buildings and facilities is far from adequate. In addition, essential equipment for the conduct of physical education classes is in poor condition. There are also concerns regarding the quality of the training undergone by physical education teachers. The overall picture hardly inspires confidence. That is why we should support the European Parliament's initiative aimed at reversing the present situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is to be hoped that the positive effects of this initiative will make themselves felt after just a few years. Providing for more sport in schools is not just part of the effort to obtain better results in competitions and future Olympic Games. It is also a way of ensuring that this generation of young Europeans will be notably healthier, fitter and not overweight, as is so often the case today. I know what I am talking about, because in my country, Poland, the number of children and young people who are obese or overweight is increasing at an alarming rate.

These are also values that have to be introduced into the family circle, for this is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, in view of the twin threat that we are now facing, namely the public health problem generated by the prevalence of obesity among our young people and the social problem that is typified by an education system based on personalised choice, the European Union and the twenty-seven Member States have to react and rethink the relationship between sport and education.</p>

The negative trend of unhealthy lifestyles among young people appears to be increasing from year to year. Mr Schmitt’s report therefore touches on a pressing and important subject.

It is difficult to see why the EU in particular should regulate in detail the number of hours of physical education at school, not only for primary school pupils but also for secondary school pupils. Nor can I see any reason for Brussels to micromanage physical education, with demands for mixed gender groups and special sex education. The last paragraph, which aims to set up a special system of commendation for various types of voluntary work, looks particularly strange, not because dedicated Europeans do not deserve appreciation, but because it is difficult to see how such a thing would be structured, administered and financed.</p>

For far too long PE has been a minor subject, particularly in primary schools, and lessons are often cancelled at the first whiff of rain.

      <p sl="pt">It is well-known that soil has a basic social function as it is essential for the production of food and other agricultural crops and the storing and transformation of energy and minerals, in addition to functioning as a natural filter for groundwater, the main source of drinking water, the habitat for a variety of organisms living in and on the soil, the platform for human activity and an important element of landscape and cultural heritage. It is therefore a key component of the earth’s environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are already several Community policies aimed at protecting these essential functions, although not the soil itself. As the Commission’s impact assessment demonstrates that soil degradation is worsening, concern is increasing about protecting the soil, linked also to concerns about climate change, safeguarding sufficient and clean water, protecting biodiversity and fighting against desertification and deforestation. More Community legislation specifically aimed at protecting the soil itself should result in the exchange of information and coordination between Member States, without adding any unnecessary administrative burden or calling into question agricultural production and the social function of soil.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission’s proposal on soil protection is generalised and vague. It makes no provision for Community funding or for basic, essential projects for the prevention and replacement of degraded soils.</p>
      <p sl="en">Particularly in the Mediterranean countries and Greece, the problems are more acute because of the warm, dry climate, geographical relief, strong winds, etc., which contribute to desertification and soil erosion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the coastlines, which are long in relation to these countries’ total area, favour salinification and the redeployment of land use for housing development. The lack of a soil map and thematic maps results in excessive use of agricultural chemicals. In practice, there is also an inability to promote crop rotation, because of the misconceived CAP pricing and subsidy system for agricultural produce.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Protection of the environment is a politically important issue in Europe which has developed rapidly in recent years and in which research continues to be a priority for the Union. However, the environment cannot be protected in Europe without protecting the soil which is exposed to various degradation processes. The need for specific protection measures within a new European framework in this area therefore makes total sense.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We recognise that, in the main, soil is in private ownership, but also that soil is a natural resource of public interest and therefore must be preserved for the benefit of future generations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Multi-faceted protection of the soil is one of the main challenges for environmental protection at international level. It also has a tremendous impact on the economies of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I wish to express my concern about the consequences of natural degradation of the soil and degradation caused by human activity. Degradation of the soil is often the result of inappropriate human activity in the areas of agriculture and forestry. It can also be a consequence of industry, tourism, and urban development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to point out to the House that compliance with the provisions of the directive will make it possible for degraded land to be reclassified, thus preventing the use of green field sites for industrial and commercial purposes. The directive will also provide for soil to be classified in terms of its potential for plant and animal production, with particular reference to the production of high quality food.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to highlight the need to develop a European strategy aimed at identifying and resolving issues relating to soil degradation. Due to the great variety of soil types, a European strategy is required, independently of national action. Such a European strategy would be based on prevention, and would aim to raise public awareness and to persuade the public of the need for soil protection. In addition, the strategy would identify risk areas with a view to resolving this problem at European level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be noted that it is important to establish a clear demarcation between this directive and other European legislative standards relating to soil protection in order to avoid regulatory duplication.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Current European legislation does not appear to prevent degradation of the soil. At the same time, soil protection is closely linked to the main international challenges in the area of protection of the natural environment. I therefore believe that there is a clear need to develop Community legislation aimed at protecting the soil as such.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in my view, the inclusion of aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading is a step towards meeting the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol, that is correct.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, may I recall what Mr Sarkozy has just said. He said that Europe must demand reciprocity, and there is none, or far too little, of that here. Emission trading should not begin before 2012 at the earliest. As is the case for small cars, exemptions must be in place for small aircraft under 20 tonnes in order to avoid any disproportionality.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Parliament decided outside the scope of the Kyoto Protocol to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading. Although aviation's share of overall greenhouse gas emissions is only about 3%, in 15 years the aviation sector’s emissions have doubled. Today Europe has confirmed yet again its leadership in combating climate change. However, we need to strike a balance. It is only right that a proportion of allowances be allocated by auction rather than distributed free of charge, which will promote the development of young societies. Auction revenues should be used to develop technologies to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector and not for other purposes.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is well known that another strategy for reducing emissions is the integrated management of flight schedules. I am strongly in favour of a single starting date for both intercontinental and internal flights. The Commission has to persuade third countries to join by the end of 2011. I consider this a necessary condition for fair competition between all European airlines regardless of the company’s address. The goal of reducing global warming by two degrees by the year 2020 involves convincing the rest of the world first of all. The international conference in Bali will soon show how successful we are in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the purpose of the report, which is to include European aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading, a number of questions arise. What is beyond question, however, is that we have clear indications that this is not a particularly successful scheme, and although the Commission has data showing that it is not successful, we are now about to include aviation in the scheme as well. That is my main point of criticism and it prompted me not to vote for the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">By including European aviation in the scheme, we are approaching this as an isolated solution. However, that is the very point which ultimately jeopardises the competitiveness of European airline companies and, alongside these companies, the competitiveness of European airports as well. To my mind, this is not acceptable and we must do all we can to identify global solutions which include other airlines and other airports too. That is the only way to achieve a solution which is good for the environment but is also good for competition in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I start from the position that aviation is also necessary from the point of view of the environment because, for example, in the MIPS survey its benefits are clearly visible. Another basic consideration is that the aim must ultimately be emissions-free air traffic. That is why I am so in favour of channelling revenue into research and development in the area of aviation. If we really see the dramatic increase in emissions from air traffic as a problem, we need to spend all our available resources on ensuring that research money goes into the development of emissions-free air traffic. I hope that in the future the Council will bear this in mind. I also want to say that what Mr Lehtinen just said is my sentiment exactly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I also welcome the fact that Parliament has accepted the possibility that part of the funds resulting from the emissions-quota bidding scheme might be used to reduce the negative impact of this project on the accessibility and competitiveness of the outermost regions.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we all know that it is important to ensure that environmental protection is in place and to fight against climate change. Our actions have to remain within the bounds of common sense, however, and we, as decision-makers, should view things as a whole. In my opinion, the majority on Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have not viewed the matter in all of its aspects with regard to this report. Emissions from aviation account for just 2% of total emissions and so they should be dealt with in proportion to the whole. That is to say, even if our entire aviation service were to cease, this would have barely any effect on global warming. We also have to realise that many airlines have already invested significantly in improving the environmental friendliness of their fleets.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I voted in favour of Amendments 77, 81 and 82, to allow air traffic to continue to survive in Europe’s remotest regions. I do not see the point of having air traffic structured mainly around just a few large airports. Competitiveness between national airlines should not be short-sightedly impaired to the cost of the cut-price carriers. I therefore agree with what Mr Lehtinen said in his speech.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am absolutely delighted to be here today before this House, on behalf of the Presidency and the Portuguese Republic, to discuss the imminent enlargement of the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Only a year ago dark clouds were hanging over Europe with the risk of an extremely serious political crisis due to the technical impossibility of bringing the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS) into operation in 2007. Indefinitely postponing the satisfaction of the reasonable expectations of free movement of citizens from the Member States which joined the European Union in 2004 would not only have been an intolerable demonstration of technological incapacity but also, in particular, a heavy defeat for the European ideal and evidence of the impotence and incompetence of our institutions and Member States. We could have given these citizens a thousand explanations but all would have sounded like feeble excuses and would have invited a search for the guilty parties, thereby preventing the practical solution of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fortunately, we took another route with a speed and cohesion that was truly without precedent. First of all, we found in Lisbon the appropriate technological response to the technological crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">SISone4all was a project conceived in around 30 days with its feasibility study being scrutinised by top European experts within a similar timescale. In December 2006 the JHA Council was able to green light the start of the process with a schedule of operations worthy of a European version of the film ‘Mission Impossible’ and with a minuscule budget, little more than half a million euros. In March, as promised, the software application – a clone of the Portuguese N.SIS (National SIS) – was ready and was delivered to the new project partners. The C.SIS (Central SIS) also underwent a major upgrade thanks to the total commitment of the French Republic, which we must thank.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The German Presidency drove forward the appropriate legal measures with impeccable timing. On 31 August we managed to finish installing the applications and migrating the data which was a difficult and complex process. The next day, the security forces of the new Member States gained access to the new tools which they then started to use with great success. It only remained to check whether all the other many measures needed for admission into the Schengen area had been adopted with equal success, such as those relating to land and sea borders, police cooperation, data protection and issue of visas. Fortunately, these have been adopted. Last week, on 8 November, the JHA Council learnt that the Member States in question have demonstrated a sufficient degree of preparation in order to satisfactorily apply both the provisions not relating to the SIS and the provisions relating to the Schengen Information System of the Schengen acquis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to thank, here in this House, everyone who implemented the changes and carried out the assessment programme in recent months. Particular mention should be made of the important work carried out by the many experts involved in the visits which enabled the transformations achieved in just a few months to be confirmed without a shadow of a doubt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We now have, at what will be the new external border of our European Union, some of the most sophisticated and modern equipment, organisational solutions which deserve prizes for innovation and appropriate procedures for ensuring a very high level in the fight against crime. These will be supplemented by special policing measures, already agreed on a bilateral or multilateral level, so that, in the ‘day after’ the abolition of controls, there is more freedom but no less security.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must also stress that the concern for maximum transparency led the Portuguese Presidency to take very successful steps so that the European Parliament could access the information resulting from the enormous effort made. This House was therefore able to verify the absolute rigour of the impact assessment summary which we also wanted to provide as a separate document. I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on his total commitment to meeting the deadlines set and on the excellent quality of his report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the method we need to use in order to overcome the future challenge of setting up and managing, in an integrated manner, the SIS II, VIS (Visa Information System) and new information systems on travellers which Vice-President Frattini recently announced. No one should have any illusions as mega-projects of this kind can be huge successes or heavy failures. Success can only be achieved with strong command structures, determined leadership and very tight schedules.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We do not need a technology tsar but rather a great deal of work in a democratic network involving the Commission, Member States and the European Parliament, as was demonstrated in exemplary fashion in this case. I should also like to officially thank all those who contributed to this success. This is the secret of the success of SISone4all and only in this way can we save resources, create synergies between projects and in particular, ladies and gentlemen, meet deadlines.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is only one requirement to be met before the Council can take a decision, which is planned for December 2007, on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the new Member States. This requirement is your vote, the vote of the European Parliament. I hope I can count on its result and be confident in this respect, given the very positive content of the motion for a resolution which is already on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Please allow me, finally, to give warm thanks for the very complimentary comments which, through this motion for a resolution, the European Parliament has made to the Presidency and the Portuguese Republic. On behalf of the men and women who in recent months have dedicated themselves to our task of preparing for this historic decision which will finally bury the Iron Curtain, I must say that we were not inspired only by a desire for victory and to avoid a serious crisis. We mobilised the best know-how in Europe, we took advantage of the tools of the new digital Europe to quickly discuss our plans and difficulties and we created a fantastic network of experts and a 24/7 help desk to find solutions. All of this was accompanied by close and unprecedented liaison between experts and politicians, the ministers in this area who periodically met in special meetings to direct the process with the total solidarity of the Commission. I must particularly highlight the role of Vice-President Frattini.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also never forget, ladies and gentlemen, that Europe has its parliamentary representatives, whose opinion must have a bearing on what we do. We took due note of your recommendations and we are counting on your representation at the commemorative ceremonies to mark the historic enlargement of the European area of free movement, which will take place on 21 and 22 November. Thank you, too, ladies and gentlemen, for your contribution to this historic result.</p>

    <intervention id="2-203" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate all the Member States on their achievements in making it possible for citizens in Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, Malta and in the current Schengen countries to finally fully benefit from the free movement of persons, which is one of the pillars of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a real benefit for the citizens of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004. It will make travelling quicker and easier. For all the Member States of the European Union, this shows the benefit of acting together in the European framework. An area without internal border control is an amazing achievement, without historical precedent. From 21 December onwards, travel will be possible from, for example, the Iberian Peninsula to the Baltic States and from Greece to Finland without border checks. This is truly symbolic of a united Europe and a basic right for all European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you are all aware, this historic achievement follows much preparation. Joining the Schengen area is not an easy undertaking. It is a challenge, and we must strike the right balance between freedom and security. Lifting internal border controls is also a question of trust between Member States. It is through a peer evaluation process, the ‘Schengen Evaluation’, that Member States gain confidence in each other’s capacity to guard the external borders on behalf of all the others and issue visas valid for the whole Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States will also improve police cooperation and security controls within the broader Schengen space, in order to prevent criminals from enjoying free movement and better opportunities to act illegally. All this would not have been possible without financial solidarity. The Schengen Facility, providing nearly EUR 1 billion, enabled the new Member States to meet, in particular, the challenge of building up an efficient border control and becoming full partners in the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the European Parliament for their positive support in reaching this fundamental achievement, and last, but not least, I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency. I congratulate you personally, and Ministers of the Interior, Minister Costa and Minister Pereira, on your strategic partnership and clarity of purpose for the successful implementation of the Schengen information system project, known as ‘SIS One For All’. We have worked hard, together with the former German and the future Slovenian Presidencies, to support our Portuguese colleagues, and we have succeeded. This shows what can be accomplished if everyone is fully committed to a complex project. Now, ladies and gentlemen, work is not finished. Our ultimate goal is to make Schengen Information System II fully operational by December 2008. We will again have to work very hard together.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Schengen area is one of the greatest successes in the history of European integration. Abolishing internal borders and implementing several compensatory measures, such as the reinforcement of controls at the external borders, police and judicial cooperation and the creation of the Schengen Information System, are the best way to enable freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Like the European Union, Schengen has grown. From the five original Member States, we are now 15, including two non-Community countries, Iceland and Norway, and with the partial participation of Ireland and the United Kingdom. We are now facing an historic event: the biggest enlargement in Schengen’s history, with the simultaneous abolition of internal borders with nine Member States: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Malta. This is an event full of significance for Europe, for free movement and for these new Member States and their citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must start by welcoming and congratulating them. I want to congratulate them not only on their entry into this area but also, in particular, on the systematic and committed effort that they have made to meet all the requirements laid down by the strict Schengen rules. The December 2006 reports, already mentioned by Minister Magalhães, highlighted various problems which have in the main been overcome. The evaluation teams were composed of experts from all the Member States. They went to the borders and consulates and prepared exhaustive reports containing factual descriptions, assessments and recommendations, many of which required additional measures and follow-up visits due to the problems that still existed in the vast majority of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I want to congratulate the evaluation team, led by Dr Carlos Moreira, not only for the exacting work carried out in a short space of time, but also because it did not just fulfil its inspection role, it also frequently suggested measures and solutions allowing the problems identified to be solved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the absence of internal borders not only requires better controls at the external borders and a good exchange of information and data through the Schengen Information System (SIS), it is notably an exercise in mutual trust in which everyone must strictly comply with the adopted rules. Guaranteeing effective control at our borders allows the security of all European citizens to be ensured. In fact, the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and efficiency that each Member State applies to controls at its external borders and also on the quality and rapidity of the exchange of information via the SIS. Any weakness or incorrect working of any of these elements is liable to jeopardise the security of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why the remaining minor problems must be ironed out. Although they do not constitute an obstacle to abolishing the internal borders, they must be solved. That is why the European Parliament, in the political resolution to be adopted, which has been co-signed by five political groups, and in the legislative resolution, asks to be informed in detail within six months about all pending issues. That is why we also ask that a global evaluation of the functioning of the Schengen area is carried out within two years, involving all the Member States, both new and old.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I want to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its commitment and spirit of cooperation, in particular the Portuguese Government and the Portuguese Secretary of State, José Magalhães, who is here today, and for the solution found with SISone4all, as already underlined by Vice-President Frattini. This solution has enabled the new Member States to be connected to the SIS. If this had not occurred, given the delay with SIS II, it would not have been possible to extend the Schengen area this year. Minister Magalhães, I am fully aware of your extensive personal commitment and I also want to congratulate Dr Eduarda Peixeiro, to whom much is owed for the solution adopted.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I have two final comments. The first is to the European Commission. I would like to remind it once again that the creation of SIS II continues to be a priority for the European Parliament, not necessarily to allow the new Member States to access the system, as this has been solved with SISone4all, but mainly because, within the Community framework, it will enable more efficient use of data, thereby improving security through both the inclusion of biometric data and the interlinking of alerts. My second comment is to the Council. I must express my regret that at the start of this consultation process it did not respect the principle of reasonable cooperation with Parliament as it refused to send the evaluation reports prepared by the experts, on security grounds. Although a compromise was found to resolve the situation temporarily, a long-term solution must be sought. It is absurd to deny Parliament material with which it exercises its legislative competences.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we have taken another step towards European integration. It is up to all of us to make sure that this step results in more freedom and greater security.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European People’s Party and European Democrats Group I would like to welcome the introduction of the Schengen system, and to use the occasion on behalf of the nine new Member States to thank both the German and Portuguese Presidencies, the Council, the Commission and especially Mr Coelho for the enormous amount of work needed to achieve this. I must also mention the efforts of the new Member States, since their work has enabled us to be at this point today.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The free movement of people is one of the four freedoms of the Union. We are now extending this achievement, this new area of freedom to many millions of new Union citizens. This is a joint act by all of us: we Europeans have created this together, and we should be proud of it.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I come from a town on the border of Austria and Hungary. For many decades my town, Sopron, was separated from its immediate environment and from Austria by an iron curtain. I have brought in a piece of this iron curtain to Parliament – as I have many other times. It was this iron curtain that made it impossible to exercise freedom in Europe. With the introduction of the Schengen system, we are eliminating the last remnants of it. This piece of iron should remind us that our recent past did not have freedom, and that we should never allow freedom to be taken away from us.</p>
      <p sl="hu">With freedom comes responsibility. The new Member States are taking on the responsibility of guarding the common European external borders rigorously, since the security of all of us depends on this. Furthermore, we must not allow ourselves to undermine widespread social support for the right to move freely. For this reason every citizen of the Union must comply with the laws of the Union; as Commissioner Frattini said just now, freedom of movement does not mean freedom of crime without borders.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Freedom must not and cannot be abused, because that endangers freedom itself and the right to move freely. Nor can we allow certain forces to revitalise the principle of collective guilt, which brings bad memories, so as to undermine the right to move freely. We cannot allow the perpetrators of crimes to go unpunished. For this very reason, I would like to express my thanks again that the Schengen system can be extended to these nine new Member States. This is an historical event.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, on behalf of my group I, too, would like to congratulate the citizens of the nine new Member States on the present that the Portuguese Presidency will be giving them on 21 and 22 December. I am in complete agreement with the Minister and the Presidency, who are indeed dismantling the last remains of the Iron Curtain. The free movement of citizens without internal borders is a very positive thing and one of the most important freedoms of the European Union, and I welcome the fact that the inhabitants of the nine new Member States will now be able to enjoy it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Schengen Agreement, however, concerns more than just the removal of internal borders. It also means that the external borders of the Union must now be monitored by these new countries, in the interest of all the other Member States. It is very important that the expansion of the Schengen area does not jeopardise our security. Mr Frattini and the Minister have both said the same. Efficient and effective border controls are therefore essential.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The assessment of the Council and the Commission show that the nine countries are in principle ready to take on this task, but that improvements could be made in a number of areas, for example as regards staffing and airport infrastructure, and our curiosity has been aroused as to the evaluations and monitoring that will appear as a result. We hope, too, that Parliament will be swiftly informed about this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Schengen of course relates to much more than border controls. It implies greater police and judicial cooperation between Schengen countries. We are glad that in the case of these nine Member States the Portuguese Presidency has found a solution with a sort of SIS 1+, although we maintain that progress must be made as soon as possible on SIS II. I am happy with Mr Frattini’s promise to have it by December 2008, and naturally we will hold him to that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We understand that Bulgaria and Romania still have to wait a number of years, but we also hope that these countries will continue to work hard, with our help, so that in a few years they can also join the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The same applies to Cyprus. It is a shame that the problem that has been holding the country back for so long is now also preventing it from joining the Schengen area. That is another argument for working together to find a solution to the problem that has affected this country for too long already. In other areas, too, for example in relations with Turkey, this question leads to problems. Naturally a solution is also necessary for the people of Cyprus themselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I want to refer again to yesterday’s discussion. It has rightly been indicated that the enlargement of the Schengen area and the entire Schengen system requires mutual solidarity between the Member States. As I have already said, controlling the external borders is a task that affects all our security and in which the nine countries concerned are now involved. We will now speak to them about this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That security and the need for cooperation are themselves potential future problems, as regards internal migration for example. We must also agree that we will not try to solve the problems unilaterally, but that we will seek to cooperate, with all the countries that belong to the Schengen area working together to solve the problems that arise in the future. As I said, we must ensure that what is currently happening in Italy does not happen, i.e. that one country tries to solve on its own what is in fact a shared problem.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would also like to join the congratulators. I congratulate the new Schengen members for having succeeded in the feat of satisfying the requirements of the Schengen rules in such a short space of time.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also like to congratulate Portugal, which is a double congratulation. Portugal was the first to come up with the proposal of “SIS I for All”. Now, under its Presidency, Portugal has had the ability and energy to drive through the evaluation process.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have heard here what an historic step forward this is. To reunite Europe also in this form, with free movement, is an achievement which cannot be overestimated.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The road has been difficult. In particular, the problem with SIS II, which has been delayed for reasons which are unacceptable and have been much criticised by Parliament. As we have heard, we need SIS II in order to strengthen security within the new enlarged area.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Parliament has also been critical of not immediately having had full transparency and access to the evaluation documents. I would like to give special thanks to my friend and colleague Mr Coelho. Without his efforts we would not have been able to complete our parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like to recall that many of the new Member States have long historical ties to their European neighbours. We must now ensure that the Schengen enlargement does not lead to a Schengen iron curtain against these. These, our neighbours, must also have access to the knowledge we have here if they are to be able to follow in our footsteps and build up a society governed by the rule of law, democracy and a market economy. Once again, congratulations to all three parties that have succeeded here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the Portuguese Presidency on being able to create an agreement and understanding with regard to the enlargement of Schengen, and indeed it is historic. It ranks there alongside the enlargement of the European Union and it is one that we should welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are concerns, however, as rightly mentioned by other colleagues, with regard to our external borders and what we can do and how we can deal with them, about the issue of solidarity and about showing solidarity with other Member States. In particular, from my own position coming from Ireland, because of the common travel area which exists between Ireland and Britain, there are certain difficulties with regard to Ireland becoming part of the Schengen Agreement, for no other reason, maybe, except the most important one of all: that it would reintroduce a border between the north and south of Ireland. So there is a difficulty there but we do not want to see hindered the progress that is being made. Now, with your permission, I would like to continue in Irish.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The EU will continue to grapple with the problems of drug imports into the EU and illicit trafficking in children, as well as addressing itself to common policy on migration, common asylum policy, EU-wide police cooperation, and the fight against organised crime.

We are also worried about the use of sensitive data by SIS II. The data protection regime applicable to these SIS II rules is unduly complex. Will we have a political agreement on the third pillar data protection framework decision by the end of this year? Will the framework decision solve all the problems? Do data protection authorities have adequate resources to enforce data protection rules in respect of SIS II? Will all Member States act in good faith when processing Schengen data?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, on behalf of my Group, believe that today is a very important day because we are extending the possibility of free movement for many Community citizens.

It is a great achievement, pointing us in the direction of a single European space.</p>
      <p sl="it">My Group is nevertheless somewhat hesitant about certain other aspects, especially concerning the external dimension of the Schengen area. We are in fact strengthening the external dimension of the Schengen area, reinforcing and in a sense actually militarising our external borders. We have grave doubts about this: while guaranteeing ever greater freedom of movement for Community citizens belonging to the Schengen area, we are at the same time impeding access for non-Community citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason we are not happy with the entire process. Furthermore, we have our doubts about the implementation of SIS II: we are very concerned, and believe that in certain cases these exchanges of information do not afford proper protection for sensitive data. We therefore think that a very tangible step forward has been taken today in the building of the European Union, yet at the same time we have sent out a very negative signal about the form and substance of this European Union.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to speak on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In previous weeks it has become clear in the media that since the accession of Romania to the European Union, 500 000 Romanians have already moved to Italy. There is therefore a great deal of free movement of people within the European Union even without the application of the Schengen acquis .</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am therefore very concerned about the controls on undesirable persons crossing our internal borders. Italy’s decision to turn away European citizens is an extreme measure that clearly shows that open borders can also have negative consequences. Specific controls will therefore be necessary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is possible at the borders, but controls can also be carried out at airports and railway stations. For this reason it is necessary for a functional SIS to be operational in the short term. Can the Commission, in its Schengen assessment, also focus on the free movement of people from countries that belong to the Union but not to the Schengen area?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we too are pleased that the Iron Curtain which the Communists drew across Europe for more than half a century, with such contempt for human dignity, is finally down. I say this as an Austrian, for whom access to our neighbours, the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians and Slovenians, is now open again, just as it was a hundred years ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I nonetheless voice a point of criticism: on a decision of such gravity, the fact that the Schengen Information System is functioning properly is by no means enough. In my view, the new guardians of the external borders must actually have the capacities to perform their role.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we consider that some EU countries in East Central Europe were still major transit countries in 2006 and that the figures for the apprehension of illegal immigrants were far higher at the EU's previous Schengen borders in Austria and Germany than at the EU's external borders, we cannot afford to ignore this concern. Nonetheless, it is a very good thing that the Iron Curtain has finally been consigned to history.</p>

      <p sl="sk">believe that the new Member States, including the Slovak Republic, are all well prepared to join the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Slovak Republic has fulfilled the individual criteria in the area of Schengen cooperation and has therefore fulfilled all the basic conditions, so that Slovak citizens will be able to enjoy the removal of internal border controls on the ground from December 2007 and from March 2008 in the air as well. The Slovak Republic implemented the Schengen acquis in regard to the Schengen Information System by 1 September 2007 and police information is now flowing through the system in both directions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We have built a network of points of contact to facilitate the exchange of data from police information systems. Our border protection and control are now in compliance with requirements of the Schengen border code. The shortcomings identified in personal data protection and at Bratislava airport have been remedied.</p>
      <p sl="sk">After three and a half years of EU membership, there are no longer any obstacles to Slovak citizens at last getting the right to which they are entitled under the EC Treaty, the right to the free movement of persons.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I myself represent Lower Bavaria, which borders on the Czech Republic, here in the European Parliament. When I was even younger than I am today, this area really was the end of the world. Looking at the gallery, I see so many young people in the audience, and I think we can remind ourselves that it is an historic day when these borders finally fall and we are united in Europe. For that reason, yes, it is a cause for celebration!</p>
      <p sl="de">As a political representative, may I say in all honesty that many people were not convinced that this would work as well as it has, or that our East European friends, one for all, would implement SIS in this way. May I express my congratulations and respect for that achievement. I would also like to thank Carlos Coelho. The fact that the European Parliament is playing such a major role when it comes to Schengen is due to our rapporteur. I would like to emphasise that point as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, politicians always have to think of tomorrow and what will be facing us then. Here, I would like to remind everyone of what the Executive Director of Frontex, Ilkka Laitinen, said at the last meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council: he said that migration flows are already demonstrably changing, away from the southern border across the Mediterranean and towards the eastern border. That is something we need to prepare for today. We must also work through the problems identified in the evaluation reports. That is why the evaluation clause proposed by Parliament is so important.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need SIS II and may I appeal to the Vice-President of the Commission not to cease applying pressure here, for it is important that Member States resist any temptation to sit back and say, that is it, we have done it. We need the same level of commitment from them when it comes to the implementation of SIS II as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once we have open borders for citizens, we will also have open borders for criminals, and when we have open borders for criminals, we need open borders for our police as well. For that reason, there must be no slackening of commitment now when it comes to the Prüm Treaty; we need closer cooperation here too.</p>
      <p sl="de">As my fifth point, may I say that there is a need for a strengthening of Frontex. I would like to see Frontex taking on responsibility for the evaluation of standards at the external borders in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will be celebrating in December, and I hope that what will come afterwards will not be a hangover but the positive memory of the celebration itself and the reasons for it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with the accession of nine new Member States to the Schengen area, which is a true and final falling of the historical Iron Curtain, the EU has truly given the opportunity to their European citizens to travel and fraternise in a reciprocal manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last autumn I drew the attention of the Estonian public to the threat that the accession of the new Member States might be delayed until the beginning of 2009. I am glad that the European Commission has found the means to speed up the process and I hope that it has not affected the pertinence of the system. But, besides the positive products of this accession, the EU must be up to the challenge of managing the possible threats that might result from such a vast administrative unit.</p>
      <p sl="en">The SIS is a necessary safeguard to secure the normal functioning of the Schengen area and it should definitely be left open to future complements. Now the practice might induce some new issues. Working off the threats and maintaining a flexible nature is essential for the SIS to address the challenges that this enlargement brings about.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit of the Schengen Treaty is about safeguarding the security of European citizens. To this end, it is undoubtedly better to have a few queues at borders and in airports rather than allowing free entry not only to decent people but also to the most hardened criminals, whom we do not want in our countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">We wish to see border checks, for example on Romanian Roma, with compulsory detection of biometric data including digital fingerprints. We must know who we are allowing into our country, as well as the exact date of entry, so as to be able for example to apply scrupulously the European Directive enabling us – as pointed out just a moment ago – to expel after three months anyone who lacks the funds to support themselves.</p>
      <p sl="it">Romano Prodi’s Commission made commitments to the new Member States without giving any consideration at all to emergencies, of which there have been several since then. They are now giving rise to appalling security problems, and the European Union must think not only about European citizens’ rights, but also about their security. Security is an inalienable right, a natural right.</p>
      <p sl="it">Action is now required, and Commissioner Frattini is quite rightly sending out well-balanced, positive signals in this regard, but we should not forget that Schengen must also concern itself with checks at the European Union's external borders, and must do so ever more efficiently. We have nothing against any ethnic group or population group, still less against our brothers in Eastern Europe; however, we do not want criminals moving around freely in our land.</p>
      <p sl="it">Padania is a land of honest, hard-working people. Its doors are open only to those who come to work, who behave well and – as befits the European Union's area of justice and freedom – who abide by the rules, namely the rules of honesty and law and order.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The history of the enlargement of the Schengen area is marked by double standards. In 1995 the three new Schengen states only had to fulfil a few formalities. In 2004, however, the new Member States were subjected to a series of humiliating controls and assessments lasting three and a half years. There were objections from Germany and Austria in particular, which maintained that enlarging the existing Schengen Information System to include the new countries was not possible. In the end this problem was overcome thanks to the Portuguese Presidency, which is to be highly commended for having been able to overrule these voices.</p>
      <p sl="cs">SISone4all now fulfils all the requirements. The new Members are now ready to ensure adequate security of the Schengen area. There are a few issues that have yet to be resolved, such as data protection, perhaps even protection of the new Member States against the transport of toxic substances, such as in the case of Germany and the Czech Republic. I believe, however, that all these issues will be successfully dealt with and that Europe will not in the process become some sort of enclosed fortress. I hope that Europe will continue to be open to collaboration with other nations of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. Without Eastern Europe and the Balkans, Europe is not and will never be complete.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, like the European Ministers of Home Affairs this Parliament is now giving the green light to the extension of the Schengen system to the Member States that joined in 2004.It will be a relief to many.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, I am somewhat less euphoric about Schengen itself: the fact is that the European policy of open borders also noticeably strengthens the scope of international organised crime. As a result, Schengen has a spill-over effect. The system of open borders has always demanded a further transfer of competences and ever-closer police cooperation, which will eventually result in a full-blown European police force, prosecutors and criminal law, with their positive but also their negative aspects.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the policy of open borders renders the individual Member States powerless in the face of the regularisation programmes for illegal migrants adopted in certain countries – I am thinking of Spain and Italy in particular – which always attract more migrants to Europe’s poorly protected borders. The famous European solidarity is completely lacking here and this has to be said.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the decision on the Schengen issue was mission impossible, as Mr Magalhães stated. It proves that if there really is a will to do so, it can be possible to interconnect in practice the areas of freedom for the citizens of Europe, including the freedom to travel, whilst simultaneously reinforcing security for those same citizens, that is to say, internal security. Preparations for this decision have lasted at least 10 years, and have been very intense in the last two of these. In its present form, the Schengen project is quite different from what it was in the mid-1980s. The main difference is that it is now fully enshrined in the Community's legal and organisational order. In other words, as far as the new countries are concerned, the question is not if but when we will begin to benefit fully from the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At this juncture one is inclined to indulge in historical and symbolic reminiscences. After the Second World War the issue of borders and their control resulted in bloody dividing lines being drawn across the map of Europe. Crossing a border often meant risking one's life. As things now stand we can state that part of our post-war legacy has gone forever. The new countries have come through the preparatory stage with flying colours. It is abundantly obvious that many of the solutions adopted by Poland and other new Member States can and do serve as examples for current members of the Schengen area. The wind of change from the new countries will be an inspiration for the old Union, not a threat. It will also help to increase mutual trust.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Schengen enlargement process also constitutes a challenge and hard work for us in Parliament. On a personal level, I was honoured to be able to work with such a distinguished rapporteur as Mr Coelho, with my colleagues from the group, and with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its tremendous determination. Thanks are also due to Mr Frattini for his favourable attitude and commitment to this splendid achievement, which is without precedent in the course of history.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, extending the Schengen area to include nine new Member States is an historic step which completes the enlargement of the European Union and dismantles those borders where once the Iron Curtain separated our nations. There were those who believed, in advance of the process, that it was too early to do this, but we can now allay those fears.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most recent evaluation has shown that the new Members are implementing the Schengen acquis to everyone's satisfaction. Let us be honest: border controls and the traffic jams which they produced have only ever made a limited contribution to our countries' security.</p>
      <p sl="de">Real cross-border organised crime can only be combated effectively through intensive cooperation by our police and security agencies. This cooperation must be improved in future, and everyone is invited to play a role here. After all, among the old Member States, Germany is one of the countries whose borders have been most affected by the removal of controls.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to welcome the citizens of our neighbour countries to our common area of free movement. May I say that people in our own countries – in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Spain – will benefit from the newly acquired freedom as well, whether during their vacations or a visit to friends.</p>
      <p sl="de">On 21 December, Europe will move a step closer together. This is good for its people, and it is good for Europe.</p>

The new Europe is now coming into our reach, in that the dividing lines that were drawn up so skilfully in the past have ceased to exist, and this will have a bigger impact than anything else on the everyday lives of all of us who live in the area. I would like to congratulate and thank the Portuguese Presidency for creating the opportunity and the technical framework for the events of today. We would like to thank Commissioner Frattini for the help that these Member States have received. Last, but not least, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Coelho, for his sense of vocation in dealing with this matter.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We can now feel the advantages of enlargement as a physical reality, and also the symbolic and practical importance of being able, for example, to cross the bridges of the Danube without checks, or rowing across the Danube, which was an inconceivable dream for our parents. The precious desires of generations are coming true. In this way, history now admits that our young heroes of 1956 were right.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, we must do everything to extend this zone as soon as possible to Bulgaria and Romania, who acceded recently. In this latter case – for example in the case of Transylvania – the Romanian-Hungarian border will be so important, and it can only be compared to what must have been felt when the Franco-German border was dissolved, by the people living there.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, we cannot forget that checks will be even more stringent at the external borders of the Schengen zone. For this reason, the ethnic groups living outside our borders, the Hungarians living in Vojvodina and Subcarpathia, will be at a disadvantage: our close contact with them is a condition for their staying there and a constitutional obligation for us. The external borders cannot turn into a new iron curtain for these communities. It is only in this way, paying attention to those who remain outside, that the celebrations for opening up the borders can be complete for us. Thank you for the floor.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At the same time I should like to emphasise that the Schengen system is not intended to isolate the Union from its neighbours. It does not aim to create a so-called fortress Europe. I think we should take this opportunity to send out a signal from the House to our neighbours beyond the Union's borders, including the citizens of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, making it clear that the strengthened Union border is certainly not a wall to defend ourselves against them.

Thanks for this are due to the Portuguese Presidency, which has done everything for us to join at the planned date, in 2007, even though there were attempts to prevent this. The Member States concerned are also due recognition for making great efforts to fulfil the stringent criteria and conditions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is very important that no new iron curtain should fall between the countries that have just joined and their neighbouring countries. The agreements on easing visa procedures and local border traffic might be a great help in this, but the ultimate goal in any case is to achieve visa exemption. A specific, realistic timetable is needed for this, to enable the creation of visa exemption as soon as possible. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="sk">would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Portuguese Presidency for its initiative and for finding a solution by proposing SISone4all, which enabled nine new Member States to join the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The historic significance of this step for the citizens of those countries cannot be doubted. Not only does it make the principle of free movement of people a reality, it also represents a historic step towards the reunification of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for his excellent work and for a remarkable grasp of all the issues. Thanks are also due to Commissioner Frattini for his great commitment and all the help with fulfilling the Schengen criteria.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It was stressed a few times in the report that joining the Schengen area was a matter of mutual trust and I believe that trust is also the underlying theme of our present debate. It is quite clear that border security is not just an issue of technology but also of mutual trust. However, this works both ways. More technologically advanced systems would also undoubtedly help individual Member States to trust the countries protecting the security of the Union’s external borders. We must therefore ask why and how much longer we have to wait for SIS II, which will increase security and facilitate both judicial and police cooperation between Member States in this area. Prolonging the existence of temporary solutions is both costly and inadequate compensation for the non-existence of SIS II.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also want to support the amendment tabled on the fulfilment of the Schengen criteria, which states that Parliament should be informed within six months of the assessment of the situation in the Member States. We should not see a repeat of the situation when the Commission did not want to provide the Parliament with information that was vital for its decision-making.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the joy of the magnificent Christmas present among the 21st century new European citizens is understandable. The expansion of the Schengen area – this special Portuguese flavour – is a historic event of great psychological and symbolic magnitude, lifting not only the borders and divisions in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet, whilst for us it is now possible to travel from the Baltic Vilnius to the Atlantic Lisbon, a new European curtain is being pulled in front of Ukraine, Russia, Moldova and Belarus, a financial and bureaucratic one in place of that very old iron. Not so long ago, our neighbours could travel visa-free to many new Schengen countries, but now they must pay between EUR 35 and 60. This is a quarter or even a third of a monthly salary in some of these countries. We do not need the fortress of Europe while the Schengen acquis, with some improvements, is the key to a stronger and more inclusive Europe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I cannot help welcoming and rejoicing at the eminent enlargement of the Schengen area, which is due to take place at the end of this year. The concepts of ‘Schengen’ and ‘roaming’ are the notions best understood by EU citizens. They can see them actually working; everyone has been influenced by them in one way or another. For most Europeans they are closely associated with the notion of a united Europe.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The accession of nine new Member States is a historical step not just for Lithuania, but for Europe as a whole. For Lithuania it spells another sequential step towards deeper European integration. The preparation has required a lot of work and effort. I am glad that the experts have assessed these efforts and found them to be acceptable and that all nine candidates will be able to join, having successfully ‘passed the test’. I would like to thank the presiding country, Portugal, for having come up with the solution regarding the Schengen Information System, which has prevented our countries from wasting several years.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it emerges from the report by Mr Coelho that nine new Member States are properly prepared for their land borders to be opened on 21 December this year and for their air borders to be opened on 30 March 2008.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite earlier concerns, all these countries have managed to catch up and establish an information system allowing data to be exchanged between organisations responsible for protection of the Union's external borders.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Consequently, the principle of the free movement of persons will be implemented approximately three years after these countries acceded to the Union. I would remind the House that this is one of the four key principles governing the operation of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It was also a good thing that the Council of the European Union responded to the European Parliament's hopes, taking the formal decision to open the borders during the night between 20 and 21 December of this year. This will be a very special Christmas present for the many thousands of Europeans travelling between the old and the new Member States during the Christmas and New Year holiday period.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I would like to start by joining my fellow Members in thanking and expressing my best wishes to Mr Coelho for the useful work that he has done.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Mr President, the enlargement of the Schengen area is not just another historical step in Europe’s development; more than that, it is a major acquisition for European citizens, as it gives them new rights. Mr President, we sometimes forget that there was once a time when, wherever you went in Europe, immigration officials would stamp your passport. In order to leave your country and enter it again you had to fill in an embarkation form to advise authorities where you were going and how long you would be away. On arrival you again passed through immigration control, waited in the queue and were then quizzed: why have you come, what are you going to do, how long are you staying? They almost treated you with suspicion rather than welcoming you, which annoyed many people.</p>
      <p sl="mt">On returning to your country you went through the same thing, with controls in the country of departure and controls when you returned to your own country. We should not forget as well that until a short while ago customs officials checked your baggage, asking you what you had bought, how much you had spent, as if you had some form of contraband.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Mr President, this is not 50 years ago; this is just a short time ago. Now, finally, the controls are going to end once and for all. This means that a country is in the Schengen area. When you travel within the Schengen area, you are as free as you are within your own country; you leave your country, you arrive in another, and you return without controls, without stamps, without borders, without questions. The sense of freedom brought by the freedom of movement without controls is a major acquisition that we really appreciate as one of the greatest successes of the European Union. More and more, for those of us who come from islands, Schengen unites us, builds a bridge between the periphery and the centre; for us, Schengen means a sense of liberty, it means a sense of liberation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The creation of the Schengen area, which does away with controls at the internal borders between all the participating states and thus makes free movement of persons a reality throughout the EU territory, can rightly be considered to be one of the EU’s greatest achievements.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The citizens of the countries joining that area in December will welcome our decision as one that is in the interests of the people, making their right to free movement a reality. However, the enlargement of the Schengen area also requires the introduction of some compensatory measures, including the introduction of effective controls at the external borders, better cooperation between the administration, police, customs and judicial authorities, a common visa policy and the creation of the Schengen Information System. The Slovak Government has, according to all the assessments, completed the preparatory phase very successfully and I am honoured to be able to declare in the European Parliament today that the Slovak Republic is fully prepared to join the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today we are about to finalise the discussion on the application of the Schengen aquis provisions in the new Member States. I welcome the fact that all the hard work put in by those countries about to join the Schengen area, together with the efforts of the existing Member States and the Commission, has led to victory.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The creation of the Schengen area is one of the EU’s biggest projects. In order to facilitate its implementation after the expansion in 2004, when we were having difficulties with the realisation of SIS II, the Member States demonstrated true solidarity; Portugal proposed the SISone4all version, enabling the borders to be opened between the 15 existing Member States and the nine new ones before next Christmas.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This means increased freedom of movement within Europe, and it is also a rational decision, preventing new Member States from incurring losses because of the delay in setting a date for the application of SIS II. SISone4all, which is due to operate for nearly a year, will facilitate the movement of persons while at the same time having a beneficial impact on the countries’ economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of Schengen is an event for all 500 million Europeans and, in fact, for the whole world. By removing controls on its internal borders, the European Union is putting an end to an age which was characterised by division and opposition – East and West.</p>
      <p sl="et">I spent my childhood and teenage years in the Soviet Union. I remember the anxiety engendered by the knowledge that the land and sky were closed off, that the soldiers of the army of occupation were protecting the iron curtain. The accession to Schengen marks the final liberation from the past. The disappearance of borders is a powerful symbol for 75 million Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="et">The nine countries acceding to Schengen are ready to take on the changes in data exchange which go hand in hand with the privilege of free movement. My home country, Estonia, protects one of our external borders. I am nevertheless disappointed that this historic occasion has been split into two smaller events for no convincing reason because air frontiers will not, of course, disappear for eastern Europeans until the end of next March.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I wish to share some ideas regarding Schengen and the way in which I see it. For me, it is not just a matter of what is in the Treaty and what it will provide or the rules that are applied; I see it as part of a process, part of an important process to include diverse European States – in this case two EFTA states – and help them to feel more integrated and move closer to each other. Although we have this independent and sovereign quality, we should on the other hand be proud that we are part of something whole. In this case, entry and exit through common borders – because they are going to become common borders – are part of a process like that of the Euro, part of a process through which my country became part of Europe. We should all be proud that we form part of such a wise continent that also exports the values that it believes in.</p>

    <intervention id="2-246" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Magalhães" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there is total consensus in this House that the imminent enlargement is not only historic but also highly symbolic. However, this consensus is not only institutional but, much more importantly, it is also social as it is what our citizens rightly want. It is right that the EU’s bodies should listen to its citizens and respond in timely fashion to their aspirations. This is what we have done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am very grateful for the positive comments which have highly praised the work carried out not only by the Portuguese Presidency but also by all those who contributed at just the right time so that the many pieces of this complex puzzle could be readied and slotted together just as they should. Just one year ago we were facing a very different situation and it is not only a technological feat, which is in itself very important, but also a political feat that our institutions have achieved for our citizens, which reinforces the credibility of these institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, I must stress that the new external borders are a great Christmas present for our citizens and will be so for many Christmases to come. However, they also provide a new way of managing external relations as we do not want to create a second generation Iron Curtain for our neighbours. What we have is the start of an electronic border, vigorous in its interception of criminals and flexible, like everything electronic, in allowing citizens in good faith to pass rapidly through, whoever they may be and wherever they may be coming from. This is the model that Europe is presenting to the world and this is the commitment to which we are bound.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, this work and this achievement are based on meticulous preparation which has left the partner states in the SISone4all project very well provided with equipment and a police preparation logic which we must link with new measures, such as the reinforcement of Frontex recently announced by the Commission and our new model of integrated border management. This is therefore one more piece in a complex policy that must be pursued and developed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fourthly, I should like to underline that one of the secrets to the success of this project is being able to duly combine security and freedom, freedom of movement, much more freedom of movement, with appropriate data protection. The two things are inseparable. This is the way forward for Europe and it is fortunately also an important point of consensus between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. There is no other way forward, only this one.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This rule is valid for SISone4all and will also be valid for SIS II, for the second generation Schengen Information System. This is obvious in the legislation approved with the seal of the European Parliament and is apparent from the suggestions made in the report prepared by Mr Coelho.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must also say that this applies to the issue of managing confidentiality and transparency. Confidentiality and transparency can be balanced and an optimum balance must be achieved so that all decision-makers have the necessary information to make decisions in full knowledge of the facts. This has been achieved in this process and is surely a point which bodes well for future successes in an excellent relationship between the Commission and the Council on this essential point.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I must also once again stress the importance of the method that we have chosen. We have not run away from bad news or problems. In 2006 we realised that there was a serious problem and we took note of this serious problem. We did not adopt a ‘blame-shame’ attitude but instead tried to find positive solutions to the problems by ensuring exemplary cooperation among the institutions. I have no criticisms to make of the Commission’s behaviour throughout the process and I consider that the Commission should have no criticisms to make of the Council’s behaviour, as managed by the previous German, current Portuguese and future Slovenian Presidencies and other future presidencies. It is this kind of cooperation that I consider necessary to solve European problems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To conclude, we must relish the victory and prepare for the future. I should therefore like to invite the representatives of this House to attend the commemoration, which will be held on 21 and 22 November. This will be a symbolic journey through sites that were previously symbols of closure and that will, from 21 December, be symbols of the freedom that is the air and oxygen breathing life and happiness into Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I too am extremely satisfied with the outcome of this debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">The result which is within our reach today clearly shows that the countries about to join Schengen on 21 and 22 December, and their citizens, really do deserve this Christmas present, as it were. They deserve it because, whereas we have worked together over the past 12 to 15 months to overcome certain technical difficulties - and the Portuguese Presidency cannot be praised highly enough - they have played their part too. They have overcome difficulties and shortcomings - in airports, at border posts and in staff training - which just 12, 13 or 14 months ago seemed hard to overcome.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why they really do deserve what has charmingly been called a Christmas present, and I can say so having visited a number of border posts in person, together with many colleagues - Ministers of the Interior - who showed me the enormous progress made between one visit and the next. I believe that this development is of huge political importance for Europe and has a major social impact, in other words on the citizens. It is of huge political importance because, from 21 December onwards, each Member State will regard another Member State's external borders as its own. I, as an Italian, will regard the far-off border between Poland and Ukraine as my own. That will be my country’s border: such is the political impact of this decision that Europe has managed to take within what is a very reasonable period of time.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there is the social impact, in other words the impact on our citizens’ daily lives which, if I may say so, even goes beyond the symbolic effect of no longer having to queue up at border posts. It means that every law-abiding European citizen will feel at home in any other country of the European Union. It means freedom of movement and not having to show one's passport; it does not merely mean not having to queue up for border checks, but rather feeling that European citizenship has become a reality.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many of you have raised the issue of security, and I entirely agree with what Mr Magalhães has just said. Security and freedom must obviously go hand-in-hand. The more we promote the expansion of this right, this great freedom, the more we must do to prevent criminals from making the most of this great freedom to step up their own dealings and unlawful activities.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why this Europe, this large Schengen area, will not be a fortress but certainly will protect EU citizens from criminal comings and goings. Furthermore, it is obvious for this reason that the Schengen system - currently the ‘one for all’ Schengen system and soon to be Schengen II - must be equipped with the best technology. Criminals tend to evade controls, of course, and we must have the technological instruments to prevent that from happening, such as the use of biometrics, showing full respect for everyone's freedom but in order - as it were - to ward off temptation.</p>
      <p sl="it">One last word: I was struck by what has been said about Europe's neighbours. Clearly, an enlarged Schengen area must not engender the risk of shutting out those countries which now adjoin the expanded Schengen borders. As you know, we have to use this Schengen system to monitor and administer 80 000 km of EU external borders, and Frontex will play an ever greater role here. Just think what an enormous task that is, but we have to perform it. Well, this must not happen to the detriment of our neighbours, of the relationships some have mentioned: the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have therefore embarked on a new approach, and I would once again ask you, the European Parliament, now that you are giving the final green light to this action, to confirm your support for the policy which I proposed to the Council and which the Council of Ministers has endorsed. It is a new-style visa policy, aimed at facilitating the movement of honest people, accompanied by measures on document security, personal identification and the use of biometrics, but which offers citizens now living extremely close to but not within this European area a tangible opportunity to go occasionally to the theatre in Vienna or to see the Coliseum in Rome or to visit Lisbon, without the enormous difficulty and expense currently involved in obtaining a visa.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new approach is as follows. Let us make visa policy an instrument of our neighbourhood policy, and let us do so at the same time as enlarging the Schengen area. This, in my opinion, would hopefully be another political, purely political, step; it is neither a bureaucratic nor a narrowly legal matter. It is a political message that we can send to other states and their citizens, who are watching us from Europe’s neighbourhood but do not need to look on in envy because we are free to move around while they cannot even attend a university course in a European city.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to ensure that no such envy exists and that Europe is loved by its neighbours, let us accompany the enlargement of Schengen with a policy of friendship, using visas and greater freedom of movement as a strategic instrument.</p>

      <p sl="hu">We can still remember the fear we felt when we crossed the iron curtain of the time with valid passports in our pockets. The passport was valid in vain, and we got all the stamps in it in vain, because something could always happen at the border. Or, if not, we were afraid of it because crossing the border was an extraordinary event in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Since the iron curtain came down, border traffic has become simpler, but the checks have remained, and the borders can still only be crossed at a few designated places, which primarily made life more difficult for the people living there. Now that has ended too, and the borders – as Hungarian democrats have wanted for many decades – have ‘turned into thin air’. From now on we shall also find it natural that the people who live near the border can go across into another country just as naturally as from, let’s say, Budapest to Budakeszi by car, by the number 22 bus or on foot using footpaths.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Complete freedom of movement without checks is particularly important for people belonging to the same nation who live on both sides of the border. Recently we have not adopted much legislation that is more important than this, and I am proud that I can be part of this wonderful process!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the first Euromed Ministerial Conference on Migration will be held in Santa Eulália, in the Algarve, Portugal, between 18 and 19 November. Said like this, it seems the most banal of statements, but it is not. We have managed to organise this high-level ministerial conference after this was defined as a priority by our Heads of State and Government in November 2005. That was nearly two years ago, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Process Summit, when the growing importance of migration issues within our Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was recognised. Subsequently, as some of you will certainly remember, we had occasion in Rabat, Tripoli to reaffirm our common political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We did this realistically and lucidly, in the Council’s opinion. There are now, on both sides of the Mediterranean region, sizeable migrant communities which play a very important role in our societies. We have a duty to give new impetus to the Partnership which can take advantage of the existence of these vigorous communities. The complexity and significance of migration issues mean that everyone needs to tackle these, both countries of origin and countries of transit and destination. At this first conference in the Algarve, the Council feels that the debate should be focused on the most pressing issues and only on these, with a step-by-step approach to these issues.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The main items on the agenda will be the priority areas agreed at the Ministerial Meeting in Tampere, namely immigration and development, legal migration and the fight against illegal migration. These areas cover such important subjects as the framework for migrants’ remittances, the new challenge of micro-credit, the opportunities that we are creating in the European Union and on both sides of the Mediterranean for legal migration, the essential issue of document security raised earlier in another respect by Vice-President Frattini – security of travel documents is crucial for allowing migratory flows to develop under secure conditions – and the very important issue of return conditions, where applicable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that the preparatory work carried out in recent weeks can result in a positive conclusion which bodes well for the debate to be held in the Algarve. There is a clear determination on both sides to find positive solutions and concrete measures and to agree and implement these measures. In this respect, the Council informs the European Parliament of its conviction that the conference will reach agreement on concrete measures that will enable us to take our Partnership forward.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We hope that these efforts will result in a final statement which, due to the careful process of preparation, will receive ministerial approval in the Algarve. This statement must unequivocally define the main priorities and will also determine the specific projects to be implemented in the short term. We therefore consider that this initiative is developing in a positive framework and will prove to be inspiring and a significant moment in our Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. This is the Council’s duty and also the result that we want, and it is fully within our reach.</p>

    <intervention id="2-253" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, improving migration management in the Mediterranean region will certainly be one of the priorities for the EU and its Euromed partners. Too many people are drowning, and we are not benefiting sufficiently from the potential that well-managed migration can bring.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the summit in 2005, which was just mentioned, the Euromed Heads of State and Government adopted a work programme that set goals for cooperation on migration, social integration, justice and security. Now, thanks to the excellent initiative taken by the Portuguese Presidency, ministers responsible for migration will have the opportunity to take the next steps in making the cooperation more concrete. It promises to be a big milestone. I welcome the Presidency’s emphasis on concrete operational outcomes from the conference, because our citizens want to see very concrete results.</p>
      <p sl="en">The three themes for this meeting are well balanced and fully in line with the global approach. First of all, legal migration: we live in a world of increasing mobility, and well-managed migration is in the interests of all partners. The European Union needs migration in full respect of the law. The need for workers in many Member States of the EU is already evident, for example, in agriculture, health care and tourism. However, the European Union needs to be able to manage and integrate these migrants. We need to match skills better than in the past and we have to prepare migrants for their life in the EU and their eventual return if their migration is temporary or circular in nature. No migratory strategy is possible unless a European policy towards integrating migrants who live and work in the EU is in full respect of the law.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will be discussing how to use the European Integration Fund that, for the first time, is available in the EU, thanks to a proposal made a year and a half ago by the Commission and endorsed by the Council and this Parliament. We need to make Europe more attractive to legal migrants. Our recent proposal for a European ‘Blue Card’ for highly skilled migrants is the first example and relevant to the Euromed context.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next year’s legislative initiatives for unskilled and seasonal migrants and remunerated trainees will follow. The proposals to launch discussions on these matters with our Euromed partners seem to me logical and timely.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point is migration and development. In order to be successful in managing migration, we must also address the main roots of migration, such as economic disparity, lack of career opportunities, instability, poor governance etc. Good cooperation with partner countries and detailed knowledge of the situation on the ground in terms of labour needs, skilled shortages and capacity-building requirements are essential to this effort. That is why ministers will discuss with the Commission the concrete proposals on migrant remittances and how they could be made more productive for development – a debate that is to be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third area of discussion is illegal migration, because to be comprehensive we must also tackle illegal migration and protect European external borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our Euromed partners are countries of destination, transit and origin. We should aim to establish cooperation to prevent people drowning at sea. At the Euromed Conference we will be talking with ministers about cooperation and a possible new role for Frontex in search and rescue activities, not only in patrolling and the return of illegal migrants. In doing so, we need to ensure that we respect our obligations when it comes to international protection and human rights. We would support a development whereby Frontex becomes a tool of support for third countries in their efforts to better manage migration and control their borders by fully respecting international obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are looking forward to this ministerial meeting. Migration is a subject of vital interest to us all, and that raises strong passions at Member State and Community level. It is no different in our partner countries. However, working together is the only way to move forward. I would say cooperation alone is no longer sufficient. We need partnership based on shared goals and on equality of all partners. We need political packages, including measures to improve both the movement of honest people and respect of national and European laws, and to increase local growth rates in the origin countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I believe that the ministers will be successful in identifying concrete areas for cooperation. The Commission stands ready to support the implementation process, including in financial terms. We are committed to supporting such actions through the MEDA Programme, as well as the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the new thematic programmes.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I certainly welcome this meeting with the Mediterranean partners. I would, however, have preferred the Ministers for Foreign Affairs to be present, as at the Europe-Africa meeting in Rabat. Why? I wanted them here to emphasise the fact that immigration must be a major issue in our relations with the countries of the southern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are neighbouring countries with vast income differences. Many of their nationals are now working to the north of the Mediterranean and their transfer constitute an essential development issue, as has already been said. These countries are experiencing considerable growth of their population, a population now seeking a better life in Europe. We are suffering the effects of illegal immigration from these countries, which in turn are also countries of transit for sub-Saharan emigrants.</p>
      <p sl="es">This means that the integration of residents, the connection between immigration and development and illegal immigration are of vital importance. Thus the ministerial meeting in the Algarve has plenty of work to do.</p>
      <p sl="es">We discussed immigration in the House recently: I am referring to the Klich and Moreno reports. I trust that due consideration will be given to them in the discussions.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would just like to make a few comments in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first is the need to ensure that the southern countries cooperate closely with us to control migratory flows and to encourage them with what I would call ‘positive conditionality’. The phenomenon of immigration is much easier to control where there is political will to do so. Results are achieved if a neighbour really wishes to cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, illegal immigration is still very much a current issue. We must prevent illegal immigrants arriving by sea; these immigrants are also risking their lives. There are even children, victims of the activities of those who deal unscrupulously in human lives. The Mediterranean countries must be asked to sign and ratify the two Protocols to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime in relation to trafficking in persons.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, I must reiterate the need to draw up readmission agreements. This has been done with Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, so why has it not yet been done with Morocco after so many years? What is happening with Algeria?</p>
      <p sl="es">I wish the Euromed Conference every success, Mr President. I hope that the participants secure specific commitments and solid agreements that will actually be implemented and not end up as a mere juxtaposition of mutual wishes not subsequently followed up in practice.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, scientists claim that almost two million years ago climate change led to the first large-scale migration from Africa to Europe. In our age, although climate change may have something to do with it, poverty and a dearth of freedom and opportunities are still the main reasons why large numbers of emigrants risk their lives for a better deal on our continent.</p>
      <p sl="es">The challenge we face as Europeans is to make immigration a genuine part of development for both countries of origin and countries of destination, and have development make its contribution to reducing illegal immigration. This is why we must work alongside countries of origin and transit towards true mobility for a workforce with rights and obligations, not a workforce of slaves.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore wish to reiterate that we need dialogue, cooperation and solidarity to build a cohabitation space between the north and south of the Mediterranean. Therefore we wholeheartedly welcome this Euromed Summit in accordance with the Ministerial Conferences in Rabat and Tripoli. Dialogue between countries of origin and transit and European states receiving immigrants must be institutionalised in order to provide a cornerstone for a genuine association based on development.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take a look at a number of areas that could be examined during the summit. Immigrants must enter Europe and work there in full respect of the law. This means that initiatives such as the Blue Card directive constitute a necessary step, but this is not sufficient. It must be enhanced by a directive applicable to less highly skilled immigrants and accompanied by measures to increase circular migration, genuine circular migration that prevents a brain drain and allows returning emigrants to carry through vital projects in their own countries, with the proper social and economic conditions to do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Euromed space must be an area of prosperity, freedom and development. We must continue to explore, as Spain is now doing with a number of these countries, the possibility of hiring and training workers at origin by creating workshop schools and vocational training facilities there.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, let us send a clear message through information campaigns on the chance of emigrating and working legally in Europe, and a warning as to the futile risks of illegal emigration to prevent thousands of young people from falling into the hands of mafias and risking their lives in ramshackle boats or canoes.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I wish to ask for particular attention to be paid at the summit to the most vulnerable emigrants, women and children, especially unaccompanied children.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these matters will be discussed at a meeting to be held here in Parliament from 6 to 8 December at the initiative of the ALDE Group and in conjunction with the transnational Radicals. I think we need a new way forward here.</p>
      <p sl="it">Perhaps I am being presumptuous but I appeal to you personally, ladies and gentlemen of the presidency-in-office, Commissioner Frattini and even you, Mr President, not to let your institutions take their eyes off the ball. The issue under discussion, neighbourhood policy, this laudable new initiative, will undoubtedly become bogged down in bureaucracy like so many others: Lisbon, but also Barcelona and all the rest. President Prodi said a good deal when unveiling the neighbourhood policy; he talked about everything apart from the institutions. No, the problem lies elsewhere!</p>
      <p sl="it">You, Mr Frattini, said that we need to do more in our area of work. That is not the traditional problem; we are sufficiently up to speed. On the other side of the Mediterranean, however, there is a need for entrepreneurship, of the kind Israel has devoted to its desert areas over a lengthy period. My time is nearly up, so I would really urge you to note the date of this meeting, and to bear in mind that the problem, the sticking-point, is partnership; the challenge is membership. Europe itself would not have come into being if it had been confined to partnership, as some wanted at the time. The problem is that our Europe has limits. Sultan Hassan II pointed out the solution in 1987; let us now pursue it in the face of Europe’s blindness.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as everyone has said, including those speaking this morning, migration is a priority for the European Union and for Euromed relations. It is a major issue for those people who are often forced to leave a homeland that has been devastated by poverty, desertification, floods, war and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Will the Euromed Ministerial Conference be equal to the task? Nothing could be less sure. The preparatory documents are hopelessly lacking in substance. This is hardly surprising since we know that none of the organisations on the ground – including those that are actually confronted every day with the situation facing migrants who are either in transit, aimlessly wandering or at risk of their life afloat on the Mediterranean – not a single one of them has been involved in the preparations, not even the HCR.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Preconclusions mean turning a blind eye to the right of asylum, to the illegal detention of migrants and the respect for their rights, whether they happen to be legitimate or not, to the unacceptable violence to which they are subjected, especially women migrants, to the rights of minors and to the criminalisation of giving aid to migrants and migrant families. This blindness is total when it comes to meeting the Union’s international commitments and the agreements that have to implemented or ratified: it is the Geneva Convention for some, and for others, which means all the countries of the European Union, it is the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where do we really hope we are going with such a Euro-Mediterranean policy, with such a clear absence of demands when it comes to nations’ shared rights and obligations? Where is the risk? The risk is that of having a smoke-screen of handpicked legal migrations behind which we find sustained and massive rights’ violations for all the others. If it is trying to spare the more sensitive souls by giving up on a really ambitious policy then the conference is doing its best to be a real waste of time. From the word go it would provide pre-justification for the proliferation of bilateral agreements of the Italy-Libya kind, signed on the sly, which violate the principle of the withholding of removal and do so with complete impunity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not too late to act. Invite the HCR, invite a representative from the NGOs, start out again with the initial document put forward by the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which is much more ambitious, and the conference may just turn out to be a positive and significant milestone.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming Euromed Ministerial Conference is without doubt important, complex and a matter of urgency in view of the tragedies we are witnessing in our seas on a daily basis. I nevertheless think it is a shame that there has been no involvement of NGOs, which in fact have a great deal of experience with migration issues, including for example projects such as micro-finance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Last weekend a meeting of parliamentarians, displaced persons, refugees and NGOs took place in Volterra, where we launched a Charter on the right of asylum and refugees, a topic which I believe is missing from the Ministerial Conference. On that occasion we drew a clear distinction between refugees and migrants, asserting the rights of both groups: the former sanctioned by the Geneva Convention of 1951 and the latter by the International Convention on the rights of migrant workers and their families, which I think has been ratified by just five of the 37 countries participating in the Barcelona Process.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore hope that the Commission and the Council will endeavour to ascertain what the obstacles are and urge ratification.</p>

      <p sl="de">Thank you, Mr President. Mr Magalhães stated that the Euromed meeting on 18 and 19 November would be the first meeting by Euromed on immigration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Illegal immigration to Europe is indeed a massive problem for many European countries, posing particular problems for those countries with coastlines within easy reach of North Africa. Great Britain has its particular problems with immigration, too. Illegal – and legal – immigration to Britain is now uncontrolled, unlimited and indiscriminate, in the true meaning of that word. Britain has a massive problem with illegal immigration, but currently the biggest problem is caused by legal immigration from the European Union. The rate of immigration to Britain, as far as anybody can tell, is running at about 500 000-600 000 people per annum, with a net change to population of about 200 000 people per annum, adding one million people to the population every five years. Britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and England, taken on its own, is right at the top of the league of densely populated countries. Immigration to Britain on this level is simply unsustainable. It is putting unbearable strains on infrastructure and public services. It would be possible to control immigration into Britain by taking some very basic measures. None of these measures would be possible while we are a member of the EU: they would all be illegal. The solution for Britain, if it wants to control its immigration, is simply to leave the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Our group visited the southmost point of Europe – the island of Lampedusa, on which an immigration centre is located. There we met a group of people whose boat had sunk and people had died. Although they had lost friends, those illegal immigrants were in quite good spirits and the reason was, in my opinion, the too big tolerance within the EC to illegal immigrants. They are so much tolerated that, having reached the EU shores, they feel as if their mission was accomplished.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Therefore measures are to be introduced to tell an illegal immigrant even before his or her departure that the risk of drowning is all too high. And even if this does not happen and the immigrant reaches the territory of the European Union, it has to be clear that he or she will not stay there.</p>
      <p sl="bg">For if we care for human beings dying in their attempts at illegal immigration, then we shall be reassured that there will be no people making such attempts.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to take a few moments to express my support, our support, for Commissioner Frattini and to say emphatically to him that the attacks made on him in connection with the issue of Romanies in Italy are absolutely intolerable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The subject of migratory movements is a key issue that must be placed at the centre of our dialogue, our partnership and our cooperation with the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean region, continuing on from the conferences of Rabat and Tripoli.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is an area in which the Member States cannot act alone. We need support and cooperation from our partner nations, which are themselves often source countries or transit countries, if our migration policy is to be made more effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to work with them to reach a consensus on the returns policy, to increase the number of agreements on readmission and together to implement a policy of intelligent codevelopment so that nationals from these countries are able to remain in their homeland and contribute towards its growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question of migratory movements has a security dimension, but it also has a human dimension that should not be ignored. This is why I would like to see respect for fundamental human rights made one of the themes of the conference. I hope that this meeting will provide an opportunity for open and realistic exchanges, so that together we can find the most appropriate solutions for everyone concerned.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am also pleased that the subject of immigration has been chosen for the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the Euromed zone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that until now we have failed to put in place a European policy on immigration. We know that this is a difficult question because it affects the sovereignty of Member States and they are keen to see a very strict application of the principle of subsidiarity in this area. We also know that the subject of immigration, or migration, is a contentious issue in our dealings with partner countries to the south, who often reproach us for tackling this problem purely as a security matter. I thank Commissioner Frattini for having adopted a much more global approach to this question, which includes the economic and social dimensions associated with migratory movements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Legal immigration and illegal immigration are two sides of the same coin and it is not possible to combat illegal immigration without at the same time establishing channels for legalised immigration into Europe. I therefore welcome the Blue Card scheme, which is the European counterpart of the American Green Card scheme, and am pleased that the legal immigration channels being recommended by the Council evidently take into account Europe’s economic requirements as well as meeting the real needs of the countries of the South.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the issuing of visas I believe that the Union should make this a more straightforward process, especially for students, researchers and those involved in civil society. I think that readmission agreements, especially with Algeria and Morocco, should ensure that any returns procedure should be strictly controlled by mechanisms that guarantee the rights of migrants. Finally, in view of the new wave of migration currently confronting us from sub-Saharan Africa, I firmly support the idea that Europe must not use the Barcelona Process to shift responsibility for managing migratory movements back to the frontiers of the Mediterranean zone because it is incapable of dealing with this matter at its own borders.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, migration is one of the priority topics in the European Union. The Euromed region is, in that respect, a strategically important region for us. The Euromed ministerial conference on migration will be the first of its kind to focus solely on this issue and include the Euromed partners. It is therefore all the more regrettable that no consultation with civil society organisations was held in advance of the conference.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is equally regrettable that the aspect of asylum was excluded from the agenda for the ministerial conference, especially bearing in mind the hopeless situation of refugees in many parts of the southern and eastern Mediterranean due to the lack of appropriate legislation to protect them. None of these countries, as we know, has any asylum laws. Only a few of them recognise the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Libya, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan have not ratified the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also to be regretted that the members of the Barcelona Process talk about the rights of migrants but are silent when it comes to the rights of illegal migrants. The fact is that illegal migrants also have rights, especially when it comes to the enforceability of wages, access to education for their children, or basic medical care, especially for women migrants, where the relevant protective provisions apply.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want cooperation in our efforts to combat illegal migration, we must not deny or neglect one aspect: respect for the rights of migrants and refugees.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In preparing for the Euromed Ministerial Conference, which is to take place on 18 and 19 November, it is important for the Union to note that the Euromed parliamentary meeting is the only forum in which Members of the European Parliament represent the EU alongside members of national parliaments from the southern Mediterranean region, including Israel and Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am pleased to be able to participate in the work of Euromed’s policy section, which, I believe, has a key role to play in the context of the Barcelona Process. The topic of this meeting could not have been chosen better. The problem of migration presents many challenges, be it development, in that migrants need information on the option of micro-credit and other types of loans, aspects of legal migration to the EU, but also the burning issue of illegal migration, which requires an urgent solution.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I welcome the fact that the EU has been deepening its relations with some of the Mediterranean countries, which are showing political will and taking steps to change. Indeed, association agreements have already been signed with some of them. As far as illegal migration is concerned, it is necessary to find a solution to the difficult situation caused by the arrival of thousands of unwelcome migrants, who have a serious impact on the security situation in Malta and Italy in particular, but also in some other EU Member States. My own country has also been experiencing an influx of both legal and illegal migrants. I am in favour of the European Union welcoming skilled migrants, whose skills, as Commissioner Frattini said, are needed and can contribute to agriculture, health care and tourism in the EU, but they must be already qualified when they are being allowed in; unskilled migrants should not as a rule be accepted and I believe that the Blue Card scheme will also help to solve this problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the issue of migration demonstrates very clearly to us how close Africa is to Europe. What happens in Africa affects Europe directly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Migration flows from the crisis areas to the south of the Mediterranean terminate in the Mediterranean countries of Southern Europe, which means, of course, that they directly affect Europe as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">Africa is a continent with a wealth of talented people. We ourselves, and Africa, must be clever and use this potential in and for Africa. This partnership which we are striving for with Africa offers a huge opportunity. The offer which we aim to extend from the European Union is very challenging. It ranges from help towards self-help in the fields of security, trade and good governance to stabilisation programmes, including assistance to combat crime, the creation of training places and jobs, the offer of microcredits, and information campaigns about the opportunities for legal forms of migration and all the consequences of illegal migration and measures to combat it.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the European Union, at the next Summit, must also make demands. One of these demands must be for readmission agreements with all countries in the southern Mediterranean before we launch all our action programmes, because all these aspects interact with each other and because what we want is a partnership.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree with Commissioner Frattini when he says that what we are talking about now is partnership and no longer about cooperation; it is about partnership and the offer of complex packages. The European Parliament is ready for this, the Commission supports it and so does Parliament, and Africa must be invited to use these offers in the interests of stabilising North Africa and also in the interests of the security of EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Commission and Parliament have already given the green light to the proactive and, more importantly, common immigration policy, however unpopular it might be. For a wealthy, ageing Europe, immigration is indeed a reality. We know that illegal immigration can decrease the GDP of several countries by up to 20%, whilst their economic growth is limited by the reduction in the number of skilled workers. The time has come to reinforce international coordination and agree on reasonable common rules.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I trust that next week in the Algarve, the Euromed Ministerial Conference will proceed in this direction, and that it will not only debate but agree on joint steps for successful migration management and propose measures to alleviate the impact on countries of transit. We need to agree on international obligations with third countries to protect the lives of migrants who take the risk of fleeing by sea.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As a transit region, the Mediterranean countries experience a disproportionate influx of immigrants travelling to the EU and thus require specific measures. The forthcoming conference can be assured that Parliament takes this issue very seriously. Our common priorities are to ensure decent detention areas for immigrants from third countries and to combat the factors that cause mass migration. We have to protect the lives and dignity of migrants.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also encourage Euromed to make it clear that the Blue Card for the regulation of qualified immigrants is not a threat to Europeans; on the contrary, it is an opportunity offered to us by globalisation. The trade unions’ resistance to the Blue Card is an irresponsible, populist gesture, bordering on xenophobia. It is not legal, but illegal, migration that is the cause of dumping on the European labour market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Commissioner Frattini wants Europe to attract a skilled workforce. We will have to woo them here from the US, where the annual influx is 55%, compared with the meagre 5% influx into Europe today. I am convinced that this is the right strategy and that it is line with the EU’s position in the global context. Legal and illegal migration are connected. The success of a coherent, safe and common migration policy will be a test of the EU’s maturity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council will take from this debate the firm belief that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must be developed and solidified and that it is right to hold the Ministerial Conference in Santa Eulália. This cooperation, this Partnership – which is the new word and concept – must be based on concrete projects in order to ensure success. There are many good reasons for this and many dramatic situations, very expressively evoked by Members of this House, which require us to change the status quo . This will only happen if we can take a long-term view and act quickly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have an overall vision, a global approach, action plans and ambitious legislative proposals as mentioned here today by Vice-President Frattini. We must take concrete steps in relation to projects, particularly in the three areas mentioned. Firstly, in the area of migration and development, we must take steps to develop specific actions. This is what the Ministerial Conference plans to do in the area of transfer of remittances and micro-credit. That is why we are going to have to bring together all the actors (which is not a decision that the Members, the Commission or the Council can take) such as banks, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, immigrants’ associations and civil society, in order to find specific ways of encouraging the use of financial services and reinforcing their efficiency, particularly through alternative methods for transferring money and the use of new technologies which can also really help to achieve our objectives. We will certainly have no difficulty in setting up a Euro-Mediterranean website with full information on remittances, including the costs in order to stimulate competition and reduce these costs, which is a central objective that unites us with our partners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards legal migration, we need specific initiatives in this area too. We should like to set up a working group with representatives from the Euromed partners and other social partners in order to study in greater depth the labour situation and the needs of labour markets, to develop training actions for migrant workers before they migrate, to study the possibility of making the European Union portal accessible to all Euromed partners in the area of migration and employment, and to create job search management and information centres in the Euromed countries, naturally in accordance with national competences in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also need specific projects in the area of illegal migration. Bearing in mind that many Euromed partners are also countries of destination and transit for migratory flows, it is important that we reinforce institutional competence in the area of the fight against illegal migration. We must therefore also develop specific actions such as the following: firstly, we should develop document security because only this can allow the correct identification of persons and flows, more confidence and greater ease of movement; secondly, we should develop the access of Euromed partners to Frontex training courses so that they can boost their know-how on fighting illegal migration, in accordance with all the international instruments by which we are bound, in particular the instruments on maritime search and rescue. This could be an initial concrete step towards participation in joint actions under the coordination of Frontex. We also need initiatives in the area of voluntary return and readmission. An open discussion on this issue would be useful in order to consider information campaigns, identification processes, assisted voluntary return processes and the negotiation of readmission agreements with countries of origin. These and many other points will be tackled in Santa Eulália in the Algarve.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there may be many different opinions but one thing is absolutely certain, and I am leaving this debate with this impression: there is no alternative to this path of dialogue and effective partnership. This is the only way to change the status quo and we are all absolutely agreed on the fact that it is essential to change the status quo . Santa Eulália could be a very important step in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has brought forth many practical suggestions as well as some interesting thoughts.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that one strategic policy issue is how to progress from cooperation to a genuine partnership, so as ultimately to achieve membership of a real Euro-Mediterranean common area. Mr Pannella's idea is of great interest, and clearly such a strategy requires long-term thinking on our part. Only once there is a true Euro-Mediterranean single area will there be a joint sense of belonging that prompts us to work towards the shared goal now being established. We first had to obtain the consensus of all 27 Member States; now we are consulting with our partners on the southern shore. The way forward has been mapped out.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second very practical idea, which I shall definitely take up at the Euromed meeting, is an appeal to all participants at that meeting to ensure that their respective countries ratify the existing international conventions. Before dreaming up any new rules, let us bear in mind that very few countries have ratified and implemented some extremely important international conventions. I am thinking, among others, about the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. If there is one subject on which a convention must be ratified immediately, it is the international trafficking and trade in human beings.</p>
      <p sl="it">The third idea comes from Mr Gaubert, to whom I am particularly grateful for emphasising the humanitarian dimension of this major debate. We are not talking here about laws or bureaucratic matters; we are talking about women, men and children who - as others have said - are risking and often losing their lives. It is therefore a matter of solidarity. I believe that showing solidarity towards people who are suffering is the keystone in building a relationship genuinely based on equal rights for our partners.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fourth idea which I shall take away from this debate is how to move on, to put it a little bluntly, from final documents to tangible action. We have drawn up numerous documents and, if the truth be told, we have mounted some significant practical initiatives. We must now build on these practical activities, for example by deciding how best to use development aid funds. Obviously, if we in the European Union have funds available to assist local development, we must also have the capacity to understand how best to spend them. As someone said, we must for example have ways of giving positive incentives to those partners, those countries which actively cooperate in our joint strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Given that there is a common strategy, known since Barcelona as the Euro-Mediterranean strategy, and given that some countries are implementing it to a greater extent than others, I think those countries should be given an incentive, some positive recognition. This, in my opinion, is for example a meaningful way of eradicating corruption. Corruption is one of the root causes of illegal immigration. If there were less corruption in countries of origin, and if there were less corruption in transit countries, then many traffickers in human beings would be stopped en route to Europe and there would be more cooperation; but that is only one example.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, there is the question of taking a credible, firm stance on unlawful conduct. Mr Magalhães emphasised this point and I fully agree: we have no credibility unless we demonstrate that unlawful conduct can be neither rewarded nor tolerated. We must be crystal clear about this. Some have touched on the subject of readmission agreements in this context. Readmission agreements lend credibility to our policy because people who fail to abide by our laws must be repatriated, with all due respect for their individual rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, there is a political point here: states of origin which take back their fellow citizens cannot function as the European Union's border guards. I am putting this a little bluntly: they are not prepared to cooperate with us solely on security grounds.</p>
      <p sl="it">For that reason, one topic I shall raise at this conference is how our policy on visas and the movement of persons can be used as a political incentive for those countries, for example in terms of greater mobility for students and business people. Let us use Europe’s visa policy to facilitate such freedom of movement, thereby sending out a positive political signal to the states with which we are seeking readmission agreements. We did so with the Western Balkans, and in my opinion the time has now come to envisage the same general approach for the Mediterranean.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0412/2007) by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding [COM(2007)0634 – C6-0202/2007 – 2007/0130(COD) ].</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 27 June this year the Commission presented a proposal, based on Article 191 of the EC Treaty, which aims to improve and adapt Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 on the status and funding of political parties at European level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This proposal was followed by a report which evaluated the application of the Regulation. The corresponding resolution was adopted by the European Parliament on 23 March 2006. The Commission’s proposal introduces a new element: the possibility of funding European political foundations bearing in mind that these have an important role to play in underpinning and promoting the activities and objectives of the political parties at European level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Since the political foundations are closely affiliated with the European political parties, it is proposed that they must submit their application for funding through the political party at European level with which they are linked, under the same legal basis as applies to the latter’s funding, in other words under Article 191 of the EC Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I know that the political parties represented in this House are forming or have already formed foundations at European level. The Council looks favourably on the possibility of providing Community financial support for the activities of these foundations under very clear rules which will allow, among other aspects, a clear distinction to be made between the areas of intervention of the parties which must be complementary and not overlapping.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second main aim of the Commission’s proposal is to revise the financial provisions which govern the funding of political parties at European level in light of the experience acquired in the meantime. To this end, the Commission proposes, among other measures, two derogations from the no-profit rule laid down in Article 109 of the Financial Regulation. The first measure involves the possibility of carrying over up to 25% of annual total income from one year to the first quarter of the following year to enable the parties to better respond to changing political circumstances and priorities. The second measure aims to allow political parties at European level to build financial reserves by saving income generated by the parties themselves in excess of a new reduced minimum co-funding level of 15%.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must also highlight that it is proposed to establish clearly that appropriations received from the EU budget may also be used for the financing of campaigns conducted by the political parties at European level in the context of European Parliament elections, provided that this does not constitute a direct or indirect financing of national political parties or their candidates.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the Council, the proposal was initially assessed three times by the General Affairs Group, in September and October of this year, and was generally favourably received by the delegations. However, some delegations expressed concerns about the proposed legal basis and the derogations from budgetary discipline.</p>
      <p sl="pt">An opinion was requested on these issues from the Legal Service of the Council. The latter considered that the derogations from the no-profit rule laid down in Article 109(2) of Council Regulation No 1605/2002 could only be enshrined in a separate regulation based on Article 279 of the EC Treaty and intended to introduce these derogations into the Financial Regulation itself by amending it. This opinion led to the proposal being split into two legal acts and the consultation of the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On 17 October 2007, therefore recently, Coreper II debated for the first time a compromise text presented by the Portuguese Presidency and the opinion of the Legal Service of the Council. A week later, on 24 October 2007, Coreper II reached agreement on two points: firstly, the splitting of the proposal into two legal acts, one regulation based on Article 279 of the EC Treaty containing the provisions amending the Financial Regulation and one regulation containing the other provisions of the proposal based on Article 191 of the EC Treaty, and secondly, consultation of the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors on the amendment of Article 109 of Regulation No 1605/2002 in accordance with Article 279 of the EC Treaty. This consultation occurred immediately.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The two compromise texts resulting from the split were assessed by the General Affairs Group on 9 November 2007, therefore very recently. As a result, I am very pleased to announce that the General Affairs Group, which met last Friday, has confirmed the existence of broad agreement among the national delegations on the issues covered by the two regulations resulting from the split.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In essence, I would repeat that there is no significant disagreement between the three institutions. The Commission, Parliament and the Council all agree on the essentials with regard to European political foundations and the amendment of the provisions governing the functioning of European political parties. The legal basis issue was, and is, strictly a legal issue and it was not, and is not, the Council’s intention to prevent agreement between the three institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I can confirm, on behalf of the Council, that we want the two regulations resulting from the split to be adopted by the end of this year so that they can enter into force on 1 January 2008. To this end, I propose that Parliament postpones the vote on your opinion planned for this week so that, by means of the appropriate contacts, we can reach agreement at first reading on the regulation based on Article 191 of the EC Treaty, under the codecision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In that event, a Parliament opinion on the amendment of the Financial Regulation should be adopted as soon as possible. We have also asked the Court of Auditors to act promptly. We have little time but, in our opinion, there is enough time to adopt the two regulations under the conditions required by Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, from the period of reflection we learnt that there is a clear demand and opportunity for measures to reinforce and expand the political dialogue. I have always said that if we want to create a European public sphere, then we also need to create more of a European political culture, and this particular issue is absolutely crucial to doing so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certainly, there is no single magic solution to bridge the gap between European politics and our citizens and there is no simple way to meet the democratic aspirations of citizens and their desire to be more actively involved. These aspirations must be promoted by a very wide range of initiatives with common purposes to ensure the broadest possible participation of citizens, including, not least, young people, and, I would add women, in the democratic life of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The activities of European political parties, together with the creation of European political foundations, is part and parcel of building this real European public sphere, where different opinions can challenge each other and the citizens can better understand the challenges at stake and make informed choices. Political debate and political controversy are part of democracy and we hope that this will also help to increase the turnout for the European Parliament elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy to say that the Commission and Parliament have always agreed on this issue. The Commission was able to respond quickly to Parliament’s request and our proposal was also strongly supported by Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 25 October, I stated before this House my concerns that Coreper had decide to follow a route which departed from that of the Commission and Parliament, and these concerns were shared by Members, including President Pöttering and Mr Leinen. But I also expressed my hope that the key objective of the Council, Parliament and the Commission would continue to be the same: the approval of the substance of our proposal before the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Three weeks later, and having heard what the Presidency stated, I can only welcome the recent developments and express my satisfaction that we are on a common route again. The Council has been listening and the working group last Friday unanimously confirmed the full substance of our proposal. This means that we can now move on. But, even though the agreement reached in Council is an important step forward and very positive news, this is not yet the end of the process. We need to finalise the details in order to allow for a speedy adoption and entry into force of this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even if the splitting of our proposal does not ultimately affect its substance, it entails a separate, more complicated legislative procedure and an opinion from the Court of Auditors, which, I hope, will be delivered in time. The schedule is very challenging and tight.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his committed work on this file, and all the other Members involved. I also want to thank President Pöttering, the Conference of Presidents and the political groups, who played an important role in preparing the ground for an agreement on this issue. So, Madam President, President of the Council, Mr Leinen,</p>
      <p sl="pt">We can move forward together.</p>

    <intervention id="2-276" speaker_id="4262" name="Jo LEINEN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="06-04-1948" birth_place="Bisten" p_group="Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the new Lisbon Treaty is the guiding vision for parliamentary democracy at EU level. For parliamentary democracy, you need political parties. You need political parties to represent the interests of society and offer citizens a variety of candidates and manifestos to choose from at elections. In all our 27 Member States, we have parties which stand in the national elections; what we need to do now is to enable these European parties to perform their democratic work at the European level as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to ensure that in advance of the European elections too, there is a range of active political families for our citizens to choose from, which are capable of mobilising the electorate and telling voters where they are planning to take them. We want citizens to be able to decide on the nature of the Europe that they are voting for and give them a real choice. The first Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties, which we adopted back in 2004, was a resounding success. We now have ten political families which have registered, and this demonstrates the breadth of the political spectrum in the European Union. This revision of the Regulation is now designed to inject some flexibility into these democratic structures and expand them at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="de">In most of our countries, we have not only political parties but also political foundations. These are vehicles for deeper analyses of social trends and are also a forum for debate which extends beyond the party membership. These foundations have proved their worth in many countries. They do good work and so it is all the more necessary to create the opportunity to conduct this debate, this discourse, about Europe at European level too, across national borders. I therefore welcome the fact that this instrument, which is additional to the political parties themselves, has also received Council's blessing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, no political party's agenda is built around the financial year. It responds to political events, and so political parties must be treated differently from other associations. That is the purpose of this new Regulation: to inject some flexibility into financial management. We have three objectives here: firstly, we want the possibility of extending the financial year by three months on the expenditure side to enable parties to respond to political events. Secondly, we do not want parties to have to spend all their cash at the end of the year. We would like them to be able to use their own resources, membership contributions and donations to accumulate reserves which can be spent in response to key events in politics and especially, of course, on the European elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, in order to assist the smaller political families in particular but also to get the European political foundations up and running, we need different arrangements regarding the proportion of grants and own resources. We envisage setting own resources at 15% and subsidies at 85% in the new Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has decided to divide the legal basis. We argued that this was not necessary. Unfortunately, this will result in a loss of transparency, because citizens will now need to look in two places for the legal basis for this new Regulation. However, we do not wish to prolong the disagreement over legal issues. That would simply drag out the process and distract attention from the real objective of this Regulation. In the interests of the European political parties and their preparations for the 2009 European election campaign, we ought to concentrate on issues of substance and conclude this matter before the end of the year. I am very pleased to hear that the substance of this Regulation has met with widespread agreement. I think we should now do everything possible in order to wrap up this important piece of legislation under the Portuguese Presidency so that we have a legal basis for political foundations and a basis for more flexible financial management in the 2008 budget year. Transitional arrangements for this will be required from the Council, as we originally proposed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to thank you for taking the initiative on behalf of the Commission. I am grateful, too, to the Portuguese Presidency for its genuine commitment to this issue, and to Mr Leitão, with whom I did a great deal of work. I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Mathieu, for their valuable input in their reports, which introduces more transparency and more control over the allocation of these resources. We are well on track, and I hope we will get a result by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in presenting my opinion on budgetary control I highlighted the four requirements that seem essential to me: improving the control mechanisms and thereby increasing the powers of the internal and external auditors and of the authorising officer; setting up a complementary checking procedure; making a clear separation between the financial resources of the political parties and those of the foundations; and finally, clarifying the rules on the funding of campaigns for European elections.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am glad that the Council is accepting the famous 25% rule that Ingeborg Gräßle proposed last year, which the Council had rejected. We fully understand that the agreement given this year contained a significantly derogatory element that related to this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, a certain hesitancy as to the legal basis of the report leads us to doubt the outcome of the vote at the conclusion of this sitting, which is regrettable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament was very quick in drawing up this report and in delivering the opinions. It would be a pity if the Council’s decision to split the report into two parts means that we lose time. We would therefore like to see it adopted quickly before the end of the year. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, may I express my sincere congratulations and thanks to Mr Jo Leinen, the rapporteur, for doing a very good job. This report is one which my Group can fully support and we also endorse the amendments. The report turns political parties at European level, and the new instrument of political foundations, into effective tools to increase participation by Europe's citizens and boost Europe's democratic legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The referenda in France and the Netherlands showed that it is important to rebuild the trust of citizens, including via the political parties and the foundations. It is also true that the financial rules need to be adapted to the rapidly changing needs of the political parties. Transparency, of course, must be safeguarded as well. That is why the European Parliament will be providing information on the funding disbursed to parties and foundations every financial year, and this will be available on our website.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another good innovation is that the role of political parties in the context of the European elections is finally recognised. Only if Europe's parties can be actively involved in elections to the European Parliament will they become genuine players of the European polis and contribute to the formation of a European consciousness, thereby helping to overcome the democratic deficit which exists.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important component is the promotion of political foundations. Their work in the field of political information and education complements what the political parties do. These foundations have a special role to play in deepening the educational process and enhancing knowledge about the European Union, thus reducing the distance between citizens and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that foundations can boost the active participation of citizens in European political life, and they can also play an important role in the training of tomorrow's politicians. The legalistic thinking of the Council is rather hard to fathom, but as Helmut Kohl always said, the most important thing is the outcome. That is why I am in favour of this report, and I would like to thank everyone concerned for their commitment and cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my Group supports this proposal, and thinks this is a practical set of adjustments to the current legislation and that it is actually useful that European political parties should have the ability to do research and so on through their foundations and have the flexibility to carry money over from one year to the next and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was the issue of the legal base: Parliament and the Commission agreed, and the Council disagreed with us on that. But it is the substance that is more important than the legal base, and I dare even say that it is better to have legal certainty than to face a challenge later on this matter in the courts. So we are happy with that and we are happy to seek first-reading agreements with the Council by postponing the vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just add though that, for the reasons the rapporteur himself said, the European political parties are important because they express the political choices we face as a European Union. The media too often focuses only on the Council, and especially the European Council, as if it is some sort of gladiatorial combat between countries. Did Britain win today or did the French? Did the Germans make a deal with the Italians? Yet when those very same subjects come to this Parliament, you rarely see all the Members from one country voting one way and all the Members of another country voting another way, because we are making political choices – policy choices. Do we want higher environmental standards but at greater cost, or not? There will be people in every country on both sides of the argument, and the same with most of the choices we face. Political groups and political parties highlight the fact that it is political, policy choices we are making in our Union, not a combat between one national viewpoint and another national viewpoint.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why they need to be strengthened in their work; that will help citizens have a grasp for the sort of issues that we are dealing with; that will make our Union work better.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I should like to thank the Council Presidency for the progress that it is making in approaching an agreement at first reading. I trust that the Court of Auditors will be able to stir itself with unexpected alacrity to bring its opinion before us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fertile political thought is a necessary ingredient of a pluralistic, lively parliamentary democracy and this will be encouraged and stimulated by the measure before us to establish party-political foundations. It will encourage party politics to grow at European level and nascent European political parties to grow in self-confidence and to get stuck into campaigns in a purposeful way.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have to say that we have been pirouetting around the problem of political parties for several years because, of course, they are prospective rivals and competitors for the old national political parties, which, I sometimes think, will be the final citadel defended in the interests of national sovereignty. So we should proceed fast to develop platforms at European level to support and promote post-national politics which truly reflect the paradigms of the 21st century.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We are also confronted with a broader problem, however. This concerns the consequences of the funding of political parties on the quality of democracy both at Union level and at the level of individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For legal reasons, the party I represent was denied budget funding for some time during an election period. I know how very difficult it is to face a political opposition that has money when you have none. One of the largest political parties in Poland almost ceased to exist recently, threatened by the withdrawal of subsidies due to minor financial errors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Money is important, but it should not be the only factor determining the nature of the political scene, as is sometimes the case. Clearly, this is a matter for a separate debate that should be held in this House. After all, democracy cannot be dependent on funding alone.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the citizens' interest in the EU is still modest, to say the least, and this is due, among other things, to its intransparent structures, incomprehensible decisions, and a lack of media interest.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe's existing political parties have made little impact in terms of reducing this deficit, and it is not at all clear that they are actually a suitable vehicle by which to fulfil the citizens' desire for more codetermination. That, in my view, can only be achieved through more direct democracy. Repackaging the cosmetically enhanced EU Constitution as incomprehensibly as possible after a deal done behind closed doors and avoiding referenda is also certainly detrimental to the envisaged and much-vaunted objective of generating enthusiasm for the EU among the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">In light of these circumstances, European parties and their associated foundations are highly unlike to boost EU-phoria among citizens, but if they manage to improve debate at European level and communication with citizens, and represent their interests, too, we will at least have achieved something. However, their financing must be clear and transparent and, in my view, this must include auditing by independent bodies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let us be clear about Mr Leinen’s report: it is not about democracy, it is about propaganda, it is about using the taxes collected from our reluctant citizens to drive forward a European project about which they are increasingly uneasy. The Danes voted against Maastricht, the Irish voted against Nice, the Swedes against the euro, the French and Dutch against the Constitution, yet their taxes will be used to promote integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today in this Chamber, President Sarkozy spoke of European democracy, but across our diverse Member States the common public opinion necessary for representative democracy does not exist. Democracy at European level is a fraud and a delusion. By reserving funding for pan-European parties, Mr Leinen explicitly excludes Euro-sceptic parties which do not seek pan-European status, so taxpayers’ money will be channelled to integrationist parties and denied to others. In a Europe that talks about democracy, this is a crime against the people.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, today the President of France spoke to the House about the need for dialogue and debate. I think that is what we all learnt during the period of reflection, as Vice-President Wallström said.</p>
      <p sl="es">For dialogue and debate, however, we need instruments, and some of the most important and indeed essential instruments – although not the only instruments – are political parties. European political parties, like national political parties, shape the will of a people. That must also be their role in the representative institutions in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Talking about political parties at European level without talking about funding would be pointless. We must look at how those political parties, so necessary for shaping the people’s will, are funded. I think that the most important issue in relation to political parties at European level – and also at national level, but it is the European level that is of interest to us here – is that financing ought to be responsible, clear and transparent. That is what is important to the taxpayers: that their money is well spent and that there are institutions that take responsibility for the way in which their money is used.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the people of Europe, although they may have some doubts or hesitations over the direction Europe ought to take, have no doubt that their future lies in Europe. Here in Parliament, I always hear even those who are most opposed to European ideas claiming that they are European and are not against Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">To go back to what I was saying at the start, and quote Mr Sarkozy once again: debate is necessary, and for there to be debate we must create the instruments needed to organise it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore welcome the report by Mr Leinen, which takes on board the Commission proposal, and I also thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my good friend Mr Lobo Antunes, for your proposal to us.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European People’s Party will not discuss the basis here. If the regulation needs to be divided in two to find a solution that is acceptable to all, then so be it. You can count on our support.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I am glad that another fellow Member will be listening to the discussion, particularly on this issue, in our beautiful language.</p>
      <p sl="el">It seems to me that we could use political parties here, which are valuable tools. Alas, we are keeping these valuable tools hidden away in our institutional cupboard where they are in danger of getting rusty. Most if not all of us are agreed on the democratic role that political parties should play in Europe, but I think we should also agree that they have not been playing this role as yet. This is because today’s parties, as several speakers have said, are not really political parties. They are loose confederations of parties, as Dimitris Tsatsos, my teacher and rapporteur at the time, said in his report as long ago as 1996. We have no real political parties, and this discussion is a good opportunity for us to see if we can establish real political parties at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="el">I have two comments on specific topics in the report under discussion. The report makes two significant advances. As we have said, it does not solve all the political problems, but there are two major advances. One is that now we recognise how the political institutions operate, an element of thought comes into our discussion. A vital element of ideological ferment has been introduced. One of the very problems of democracy in the EU is precisely that we do not engage in rigorous and serious political thought, and these institutes can supply this need.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second major advance is transparency. This is especially evident in the transparency rules laid down for the parties themselves, but above all, I would say, with the new Article 9(b) on the transparency rules for Parliament itself.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me conclude with a brief comment on the issue of the fragmentation of the legal basis. I understand that there are technical problems here. Personally, I regret this fragmentation. The point is, if we all agree that from an economic point of view independence and transparency are integral parts of the political mechanism itself, would a single legal mechanism not be far more powerful?</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am favourably disposed towards this resolution in that it assists the democratic life of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Group of the European Left, which is about to hold its second congress, have always said that globalisation, and also this Europe of ours, has seen a coming-together of markets, business interests and red-tape, while democracy has lagged behind. That is all well and good for strong powers, but not for those of us who believe in a different type of society catering for the needs of its weakest members.</p>
      <p sl="it">This was the role of mass parties in the past. Today there is a fresh challenge, namely to establish parties capable of coping with new levels of conflict and decision-making; parties which rebuild democratic participation and a democratic role for Parliament, outside the system of broad coalitions and intergovernmental cooperation that stifles democratic debate. There is of course a need for transparency in the use of funds, but politics cannot be the sole prerogative of the rich.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Leinen. Mr Leinen is one of the fathers of this Regulation and a tireless defender of political parties, with whom I have shared the odd battle to secure agreements, one might say.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal could not and cannot be the prisoner of battles between the legal services of the Community institutions. We must reach an agreement sooner rather than later because, if we fail to do so, the only victims in this conflict will be the political parties, who play a vital role in bringing the EU nearer to the citizens and encouraging them to get involved in politics so that they feel part of a common political project and a political future.</p>
      <p sl="es">The parties also represent the transnational dimension of the EU’s process of political integration. This report shows Parliament’s flexibility and operational capacity. This House cannot be accused of failing to cooperate to reach an agreement at first reading before the end of 2007.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to set out three ideas, three basic improvements to this project, which we welcome and which will ensure the development of the parties and the foundations.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first is the vital role of European political parties in elections to the European Parliament, reflected in the possibility of using the financial allocation for European election campaigns.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second is the independent management of European political parties, with the transfer of annual reserves, and the possibility of creating reserves from own resources over several years.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly and finally, encouraging political foundations on a European scale enhances the activity of the European political parties. The foundations are a vital instrument for extending the action of the political parties and strengthening links to citizens, and they will play a major role in terms of information, debate and political training.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, our Group is divided on this. I represent those who do not believe that the Europarties make for greater democracy. They are parties of parties and with them power gets further away from the people. They deliver centralised policies decided by the big parties in the big countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">They can use Europarty funds to spread centralised propaganda in the European elections at national level. They receive Europarty funds to promote European awareness among the people. The aim of centralised power is to make people adopt a more sympathetic attitude towards it – to make them submissive.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A new agent of propaganda is now being proposed in the shape of a legal basis for special European foundations, reducing the extent to which the Europarties are self-funded and allowing them to escape compliance with the Financial Regulations to which others are obliged to conform.

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I am not an anti-federalist. I believe that federalism is a good form of government in Germany, Canada, Switzerland and the USA. However, it requires a people, and there is still not a European people that is prepared for a European democracy. Since I was first elected, participation in elections has fallen from 63% to 46% most recently. Next time this figure will probably fall below 40%. The European media are very few in number and small. They live off artificial subsidies. There are no common parties with members who have signed themselves up, who voluntarily pay their membership fees and who are involved in the creation of election programmes. The parties are controlled by the national parties and financed by the taxpayers. They now want more money and the opportunity to use it in national elections. This distorts equal competition, is unfair and is probably unlawful because it is in breach of the principle of equality.</p>
      <p sl="da">Party support is being managed by members of the largest parties; my party has lost its subsidies because an individual signature is required from one of our members, even though not all the members of other parties have signed for their membership individually. We are being treated differently, yet there is no critical press that raises cases involving discrimination. I would gladly vote for subsidies for European political parties if the electorate wanted a European democracy. Begin by giving the elected people’s representatives power over the legislative process, and take the power away from the government officials and lobbyists, so that the electorate can make a difference by turning out on election day and voting for a different party. Create living parties with direct membership and voluntary membership fees, so that we can then arrange the public aid which the electorate deems reasonable and which is not discriminatory. Currently, we hardly have the support of the electorate for any further pressure on the citizens’ purse.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Wallström ended her initial speech in this debate by expressing the wish that we move forward together. The conclusion that I have drawn from this debate is that we are effectively moving forward together. This can only be good news for the Council and the Portuguese Presidency and I must thank the Commission and the European Parliament for the fact that we can move forward together based on the proposal which I have presented to you today.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As has already been said, the form is not so important; what is truly important is the substance. The substance in this case is to provide the European political parties with additional resources so that they can fully carry out their political activities and exercise their competences and so that they can fully involve all our citizens in this fascinating process of European construction.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is the real substance, the real reason and the real issue. As I have said, I can only rejoice that the three institutions have been able to reach agreement on how to move forward in this regard. I must also say, if you will allow me to be frank, that the fact that we could reach this agreement during the Portuguese Presidency is for me and for the Portuguese Government naturally a key aspect of our Presidency, which is rapidly coming to an end.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must say three things to you. Firstly, we hope that we will soon receive the opinion of the Court of Auditors and that we will therefore be able to achieve a rapid conclusion in this respect. Secondly, it was said here today by a Member that there were some European political parties that would be excluded from the scope of the new regulations: that is not the case as all are eligible. Finally, I want to very sincerely reiterate our commitment to do everything we can to conclude this process by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I feel that the Commission’s recommendation is important and shows the way forward. The European political parties play an important role in politics at European level. They have a big role not only in European political life but also in the creation of a European public sector in the broadest sense, so I feel that their role and the redefinition of their activities are topical.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is a central question whether we should support the initiatives of these European political parties in the interests of encouraging citizens to participate consciously in the democratic life of the Union, and in its creation. I trust that there is demand and an opportunity for measures to reinforce and extend political dialogue: ensuring the most widespread participation possible of citizens in the democratic life of the Union, not least including young people, in order to ensure that everyone is heard.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to mention here that one of the political goals decided for the European Union is still the promotion and advancement of the creation of a European public life. In order to do this, one of the elements emphasised in the Commission’s document is support for political foundations at European level that provide assistance or support and supplement the activities of groups of political parties that are close to them, through various initiatives such as, for example, organising European seminars, training and conferences.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, European-level foundations like this can ensure an efficient financial framework for cooperation between national political foundations and teachers at European level, including other representatives of youth organisations and civil society.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 36 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0778/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Effects of the value of the euro on competitive tourism</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given that the increased value of the euro has led to a loss of competitiveness for Europe's tourist industry, what measures is the Commission planning to strengthen the industry and uphold Europe's standing as a tourist destination?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-300" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, euro exchange rate trends do of course affect the relative price of European tourism products for consumers from third countries. Although the euro exchange rate is not a political instrument, but is formed freely on the foreign exchange market, the consequences of the recent rises in the euro-dollar exchange rate on tourism should be viewed on a differentiated basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all, fluctuations in the euro exchange rate have very little impact on tourism flows within the European Union. According to the available data, 70% of revenue comes from cross-border tourism in the European Union, in other words, from tourists from other EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we should not be focusing solely on the euro-dollar exchange rate. Calculations of the effective euro exchange rate show that the overall trend is far less dramatic. The euro's rise against the Chinese yuan, for example, was much less pronounced this year, and yet revenue from tourists from non-EU countries barely doubled in the years between 1995 and 2005, whereas the revenue attributable to tourists from China increased twelve-fold over the same period.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission is aware that price is a key competition factor. Nonetheless, the Commission's vision for European tourism in the future, as presented in its recently adopted communication, is based on high quality, not low cost.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are convinced that even with a strong euro, Europe will still be the world's number one destination if Europe makes the best possible use of its advantages: its heritage, its beautiful natural environment, its geographical concentration of attractive sites and its reputation for a high level of service.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the Commissioner’s last statements are at odds with reality. What is happening at this moment in time is that a large slice of intra-European tourism is heading for countries outside the European zone – the Caribbean, the developing world, the Far East, Africa – largely due to this increase in the value of our European currency.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, there are plans to introduce new measures that will also work against European tourism, such as compensation to businesses arising from CO2 emissions. In other words, it would appear that there are many factors jeopardising European tourism, and there does not currently seem to be any indication of a European policy concerning tourism. This is apparently still an issue for national governments, and I wish to ask the Commissioner whether he feels that the Commission can encourage some kind of European policy to counteract this obvious trend towards a decrease in the competitiveness of European tourism.</p>

    <intervention id="2-302" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">I am afraid that the honourable Member and I may have to agree to disagree. As you know, just a few days ago a major European tourism conference was held in Portugal and all these issues were discussed in detail there. The conference brought together 500 leading specialists from all over Europe and I did not have the impression from that conference that the European tourism industry or, indeed, the Member States are worried about Europe losing its lustre as a tourist destination.</p>
      <p sl="de">The figures we have available do not bear out what the honourable Member has said, namely that we are facing a particularly serious situation. Let me say again: of course exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on price, but what Europe offers visitors from other countries is not determined primarily by price. The decision to travel to Europe is not a decision which is influenced mainly by price but by the quality of what Europe has to offer.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, I agree with the honourable Member that we must pay very close attention to the burdens placed on the European tourism industry and ensure that framework conditions are put in place that allow this industry to capitalise in real terms on the massive growth and employment potential that it has to offer.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 40 by Bart Staes (H-0786/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: European Development Days - Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The opening of the European Development Days (EDD) between 7 and 9 November will be attended by Mr Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, President of the Maldives. This has been made possible by the fact that the Maldives are seriously threatened by climate change and because 'Climate change and development' is the main theme of the EDD. On the other hand, this involves the EU's legitimising this President and his regime. International human rights organisations severely criticise President Gayoom because of the autocratic nature of his regime and the many serious human rights violations by his country's police and security services.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Why has the Commission invited Mr Maumoon Abdul Gayoom (after all, there are other countries which are threatened by climate change but where more democratic governments are in power), and what is the Commission's attitude towards his regime in the Maldives?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-305" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Thank you very much for your question, which gives me an opportunity to highlight the situation in the Maldives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom stressed at the recent United Nations Summit, the Maldives, which are no more than 1.5 metres above sea level, are threatened by the continuous rise in the level of the oceans as a result of climate warming. This has forced more than 300 000 refugees to leave the islands. Therefore, as the honourable Member has quite rightly pointed out, inviting the President of the Maldives gives us an opportunity to highlight the danger that now threatens the people of those islands.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the Maldives have always played an active role in international conferences on less-developed countries and small island developing countries. This diligence was confirmed when the Maldives attended the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which was hosted by the European Parliament in 2001, and again when the Maldives took on the important role of chairing the group of experts at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the political situation in the Maldives is concerned, and in line with the statement by the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Commission welcomes the recent political developments in the Maldives and is pleased with the reforms that have been introduced to date. The publication of the roadmap for the reform programme in 2006 was indeed good news. The elections due to be held next year, in 2008, will be an important step towards greater democracy. The Commission is ready to lend its support to the reform process, including the provision of special assistance for the 2008 elections.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course we remain vigilant when it comes to the issue of human rights. The Commission has been satisfied with the recent improvements, including the release last year of two important activists: Jennifer Latheef and Mohammed Nasheed.</p>

I think that we must be very careful in that respect and must not offer him a platform unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As for the other points, I do not of course underestimate the problems facing the Maldives. I think that they merit a great deal of attention, but once again we must be politically wise.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I can understand the question and the remarks of the honourable Member, but there is no doubt whatsoever that climate change will mainly affect the most vulnerable countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is vital that the Bali negotiations provide a launch pad for a process that incorporates this fact and that the most vulnerable countries themselves become aware of it. The three essential groups involved, which come under the United Nations, the G-77 and the European Union, are the LDC group, the ‘small island developing countries’ group and the ‘overseas countries and territories’ group. We have invited all three to our European Development Days. The Maldives head the LDC working group on climate change at the United Nations, so this invitation was not motivated by any other reason.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the last Development Day, which was devoted to conclusions, the Deputy Minister of Cuba also gave an address from the platform. Following his intervention I was obliged to put some matters straight, for some of the things he said were clearly inappropriate and at the very least inopportune. I used this opportunity to point out that democracy still had its benefits since it allowed people to express freely what they thought, including things that were sometimes shocking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore understand your comments only too well, but in this case it is somewhat difficult to ignore the Maldives, when it is a country that typifies a situation of real vulnerability.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The rapid growth of urban areas is a continuing trend in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the course of recent years the number of people living in towns and cities has increased considerably. Of the developing countries, Africa is also the region that has seen greater urban growth than anywhere else in the world. Its urban population has tripled over the last 25 years and is set to double again by 2030.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This huge demographic shift has resulted in the rapid spread of shantytowns and unhealthy slums, often on difficult terrain, on the fringes of the cities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Job insecurity, the informal market for housing and land and the lack of specialist services are all problems that particularly affect the poorest urban dwellers and are indicators of how capable these urban areas are to provide a secure environment for the local population and for growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Combating poverty in the context of the Millennium Development Goals is a key objective of the Commission’s development policy and is something that guides the Commission in all its initiatives in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission supports durable urban development through good governance and good urban management. Aid to urban areas is provided as part of the fight against poverty and improvements to the quality of life of those living in shantytowns are therefore delivered in the context of a global approach that is based on better urban management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission’s urban strategy seeks to help those living in shantytowns by way of a series of programmes that are implemented in the various geographical areas covered by our development programmes. This includes Latin America, which has benefited from the URB-AL Programme, and Asia, which has its own Asia Urbs Programme.</p>
      <a text="(The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)"/>
      <p sl="fr">It is a long answer, and I am a little afraid that Members will not be patient to listen until the end of my speech, but I will speak more slowly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission provides financial aid for various groups from the African, Caribbean and Pacific states. This is directed at global initiatives and programmes aimed at improving the shantytowns, namely the ‘Cities Alliance’ and the UN programme ‘UN-Habitat’. The aim of the Cities Alliance is to enhance the impact and the effectiveness of cooperation on urban development by improving the living conditions of the urban poor and developing programmes for improving the shantytowns to urban and national standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission became involved in the Cities Alliance in 2007. This initiative focuses on poor towns and on the poor people who live in them. The ultimate goal is to promote sustainable urban development. The Commission uses the Alliance to encourage an inclusive and participative approach to urban development and to promote its objectives for the improvement of the shantytowns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2007 the Commission approved a grant of EUR 4 million from the ninth European Development Fund to support a regional programme for the modernisation of the shantytowns. This programme is aimed at improving dialogue, promoting regional, national and local exchanges and sharing experiences on political measures for the improvement of shantytown areas. The programme provides financial support for regional shantytown improvement plans, feasibility studies and the strengthening of existing facilities and resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has been particularly active in its efforts to improve the conditions of those living in shantytowns, especially as regards the provision of water and sanitation. Improving access to water and sanitation in urban and semi-urban areas is clearly an integral part of our sectoral policy. In the specific case of the urban poor, special emphasis is placed on improving the performance of those who operate and provide decentralised and municipal services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Africa, where the majority of public and municipal services perform poorly, the general organisation and financial management of this sector needs to be reformed in order to improve the level of supply, especially if this area is to attract investment. These public services have to be strengthened, especially when it comes to the setting of tariffs, the collection of payments and the operational aspects associated with maintaining the system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You know that we have also established a Water Facility, which is funded through the ninth European Development Fund and which provides the poor and most vulnerable citizens living in urban and semi-urban areas with access to water and sanitation. There have been two calls for proposals aimed at providing the poorest and most vulnerable with access to water and sanitation services. Some 175 projects have been implemented on the basis of a Commission allocation of EUR 416 million for all the ACP regions concerned. Out of this total there have been 38 projects for actions in urban areas and 29 for actions in semi-urban areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Water is the focal point of most of these projects, with this facility being supported by drainage and sanitation services. A total of some EUR 191.7 million has already been invested in the Water Facility for urban and semi-urban zones. Because of the impoverished status of a large number of the beneficiaries living in the shantytowns and poorest parts of the zones concerned, most, if not all, of the projects provide some form of benefit to the poor in that tariff adjustments are included as part of the package.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Something else that I might add as I near the end of this long narrative that has been arranged for me is that I met the UN-Habitat Executive Director and had a lengthy conversation with her. I used this meeting primarily to enlist her support in the preparation of the Development Days due to be held towards the end of next year. The main topic will be local powers and decentralisation – this being one of the main themes, the second being media and development – and I asked her to join us in preparing this theme because the question of extreme densification in town centres and capital cities is a real development issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this connection, and this is something that I particularly wanted to talk about, there is also the serious problem of land use planning in the developing nations, and this issue should provide us with a new central theme for our development policy. We are working very hard on this and I will probably be making a statement on this specific subject – namely land use planning in the developing countries – in the near future because it is an issue of real importance. Take Kinshasa, for example, which is a city of more than six million people. It is now all too evident that Kinshasa has become unmanageable in terms of security, the provision of services, sanitation projects and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore very aware of the relevance of the question raised by the honourable Member.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I apologise for the difficulties. I did take the question for Mr Mitchell because I knew he was on his way down.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, in that lengthy answer, I am not sure I heard you once mention the words ‘rural’, ‘agriculture’ or ‘the need for investment’, because the problem with slums is that 900 million people are rushing to them for a better life, because there is nothing better in the rural areas. I think you need to address the issue of investing in agriculture and rural development in the developing world so that we do not create even greater slums.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-320" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">You are probably right, but I just had the opportunity to deal with this issue of rural development only recently.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You will be aware of the fact that the tenth European Development Fund places greater emphasis on rural development and investment in agriculture than the ninth EDF, for example, where the budget allocated for projects on rural development and agriculture represented – if I remember correctly – 9% of the appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the tenth European Development Fund this proportion has risen to just over 12%. The EUR 666 million provided under the ninth European Development Fund has now been increased to EUR 1.1 billion in the tenth Fund. It goes without saying that we are encouraging this development and I agree with you in stating that this is one of the best responses to the problem; the same goes for land use planning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Developing agriculture is obviously an effective way to ease congestion in the town centres, to give the poor people who now inhabit the urban centres the chance of a better life and to attract them back to the land. We also need to have infrastructures that provide improved access and interconnectivity and better social and sanitation services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore working on all these issues and I share your viewpoint even though I have not touched on that particular question. There are other solutions that may be put forward, but you are entirely right and rest assured that we will be placing it high on our list of priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During the European Development Days this question was dealt with in some detail by Kofi Annan, who has set up a foundation to aid rural regions and develop agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I ask the Commissioner if he is aware that target 11 of the Millennium Development Goals seeks to significantly improve the lives of 100 million people living in slums by 2020? And there are, in fact, something like 900 million people – at least the question said 900 million and I do not think the Commissioner questioned that – living in urban slums?</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner will be at the EU-ACP Assembly in Rwanda later this month. Will he be in a position to give any indication to the Assembly there, or when will he be in a position to give an indication to the Assembly here, of precise statistics on the way to reaching this objective? You said that you will come back with a plan, you will come back with a report, but will that report give us precise details on how this objective of taking 100 million people out of slum dwellings will be achieved?</p>

      <p sl="fr">There will be statistics but these are national figures, when we get them and when the data collection systems are reliable. In any case, as things stand at present I am unable to guarantee that we will be in possession of the complete set of statistics on this particular subject; all the more because the definitions vary enormously from country to country. We are therefore working on this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Normally when we carry out an assessment and when I present an account of it we are already in possession – I hope – of a certain number of elements that enable us to shed some light on the information you requested. However, I dare not promise you today that we will have reliable and precise figures in this case. This is one of the factors that we are currently working on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have already trawled through the information held by other international organisations. The data obtained are usually far from complete and often questionable, because the rudiments that we have and the methods used to quantify these statistics are not always reliable.</p>

      <p sl="lt">People have left villages for towns in search for work. What measures will be taken, what projects are to be implemented in the countries to ensure that not only agricultural areas, not only rural areas would be getting support, so that new workplaces are created in other regions as well? I happened to hear that, for example, in Mozambique just 5% of aid funds are allocated for the development of infrastructure and workplaces. Do you consider this sufficient?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-324" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the action programmes are funded as a rule by the development programmes, not through humanitarian aid. They are therefore not humanitarian aid programmes. In some regions we are funding employment-intensive work programmes, especially in post-conflict countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and the DRC. We are providing finance for a whole series of labour-intensive programmes, including road construction and upgrading, small-scale maintenance projects and so on, that will provide people with work. This is a starting point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I shall take advantage of your question to point out again – you may like it or you may not, you may have an opinion or not, but as this is an open debate I am going to say it anyway – that what the Commission is trying to do at present by way of the economic partnership agreements that we are currently attempting to conclude with various regions in the developing world is essentially aimed at generating a certain dynamic process and developing a private sector that will be capable of supporting employment, creating wealth and prosperity and, especially, ensuring that the developing countries are gradually able to open up their markets in order to take advantage of the most positive effects – and I know only too well that there are not just positive effects – of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, I am always very surprised to note that in this House, too, there are many who are opposed to the signing of economic partnership agreements. When you realise that a 1% increase in trade in Africa is equivalent to two and a half times the entire amount of public aid allocated to development in that continent then you will understand that there will never be sustainable development in the poorest nations unless their economy is more prosperous. In reply to your question I can assure you that we do have emergency response measures, including those for post-conflict periods, and that we are trying to implement them. We are in fact funding employment schemes and labour-intensive projects. These are immediate responses. These are emergency situations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Apart from that, the ‘aid for trade’ policies are the only ones that can eventually create employment and lasting employment at that. There is no other miracle cure. It is not realistic to suggest that we should be financing job creation schemes, for example, and indeed I have already heard such a proposal. In some countries 60% or 70% of the population are below the age of 25. You cannot create public works jobs for such a huge mass of people. The only response to this problem must be economic in nature.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are therefore two aspects to this question. The first is agriculture, which is an important element because it creates lasting employment and provides food for the entire family. It is perhaps true to say that we have not invested enough in the agricultural sector in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second element, clearly, is the economy. It is essential to establish and consolidate integrated regional markets in order to create the conditions in which the local population can take advantage of globalisation and economic growth.</p>

    <intervention id="2-328" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Helping the governments of developing countries and improving transport safety, and that includes road safety, is one of the Commission’s priorities for cooperation on development in the transport sector. This is reflected in the Commission’s policies. The need for policies aimed at promoting transport safety is a key aspect of our ongoing sectoral dialogue with partner governments and internal directives now recommend that certain safety measures should be incorporated when drawing up road projects funded by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">An assessment of Commission interventions in the transport sector of developing countries, which was completed in 2004, notes that the majority of road projects did take account of safety aspects. To give some concrete examples, most road construction schemes included road-signs and markings and designated speed limits, and many of the projects also proposed widening the roadside verges so as to permit the safe passage of non-motorised vehicles and pedestrians.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In certain countries the Commission has also funded actions aimed specifically at road safety, such as the drafting of a highway code and the equipping of vehicle test centres, notably in Albania, and the introduction of rules for vehicle safety testing in Mali. A project currently under way in Cameroon is helping to fund various construction schemes, including the installation of crash barriers to improve safety on the main Douala-Yaoundé road, as well as a road safety awareness campaign.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly we can do more. Progress depends first and foremost on the commitment displayed by the partner government in highlighting road safety issues, collecting and analysing accident figures, introducing rules and regulations, defining standards and setting-up and strengthening the organisations responsible for the general implementation of road safety policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as the Commissioner will be aware, the European Transport Safety Council publishes on a regular basis very useful reports in relation to road safety standards statistics and the general performance of various countries. It shows quite clearly that the countries of Eastern Europe, and, unfortunately, my own country Ireland, lag way down at the bottom of the list. Would the Commissioner agree that the major problem is that accidents which are designated as accidents are not accidents at all? They are, in fact, a result of excessive speed, a result of poor road standards, and a result, in many cases, of excessive alcohol. We know that there is a common European driving licence coming in 2013, so I would like to ask the Commissioner whether there is any prospect that this common European driving licence could in fact be front-loaded and be brought on more quickly. Secondly, would the Commissioner agree that when somebody goes from one Member State to another Member State as a driver and they have a valid driving licence, should they not be obliged to take a theory test in relation to the rules of the road, signage and various other elements within the particular country that they are now residing in?</p>

In his discussions with the countries of South Asia, has the Commissioner suggested that the European Union – with all the advice that, perhaps, Mr Higgins could give from the Republic of Ireland and other countries – could assist them in improving their road safety, improving, perhaps, a reference to a highway code that does not exist, and help to reduce mortality on their roads?</p>

This is something we are doing. As far as roads are concerned, it is true that in certain locations, especially where we know that there is a lot of pedestrian traffic, we also try to upgrade the roadside verges and include accident prevention in our road safety projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In global terms, and as part of the political dialogue, we include all these questions, but the message that we occasionally send to our partners should state that they too need to address these political issues. When I hear this type of question I always wonder: ‘Are we going to be asked to do everything for them?’. We cannot be called upon to do everything. We can inspire and suggest, we can provide funding and aid, but we cannot govern in the place of those whose job it is to govern. It is like picking presents off a Christmas tree. People expect development cooperation to be able to do anything and everything.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You must also understand that with the budget resources available to me I must focus on the main priorities. Mr Mitchell quite rightly highlighted the Millennium Development Goals. They are the main priorities. We are ready to help and we are providing funding, but the partner countries have to ask for it. This is one of the conditions. During the dialogue process we sometimes try to suggest this kind of thing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Bowis is not here, but I can tell you, for example, that in implementing our development policies I try to instil in our partners an ever greater awareness for the situation of the disabled. The problems affecting disabled persons are not generally taken into account by the partner countries or by the partner governments. We therefore have a whole series of parallel initiatives and policies that we are trying to put forward and implement, but do not forget that we can only fund these projects if the partner country makes an approach or places a request.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given that the European Union funds a large number of road building and road infrastructure projects, this particular aspect – and certainly the issue of road safety – obviously crops up frequently in such debates and discussions.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Statistics show that the losses incurred because of accidents and their consequences in EU countries constitute about 2% of the GDP of the European Union, which means these losses are huge. Do we have similar figures for the Third World and developing countries? Is the percentage higher or lower? Apparently, they have fewer cars in these countries, so maybe that percentage is lower. While fully realising that the Commission cannot do everything for the countries in question, I would like to know if these countries draw from the experience of the European Union, where, during the last five years, the number of accidents has fallen by 50 percent.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I agree, I agree. However, I simply do not have the resources to count up the number of road accidents in the developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore have to go by what the governments tell me. It is obvious that accidents are happening, but the lower traffic density and the smaller number of vehicles means, for example, that there are many more accidents occurring at the workplace, in the fields and so on. What is clear is that a very large number of accidents happen at the workplace.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards road accidents, I can only go by the figures that I get from our partner countries, if indeed I get any at all. Now if you ask me to fund statistics projects I will be extremely reluctant because I think that we do not have the resources to engage in micromanagement on behalf of our partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that we have to focus on the big picture if we are to be effective; there is no other solution. If we start ‘micromanaging’ all the small details we will lose our policy direction, we will be into everything, we will no longer have a real strategy or a system to adhere to, there will be no more cohesion, there will be none of these things.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The questions that you have posed are clearly good ones and it is right and proper to raise these matters in our dialogue with partners, However, I must tell you that things are not as straightforward when it comes to arousing the interest and the attention of our partners in these areas. I have therefore promised Mr Bowis – who happens not to be here, but I made him a promise at least two years ago and I will keep it now just to be methodical – that we would include the category ‘disabled persons’ alongside our policies on gender equality and children’s rights. However, I can assure you that it is not as simple on the ground. Things are not nearly as clear-cut and each time we have to try and try again. I fully agree with everything that you have said, but I cannot do things for our partner countries that they, clearly, do not seem ready to do just yet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is therefore pressing home all these points, which are relevant issues, but it cannot go so far as to micromanage everything.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the meeting of the two leaders on 5 September this year and the agreement on the need for the earliest start of the process leading to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. Our aim is that serious negotiations on a comprehensive settlement under the auspices of the United Nations should begin without unnecessary delay. The agreement of 8 July 2006 between the leaders of the two communities on the island should prepare the ground for such talks as a means of facilitating the full resumption of these talks for a comprehensive settlement.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the question of financial aid used by the end of September this year, the total amount contracted under the aid programme for the Turkish Cypriot community came to EUR 24 million – that is, 9% of the total – and the amount tendered came to EUR 44 million. A great share of the programme is devoted to infrastructure investments, which require more time to prepare and for which the bulk of payments will take place in the latter part of the programming period, which is due to last until December 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Notwithstanding the challenges that are posed by the unique political, diplomatic and legal status, the Commission considers that the implementation of the aid programme is broadly on track for the moment.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Union is preparing to assume a greater role in post-status Kosovo. Ongoing status negotiations notwithstanding, significant preparations are being made for the future International Civilian Office and an ESDP mission of rule of law for Kosovo.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is financing CSFP joint actions establishing planning teams in Pristina. These teams have developed the blueprints for the future missions on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan. However, the final shape of the future international missions will depend on the exact outcome of status negotiations. The Commission has worked in close cooperation with the two teams in order to ensure a coherent overall EU presence in a post-status Kosovo.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation in facilitating the financing of these very important missions. The Commission fully supports the work of the international Troika which is currently leading the negotiations and there is the deadline of 10 December for the Troika activities as confirmed by the contact group ministerial in New York in September. At this point in time it is too early to speculate when exactly Kosovo’s status will be resolved but it is clear that prolonging the agony will not serve anybody’s purpose. On our behalf, we are ready to turn every stone and even more in order to achieve a negotiated solution which would be best for everybody. We ask that from both sides and from our partners in the international community, while at the same time, of course, we are preparing ourselves for better or worse scenarios as regards Kosovo’s status.</p>

      <p sl="de">Many thanks for your good answer, Commissioner. There are two points which I would like to make. Firstly, as you know, this House voted by a 75% majority in favour of internationally monitored independence for Kosovo on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan. We voted against plans for the division of Kosovo and against any reversion to rule by Belgrade. I would like to know whether the Commission endorses this position.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, like you, I was in Belgrade last week, and as you have said, the longer the decision-making process takes, the more destabilising the effect on Serbia will be. Serbia too needs a swift decision in order to be able to pursue its course towards a future in Europe.</p>

That is the first concrete step of Serbia towards the European Union. On the condition that Serbia will achieve full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, then we and the Member States can sign the agreement which will then become the gateway for candidate status for Serbia.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 49 by Michl Ebner (H-0805/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Accession negotiations with Croatia</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In June 2004, Croatia was finally accorded the status of an official candidate for membership by the EU. October 2005 marked the official start of accession negotiations, during the course of which the first 12 chapters have so far been opened. Croatia itself aspires to complete the negotiations by 2008/2009. In view of the positive developments in Croatia in the field of the market economy, the Rule of Law, democracy and human rights this would seem a perfectly feasible deadline. However, it is uncertain whether the EU can keep to this date, since objections have been raised to the effect that enlargement cannot take place without an institutional reform of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What, in the Commission’s estimation, is the status of the accession negotiations? What support is the Commission giving (or planning to give) to ensure that Croatia can join the EU as soon as possible?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-349" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Accession negotiations with Croatia are at cruising speed for the moment. As you may recall, the talks began on 3 October 2005 or, to be precise, 4 October, because it was late at night or early in the morning, depending on the definition in Luxembourg. The screening process was completed one year later, in October 2006, and all 33 screening reports have been submitted to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current state of play is that negotiations have been opened on 14 chapters out of 35, and closed on two chapters. We are moving forward at a steady pace. I would like to add that, on 10 chapters, we have agreed opening benchmarks – or they have been agreed by the Council, to be more precise – which have been communicated to Croatia. For the moment, we consider only the opening benchmark on justice, freedom and security to be met. However, we hope that the work being done by Croatia to meet opening benchmarks will allow us to recommend opening negotiations on a further one or two chapters rather soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, what is most important in terms of the next steps is more progress on the most difficult chapters. This mainly concerns those chapters where opening benchmarks have been set. Ultimately, the pace of Croatia’s progress towards the European Union will be determined by its own ability to meet all the necessary conditions on the basis of its own merits.</p>

In my opinion, the progress made is certainly satisfactory, but more could still be done. As far as I am concerned – and I am a member of the European Union-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee – it is the Croatians who are pushing, but they are not getting a positive response from the European Commission.

      <p sl="en">I agree that there is a need for further action in the first place by Croatia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just to illustrate the challenges: the technical negotiations form the superstructure of the negotiations on the acquis communautaire, while the reforms on the ground form the substructure – the foundation – of the negotiations. In many areas, for Croatia or for Turkey or for any other future candidate country, it is clear that, in order to meet certain opening benchmarks for technical negotiations, we have to first make progress on the reforms on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">The concrete example that I have in mind is shipbuilding and steel. We will be able to recommend opening a chapter on competition policy and state aid, which is one of the core chapters of EU legislation, once we see that Croatia has convincingly started to implement and achieved results in the structural reforms related to the shipbuilding and steel sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore it is, in the first place, in the hands of the Croatian Government and Parliament to make progress on these reforms and thus facilitate progress in the technical negotiations.</p>

Croatia will be a member of the European Union in a few years and, therefore, for this period up to the time when Croatia is able to join the Schengen arrangement, as a member of the European Union, we will have the arrangement to which the honourable Member referred.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, as regards substance, a common standard already exists – at least a minimum standard – as all Member States are bound by international human rights conventions.

      <p sl="it">In cases where undeclared employment affects the most vulnerable groups - the case you have brought up - such as children who are recruited illegally and then exploited, I have proposed prison sentences. Black market exploitation of particularly vulnerable groups, which is the case of children, is the most serious case of all in my opinion. Not all EU Member States currently have very rigorous penalties for employers who illegally exploit the labour of children or women, and I believe that we need such legislation at European level.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, where education or training for illegal child immigrants is concerned, we are talking about a highly sensitive issue. We also know that there is no method which is off limits to human trafficking organisations. Do you not see a certain risk that children may be sent on ahead so that parents are then able to join them through the process of family reunification, thus simply accelerating illegal immigration?</p>
      <p sl="de">As much as I welcome efforts to cushion the effects on children, I do see a risk that this could give further impetus to illegal immigration.</p>

Greater vigilance is needed because like you I am convinced that it is extremely important to monitor the activities of private organisations involved in looking after these children or in putting forward seemingly attractive proposals for the provision of education and so on, some of which may be a front for illegal activities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is for this reason that we have focused special attention on this issue when implementing the European strategy for preventing and combating the trafficking in human beings in general and the most vulnerable in particular, especially children. I have included in my proposal for a European strategy on children’s rights a special clause on the activities of private organisations, which have to be monitored when they are being entrusted with the care of children.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 57 by Sarah Ludford (H-0791/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Entry-exit scheme</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In recent correspondence Commissioner Frattini has said that any proposal for an entry-exit system would be made only in early 2008 once the results of two current studies were available. However, it has subsequently been reported in the press that Commissioner Frattini at the informal meeting of EU justice and interior ministers in early October called for a register of biometric identifiers of all non-EU citizens entering and leaving.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How has Commissioner Frattini been able to announce already an EU entry-exit scheme when there has been no communication from the Commission yet giving an assessment of the feasibility studies?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-363" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">As the honourable Member knows, the Portuguese Presidency included the topic of new technologies and integrated border management for discussion at the informal Council of Interior Ministers on 1 October.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency presented ideas in relation to increasing security as well as in relation to facilitating travel. I participated, obviously, in the Council’s discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe will need to make effective use of the great opportunities new technologies provide in the area of border control. Advancements made in biometric technologies will allow for speedier and more reliable identification of travellers. As a concrete example of steps taken by the Union so far, the introduction of biometric passports and the development of the Visa Information System (VIS) and Schengen Information System II (SIS II) will pave the way for increased use of biometrics at borders. We have, of course, been cooperating very closely with Parliament on both these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Transforming border processes cannot happen overnight. A step-by-step approach is needed, therefore. It is important to first implement what is already planned before embarking on even more ambitious projects. But it is necessary to develop and maintain a long-term strategy and vision, accompanied by a thorough cost-benefit analysis.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the beginning of next year, I will present a communication, not a legislative proposal, outlining how an entry-exit system and a registered travellers programme might look. The communication will evaluate the different options and their impact, including with regard to data protection and other fundamental rights. An entry-exit system and a registered travellers programme should be seen together as part of the same package of measures. Simplifying checks for bona fide travellers allows us to focus resources on high-risk travellers. Faster border checks for bona fide travellers can offset the impact on border crossing times resulting from an entry-exit system.</p>
      <p sl="en">When implementing such automated system synergies with the business processes and the equipment for SIS II and VIS, we need to examine carefully whether we are using our existing infrastructure as efficiently as possible. This communication on the entry-exit system, which I will present in February, will be part of a borders package, which will also include the evaluation report on Frontex, as requested by the Hague Programme, and a communication on a European surveillance system (EUROSUR).</p>
      <p sl="en">On this basis, I look forward to a truly strategic discussion with Member States and Parliament on the future directions of the Union’s border policy, where new technologies will play a decisive role. In other words, it will be, in my view, an initial basis for a comprehensive strategic approach and discussion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Well, I also look forward to such a strategic discussion and I did not have any problems with the first part of your response, Commissioner. But what worries me is that, at that informal JHA Council in October, you were reported as calling for this entry-exit register which you said was extremely necessary, but you had not done a feasibility study. The 2005 communication said that it would be a huge organisational step and might therefore be risky and costly to implement. Are you not pre-empting it?</p>
      <p sl="en">The second part of your response was a sales pitch for entry-exit.

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Provisions in the new treaty on the supply of personal data of EU citizens to third countries</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Elmar Brok, MEP, a member of the European Parliament's delegation to the Intergovernmental Conference, has complained that members of the Council have agreed to include a provision in the new treaty permitting the personal data of EU citizens to be passed on to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This arrangement is being pushed through without citizens being notified in advance and without their involvement. Moreover, it fails to take into account the European Parliament's opposition to such a move, as set out in its resolution P6_TA(2007)0347 on the PNR agreement with the United States of America. Does the Commission agree to the inclusion of this provision in the new treaty? If not, how will it express its opposition?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-369" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The new Treaty, already agreed but not yet signed, does not include any general provision authorising the transmission of personal data of European citizens to third countries. In fact, Article 15a of the new Treaty guarantees the right, the general right, to the protection of personal data. Article 24 refers to the application of this general right and the processing of data in the common foreign and security policy area.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that the transfer of personal data to third countries is based on the general principles or relevant provisions of Directive 95/46/EC on personal data, particularly Articles 25 and 26. This Personal Data Directive remains in force. According to Article 25 of this particular directive, transfer of personal data is permitted only if the third country ensures an adequate level of protection. Article 26 of the same directive provides for the strict and explicit conditions under which it is possible to transfer personal data to third countries in other cases. The framework decision on data protection in the field of judicial and police cooperation will also be another very helpful instrument.</p>
      <p sl="en">We made a promise. The promise is to adopt, in agreement with Parliament, a framework decision on personal data protection by December. I am very confident that we will be able to get this very important political result. Why? Because the Portuguese Presidency seems very determined to reach this goal and there seems to be an overall consensus among Member States. You perhaps know that we discussed the framework decision on data protection at the last formal Justice and Home Affairs Council. On this, of course, I warmly wish close cooperation with Parliament, even closer than in the past, during the coming weeks. I think we have the common goal of getting it adopted before the end of December.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you are well aware, the overall intention is to guarantee the right to personal data protection. Article 24 is a derogation, in other words it establishes that a special rule pertains in a given area and for certain types of information and data. This certainly does not mean, in my opinion, that once the general principle is infringed none of the safeguards apply any longer, because obviously the general principle has not been set aside; a derogation from normal processing is justified by the fact that we are in the common foreign and security policy area. However, I repeat that in my view - and at this stage it is solely my personal interpretation, since the Treaty has not yet been signed or ratified - if there are one-off derogations to a general rule, those derogations cannot annul the right; they can regulate the ways of enjoying that right, which is obviously a different matter.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to remember that you invited the Commission here today to discuss the dispute between the United States and the European Union on the support provided by the governments concerned for Airbus and Boeing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Much ink has been spilled over these matters so let us start by recalling the key facts. What is at issue? The US Government claims that money that the European governments have invested in Airbus infringe WTO rules on subsidies. In October 2004 the United States, unilaterally and without prior notice, withdrew from a bilateral agreement signed with the European Union in 1992, which explicitly authorised this type of investment, and the US decided to being a case in the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union noted that the United States preferred litigation over negotiation and for its part asked the WTO to declare illegal the US subsidies granted to Boeing. Where are we now, three years later? Despite several attempts in the last few years to resolve the dispute amicably, the parties’ differences have prevented this from happening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The United States has denied giving subsidies to Boeing, and has said that prior to any negotiations the European Union would as a precondition have to stop giving Airbus the support previously provided under the system of repayable loans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You will appreciate that under these conditions it is impossible to establish a fair and balanced basis for a negotiated settlement. A few weeks ago Boeing publically rejected the latest olive branch, if I can call it that, proffered by Airbus. That was on 18 October.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore sceptical whether this dispute can be resolved at the negotiating table any time soon. This means that we will continue to defend in the WTO European support for Airbus, which has enabled the aviation sector to become more innovative and to improve the safety and efficiency of air travel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important to note that Airbus has paid back 40% more than it has received from the European governments since 1992 and has actually repaid in excess of EUR 7 billion. We hope, therefore, that the panel will demonstrate that the quite modest sums that Europe has granted in the form of aid for research and development and repayable loans have not had any impact on Boeing’s ability to compete.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think you can probably judge for yourselves: Boeing has just announced that its new B787 ‘Dreamliner’ has since its launch become the most commercially successful plane in history. The most successful plane it may be, but it is also perhaps the most heavily subsidised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ahead of a WTO hearing in September this year, we provided what I believe was solid evidence of the subsidies the United States gave to Boeing for that aircraft. We showed in particular that this financial aid totalled $24 billion from the federal authorities and certain states, including $16 billion from NASA and the Department of Defence in the form of support for research and development in the aviation sector that enabled Boeing to develop state-of-the-art aviation technologies and know-how at no cost. In addition, illegal, state subsidies designed for the exclusive benefit of Boeing were granted, notably in Washington State, where Boeing received subsidies totalling $4 billion, but also in Kansas, through ‘Boeing bonds’, and in Illinois. The third element is the illegal export subsidies that Boeing continues to receive under the legislation on FSC/ETI (Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion), in spite of the fact that the WTO has outlawed them on several occasions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once the WTO has come to a decision, probably in 2008, it is very likely that this will not be the end of the matter. Both parties will have the option of appealing, which may take us into 2009. We are of the opinion that after the WTO has taken a decision in the two cases, it would make sense to discuss with the United States how to manage the resulting implications, but we cannot be sure that that will result in proper negotiations of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, as far as the Commission is concerned, a negotiated solution would provide the necessary long-term solution the market requires to ensure peaceful and fair competition in the aviation sector in the future. Failing that, the Commission will continue to defend Europe’s interests resolutely and vigorously in the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After all, it is not only in the interest of Airbus to be able to compete fairly, but also suppliers, airlines and their customers, who should benefit from healthy competition between the major civil aircraft manufacturers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The competition between Airbus and Boeing should happen in the marketplace: we expect it to be tough but also fair and reasonable competition. However, this is not the case if the US competitor attempts to portray some of our Member States as, and I quote, ‘unreliable aerospace business partners and a security risk to US military readiness’, or to instigate legislation in the US Congress to block funds for improvements of US airports to accommodate the A380. This sort of campaigning is damaging to trans-Atlantic relations and inappropriate for a company that portrays itself as a global (and sometimes even European) player whenever it suits its needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the message we would like you to take home today is that on an official level both the EU and the US have made an effort – and have, I believe, managed – to ensure that this dispute does not damage the wider EU-US partnership.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We intend to keep it that way and we trust that the US Government will do the same by ensuring that the Airbus/Boeing disputes are not allowed to affect either company's ability to compete fairly in public procurement competitions. Notably, there should be no anti-competitive actions in legislation or executive policy that would restrict the ability of EU companies to compete in the current US aerial tanker recapitalisation programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would like to stress the important role the European Parliament and the national parliaments in the relevant countries can play in monitoring the situation. Your inter-parliamentary contacts will be very precious in bringing this message across the EU and possibly the Atlantic.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking also on behalf of Mrs Tokia Saïfi, who is a member of the Committee on International Trade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Boeing’s complaint against Airbus in the WTO is making it look like a bad loser. This is an industrial group that for decades dominated the market; now, since the start of this decade, since 2003 and 2004, Airbus has overtaken Boeing. Who would have imagined that 20 years ago? Then at precisely the same time Boeing’s complaint to the WTO appears. The complaint is nonsensical since the American manufacturer has always benefited from significant military research and development programmes from the Pentagon or NASA. Many of the technologies were first used in military aircraft and Boeing benefits from free transfer of technology from the military to the civil sector, just as it also benefits from various tax breaks from the US Government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What does Airbus, the European manufacturer, receive? Instead of subsidies, it gets repayable loans, which, as their name suggests, have to be repaid. Not only are they repayable but, as you said, Commissioner, the sums repaid are far in excess of the original loan since they depend on the number of planes sold, and practically all of Airbus’s aircraft have been successful. That will surely be the case in the future, too, with orders for the A380 and A350 piling up recently. In addition, this system operates openly and publicly, with complete transparency. Airbus does not benefit from any hidden aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, on my behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the European Parliament’s aeronautical intergroup, I must tell you that we will be monitoring this issue carefully, very carefully in fact. We expect you – and you have given us assurances in this respect, Commissioner – to defence vigorously the European manufacturer’s economic interests. The role of the European Union, like that of the United States, is not to try to go one better in the WTO, but to bring the partners together in bilateral negotiations to resolve their differences.</p>

      <p sl="en">As you know, the European Union is currently defending Airbus in a case before the WTO brought by the United States on behalf of Boeing. I believe it is important at this stage of the dispute for this body to build support for the European Union’s position and against that of the United States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should state at the outset that this entire dispute arose because Boeing no longer wished to participate in a mutually-agreed international agreement between the United States and the European Union – an agreement that allowed certain forms of government support to both Airbus and Boeing, the only two producers of large civil aircraft in the world. As my colleagues know, such agreements are the best foundation upon which relations among nations are based. It is incumbent on nations to abide by their obligations under these treaties. Airbus has. The European Union has. Unfortunately, the United States has not.</p>
      <p sl="en">Airbus and the European Union have constantly abided by the spirit and intent of the 1992 Bilateral Aircraft Agreement. For 11 years, competition between Airbus and Boeing flourished, resulting in important breakthroughs in commercial aviation technology and design that have led to safer, more efficient and more environmentally-sensitive air travel. But Boeing decided it no longer wanted to abide by the obligations of this agreement. Instead, with the assistance of the United States, they attacked Airbus for exacting so-called ‘illegal subsidies’ – the very government assistance that Boeing had originally agreed to in the 1992 agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">As many of my colleagues are aware, Airbus’s government loan funding is a targeted and non-trade-distorting use of a government’s limited research resources. It offers governments a fair return and brings to the market innovative products, which benefit everyone. Simply stated, European government research and development funding is limited, repayable and has no impact on Boeing’s ability to compete.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meanwhile, because Boeing produces both civil and military aircraft for the United States, technology used in its commercial aircraft today benefits greatly from US government awards to Boeing military research and development contracts. For example, Boeing’s current knowledge about composites, which is being used extensively in its new 787 Dreamliner, stems – by its own admission – from its work on developing the V-22, the F-22, the B-2 and the Joint Strike Fighter.</p>
      <p sl="en">This federal assistance is supplanted by US state and local government support to Boeing in the form of tax breaks, favourable real estate and local infrastructure improvements intended to secure the company’s presence and job base in selected US cities. While Boeing opposes the Airbus repayable assistance programme, it has no problem with identical programmes benefiting Boeing in Japan. I highlight these points not to imply that the assistance received by Boeing (repayable in Japan but not in the US) is somehow worse than the repayable European loans received by Airbus. I mention this assistance that Boeing receives to illustrate the reality that both sides benefit from some form of government assistance, from nations wishing to retain their global leadership roles in aviation. While Boeing has benefited from government support, it seeks to deny Europe similar benefits.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe we should urge the Commission to direct Airbus and Boeing to develop a forward-looking arrangement that provides a stable environment for both sides to compete and develop state-of-the-art aircraft well into the future. Maybe a six-month moratorium on the WTO case would allow the two companies time to complete a new discipline. This is the opportunity that is now before us. We can dwell on the past or look forward to the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, to many observers, the WTO dispute between Airbus and Boeing is starting to sound like a never-ending saga. I am happy that you have at least shown us a light at the end of the tunnel. In my view, in order to be able to evaluate the current situation and provide a policy recommendation on how we should go forward, it is worth reviewing the background to the dispute once again, together with the economic development of these two aviation giants.</p>
      <p sl="de">The origins of the current situation lie primarily in the massive increase in international aviation, accompanied by strong competition between aviation companies, since the early 1990s. May I, at this juncture, expressly pay tribute to the Commission once again for what it has achieved here. Without the establishment of the common market for the aviation industry in the 1990s and the Europeanisation of agreements with overseas countries, the competitiveness – and thus the success – of Europe's aircraft companies would have been impossible to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="de">The competition was tough, however, and some aircraft companies went to the wall. The demand for ever more economical, safer, larger, faster and more modern aircraft assumed dimensions in the 1990s which ultimately left only two well-performing companies in the running: Airbus and Boeing. Real alternatives to them now only exist in the regional and business aviation sector. I am proud that Airbus has managed to reinvent itself as a European company.</p>
      <p sl="de">For the European economies, aviation is an immensely important factor, without which economic life as a whole would quickly fall apart. Against this background alone, the developed economies have a massive interest in ensuring that well-performing air transport options are available to them. The aviation industry was compelled to recognise this, but was unable to keep pace. Above all, it lacked capital and it lacked the safeguards that would enable it to take on the enormous risks and massive expenditure associated with the development process.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the dualism between Airbus and Boeing intensified in the industry, competition between the two inevitably increased as well. During periods of weak demand on the world economy, the price war between Airbus and Boeing has been, and remains, intense. To ensure that this contest did not spill over into a competition to secure the largest share of State aid, a groundbreaking agreement was forged early on, in 1992.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2004, when times were hard for Boeing, the US broke that agreement and appealed to the WTO. The EU did not hesitate for long and sought the same remedy. Boeing also brought the case before the WTO. The WTO rules are very simple; we are familiar with them and they have been debated here in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, both sides now need to get back around the negotiating table. Both sides need to admit that their aircraft industry needs subsidies. That is especially true if we want to master the emerging problems of CO2 avoidance, protection against noise pollution and the increase in air traffic. We are moving into new technological territory here, and the risks for capital providers are immense. I would like to caution the EU's representatives against taking Airbus's current strength as a pretext for tightening the screws on Boeing and the US too zealously.</p>
      <p sl="de">Less than a year ago, we would have had to hold a very different debate. That is why both sides now need a viable strategy. Years of dispute and games of hide-and-seek will not take our technology sites forward. However, moving forward is essential. The key word – CO2 – has already been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask the Commission not to misunderstand what I am saying. It is not about letting the US pull the wool over our eyes about hidden military subsidies and ensuing cross-subsidisation. Let us encourage the Americans to play an honest game. I am confident that we can then reach a mutually acceptable solution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in the case before the World Trade Organisation regarding the complaint by Boeing against Airbus, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the bitter rivalry between the two economic and political power bases located on either side of the Atlantic has been ongoing for many years. I refer of course to the United States and to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should not come as a surprise to anyone that the debate is moving into ever more modern areas of the economy. The aeronautical sector is an example of just such an area. It is in that sector that new materials are developed and tested, along with new technologies for manufacturing them, new building solutions and also new automation, measurement and communication systems. New techniques for accelerated testing of the devices developed and reliability assessments are being devised too.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It stands to reason that the governments of individual countries and also the European Union should endeavour to support these areas of manufacture, in the hope that it might be possible to exploit the cutting edge solutions discovered across the economy as a whole. Since both parties to the dispute are therefore directly or indirectly providing financial support for their industries, there can only be one sensible outcome. The latter has to involve bilateral negotiations and establishing a gradual reduction of the subsidies provided to both parties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Cases dealt with through arbitration within the WTO framework can last for years and prove very costly. Indeed, in this instance the final settlement could threaten the very survival of both Boeing and Airbus.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The explanations provided by the Commission confirm that, as far as the United States is concerned, liberalism is above all a commodity for export. It is clear that in this area, as in many others, we are often ready to give ourselves enough rope to hang ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The US and Japanese Governments assist Boeing massively through military orders and public and public-private research. Thus, as already mentioned here, the Boeing 787 will be the most subsidised civil aircraft in history. The Commission must unfailingly defend Airbus in the WTO. That is its duty and the citizens will judge it on the results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Airbus benefits from the system of repayable loans: it is an appropriate, effective system. It ensures that Airbus does not fall prey to the dictates of the financial markets. It ensures that the states do not lose out on the money they invest in the aviation sector. This system must be complemented by a stronger aviation research sector, which would raise the European effort to the same level as the United States. This is crucial for our ability to compete both today and tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, there would be no aerospace industry without massive public intervention and support. The incompetence and weakness demonstrated by EADS’ two main private shareholders are proof of this. The Galileo problems illustrate this clearly, too. I firmly believe that the only way of guaranteeing the future of Airbus is to make EADS the first European majority public company. This future proposal was also put forward by numerous trade union activists at the hearing on Airbus organised by my group on 28 March.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We believe that the Airbus management must urgently withdraw the Power 8 plan, whose only purpose is to ensure that Airbus’s industrial model is identical to that of Boeing. However, that model is causing problems for Boeing, as illustrated by the very serious difficulties it is experiencing with the industrialisation of its 787 Dreamliner . Europe needs an aerospace industry that is powerful and that generates employment. To achieve this, it must ensure that the workers have strong powers to intervene in their company’s strategy.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the dispute between Boeing and Airbus brings to light a major difference in commercial policy and has grave economic implications. Let us, however, not overdramatise the situation. The dispute is in any case a far cry from the bilateral commercial battles of the past. What makes it problematic, ladies and gentlemen, is that it arose after the United States had unilaterally taken away the bilateral contractual framework. This, in turn, provoked a justifiable outcry from the EU about the subsidies of the United States, which was reneging on WTO rules. Regardless of the validity of the arguments on either side, it is true that the realignment of market shares in favour of Airbus and the consequent loss of Boeing’s competitive advantage were highly politicised. This caused a defensive knee-jerk reaction from the US administration, which turned to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="el">The EU has rightly sought an agreed solution to prevent the dispute from escalating beyond the limits of negotiation. However, there has been no response. I hope there will be, as the gravity of the dispute and its intense politicisation will undoubtedly put the jurisdictional robustness of the WTO system to the test. In that case, the settlement of the dispute could well be expected to further strengthen the credibility and international leadership qualities of the WTO, which does more than simply balance powers and weigh up interests.</p>
      <p sl="el">The outcome of the case is expected to have wider repercussions on the economies of the two partners, affecting terms of employment, trade balance and technological development. We have high hopes of a settlement to this dispute.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this debate and the Commission’s presence here to discuss the legal dispute between Europe and the United States, which has been running since 2004, when Washington took a case in the WTO against the European aid granted to Airbus.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with this attack, Europe, and the European Commission in particular, must show determination and conviction in order to defend a sector of undoubted economic importance. Indeed, the civil aviation sector in Europe, of which Airbus is the jewel in the crown, is the global showcase for European collaboration and European technological expertise. Now that the US Congress has pledged its full support for Boeing, it is the duty of the European Commission and Europe as a whole to make a political commitment to the Airbus cause.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Just a few weeks before the WTO’s dispute settlement body takes its decision, I believe that it is vital for the European Union to reiterate its support for Airbus. This issue is much more than a simple conflict between two aviation giants. It affects our capacity to defend a certain vision of the European commitment to our major projects and our industries. Our industrial policy must not be limited solely to the Union’s competition policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The US complaint in the WTO against the European mechanism of repayable loans for the aviation sector is, in my view, unfounded and surprising. It is unfounded because, by definition, the repayable loans are repaid. They are repaid to the extent that the European states have been able to get a return on their investment, and since 1992 Airbus has repaid 40% more than the sums loaned to it. The US criticism is also unfounded because the bilateral agreement signed between the European Union and the United States – broken unilaterally by the US in 2004, as the Commissioner said – authorised direct and indirect public aid to the civil aviation industry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This complaint is surprising because the United States is accusing Airbus of having been subsidised even though Boeing benefits from a quasi-monopoly of extensive equipment programmes of the US army and NASA and public support for military development programmes. Therefore, unlike the indirect US aid that is not repaid and is incompatible with the provisions of the SMC Agreement and 1994 GATT, the system of repayable loans could not be considered to be an infringement of WTO rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I thus hope that the European Commission defends resolutely this legitimate position. In this respect, and having regard to the extreme importance of this matter for the future of the European aviation sector, what specific arguments does the Commission intend to put forward to defend Airbus in the WTO?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to point out that both the United States and the European Union risk seeing all or part of their public aviation support mechanisms condemned by the WTO. To avoid this, the parties had raised the possibility of an amicable solution. Can the European Commission tell us whether it plans to go down that path as mentioned? It is crucial to explore all possible solutions because the future of thousands of people, companies and regions throughout Europe depends on this sector and a positive outcome to this conflict.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Airbus is a European success story and a model of European cooperation. Airbus provides jobs at six European locations and employs a total of 58 000 workers. In Hamburg, where I come from, there are 12 000 people working for Airbus. In the past, Airbus has shown that EU industry, given the right strategy, can compete successfully in the toughest markets with top technology. In the dispute between the US company Boeing and the European Airbus, each side is accusing the other of paying billions in subsidies and brought complaints before the WTO in 2004.</p>
      <p sl="de">This could have negative consequences for transatlantic trade relations, which I would warn against, but it is very important, nonetheless, that the EU makes it clear that the financial support provided for Airbus was in conformity with WTO rules. Both sides have declared their willingness to find a solution outside the WTO and reach an agreement on a bilateral basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our goal, as politicians, should be to avoid a dispute over subsidies in the aircraft industry. The economic performance of the two companies must not be jeopardised, and financial support should focus primarily on research. This must include an increasingly strong emphasis on environmental, social and indeed employment policy aspects. It is important, for the competitiveness of European industry, to ensure that Airbus also remains competitive. In the European Parliament, we must stand up for fair competition. The Commission must act on this, for we all have an interest in ensuring that by 2010, the EU is the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. Economic and employment policy, combined with innovative technology policy, will play an extremely important role in achieving that goal.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, first of all I think I can speak on behalf of Commissioner Mandelson when I say that we are grateful for your unanimous support for the vigorous and just defence of the European interests in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two people asked whether we should try to relaunch amicable negotiations. I naturally cannot speak for Commissioner Mandelson, but I can say that it takes two to have amicable negotiations in this case. The European Commission is certainly prepared to negotiate amicably, as long as the negotiations are transparent and we are on an equal footing, because the case introduced and put forward by Commissioner Mandelson is extremely convincing in my opinion. Several speakers have said the same. I think I can say that we are in a strong position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the call for vigilance, the way in which the Commission has spoken and the way in which my colleague Commissioner Mandelson is dealing with the matter clearly indicate that we are extremely vigilant about this issue, for the legitimate reasons that have been expressed with great conviction during this debate. You can therefore count on the Commission. I will obviously pass on to Commissioner Mandelson your strong support and your requests for great vigilance and commitment to a topic that directly affects Europe’s economic interests.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Boeing and Airbus have been accusing one another of receiving illegal government subsidies for years. This game of reciprocal complaints being examined by the WTO’s dispute settlement body continues to fuel the row between the two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world. If confirmed and acknowledged, these accusations of direct subsidies represent serious obstacles to the global economic system and distort the free market with serious damage to the competitive regime laid down by the WTO. At a time when we are defending a global system free of any obstacles, this trade war is a glitch in global competition, which is supposed to be fair and just. Only the WTO’s competent body will be able to offer impartial conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nonetheless, we know that Boeing wants to position itself as the world leader and this complaint must not turn into an attempt to destabilise Airbus. This trade dispute is delicate but should not damage trans-Atlantic cooperation at a time when the Doha Round is at a standstill and a favourable outcome is hoped for by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0392/2007) by Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2006 (2007/2132(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-395" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Stavros Dimas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the work of the Committee on Petitions is an admirable resource enabling us to gain an in-depth understanding of the problems and complaints of citizens regarding European affairs.</p>
      <p sl="el">While these cover a wide range of policy areas, they frequently touch up on land-planning and environmental issues. They essentially involve all Member States and encompass broad sections of civil society, from individual citizens to multinational NGOs.</p>
      <p sl="el">Your rapporteur rightly, I think, underlines the importance of the work entailed in the 1 000 or more petitions you receive each year. There are three aspects of the report and the resolution that I should like to mention.</p>
      <p sl="el">The first of these is a recent development: the visits the Commission makes to places where a particular problem has arisen. These visits may have considerable media impact and will undoubtedly give your work a higher profile. In addition to being covered by the press and the media generally, these missions engender very detailed reports which, in my opinion, are of high quality. I believe these are important records of your activity and certainly deserve wide publicity. Those of you who managed to hear the radio programmes last week about the activity of the Committee on Petitions will have understood how important it is that you should give those submitting petitions a personal hearing in the presence of all the necessary experts. This represents a large investment in time and resources, but I am sure it would be worthwhile.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second point I should like to emphasise has always been a favourite in these debates: the coexistence or even duplication of a petition and complaint, possibly giving rise to a contravention procedure. The report indicates that in 2006 at least, the Commission once again did not keep Parliament as well informed as the latter would have liked. You must surely have foreseen that at this point I would answer by referring to our recent communication on the enforcement of Community law, entitled ‘A Europe of Results’. This communication contains commitments on transparency, the setting of priorities, modernisation, better cooperation with the national authorities and everything you could wish for in these cases of duplication. That is not all, however. We have already started work on a document outlining the policy. The document will put all this to use in the environment sector, which, as I understand from your report, is one of the sectors you are most concerned with.</p>
      <p sl="el">The third and final point I should like to mention applies more to the future. Let me assure you once again that we intend there to be the best possible cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. Such cooperation is mutually beneficial. Systematic cooperation leads to a better exchange of information and hence an improvement in the level of service offered to our citizens in all sectors. This is what we all want, so let us try to ensure that the examination of petitions is exemplary.</p>
      <p sl="el">Once again, I congratulate the rapporteur for raising this issue.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I firstly wish to thank Commissioner Dimas for his comments and reflections, and I would of course also like to thank all those who made this report possible, including the secretariat staff, all my colleagues who took part in the committee’s debates and those who have enhanced this report by tabling amendments to improve it. I thank you all.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I am tabling this report pursuant to Rule 192 of the Rules of Procedure on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2006. The current report provides an overview of the main elements that characterised the activity of the Committee on Petitions last year. It points out its achievements, and also indicates certain areas where further progress is needed, since obviously we must continue to improve.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of all Parliament’s committees, it is the Committee on Petitions that is in closest proximity to the citizens. Citizens can approach it on either an individual or group basis, and the committee attempts to provide them with the best solutions, ensuring that the petitions are managed in a transparent and effective way and that the citizens obtain comprehensive answers to the issues they raise.</p>
      <p sl="es">The right of petition, enshrined in the EC Treaty in Articles 21 and 194, is a significant feature of European citizenship as it enables any European Union citizen and any natural or legal person residing or having a registered office in a Member State to address the European Parliament on matters falling within the EU’s remit.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore wish to point out with some enthusiasm that the statistics once more show a steady flow of petitions. For example, 1 032 petitions were submitted in 2005 and 1 016 in 2006. Approximately one third were declared inadmissible. It should be pointed out that the main areas of concern for petitioners generally continue to be the environment and the free movement of goods, persons and capital.</p>
      <p sl="es">The petitions reflect an important image of the application of European legislation and the impact it has on individuals. Through their petitions, European citizens highlight the shortcomings and difficulties of the transposition and application process: they are in an ideal position to monitor the implementation of EU legislation at national level.</p>
      <p sl="es">The proportion of inadmissible petitions also indicates a continuous need to raise public awareness and inform European citizens more successfully about EU legislation and policies, and about their legitimate right to petition the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to achieve this, a concerted effort is required by this European institution, but it must be accompanied by the efforts on the part of the various national institutions in each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also wish to state, in relation to the European Commission, that the Committee on Petitions relies on the Commission’s expertise in investigating the possible infringements of Community legislation that are brought to light in the petitions.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission’s recommendations remain instrumental in defining the most appropriate answer to petitioners’ problems. Nevertheless, the committee encouraged and continues to encourage the European Commission to avoid standard, occasionally rather general answers based on a strict interpretation of its competences and the information provided by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Petitions continued to emphasise the importance of ensuring that the assessments of the petitions should put greater emphasis on citizens’ real problems, and to ask the European Commission to carry out independent investigations that could provide for a more coherent approach to specific issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also want to point out that in its dialogue with the European Commission the committee has constantly underlined the important role petitions play in achieving the common goal of bringing Europe closer to the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">It should also be said that the committee and the European Ombudsman had a constructive relationship based on constant dialogue and mutual respect for each other’s competences and prerogatives, and two reports were presented.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, I would like to complain once again about the fact that this report in particular is being dealt with at such an inconvenient hour in terms of its public resonance. I have five comments to make in all.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that we need decisions about Treaty infringement proceedings from the Commission. It is not enough, Commissioner, to produce a document that is simply designed to record one's own determination, which is what the interpretation has just said; rather, it is essential to bring about real improvements. Your job is to facilitate decisions about Treaty infringement proceedings which you then publish, if necessary with the ensuing judicial decisions or legal rulings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, the Council is becoming more political. With more qualified majority voting, the Council is taking on more overall responsibility, as co-legislator, for its legislation and thus for the execution of these laws. We wish to emphasise once again that we would therefore very much welcome much more involvement by the Council in the activities of the Committee on Petitions and, for example, the designation of a senior official to coordinate petition-related matters.</p>
      <p sl="de">My fifth and final point is this: we do not just want to criticise others. With this report, we want to send out the message that we ourselves, as the European Parliament, need to improve. You can read about this in paragraphs 25 and 26. We need a better process in the European Parliament. We need appropriate human resources, we need appropriate response times, we need better workflows, we need a more transparent procedure for citizens, and we need a better method of sifting out unimportant and inadmissible petitions at an early stage so that we can focus on those that are admissible and important. Parliament has taken a significant step forward here by setting up a committee of inquiry, so we are well on track.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I do not support Amendment 1 to paragraph 15, and I am surprised that Mr Atkins has put his name to it. I believe that it undermines the Committee on Petitions and the work of the Ombudsman, and I would urge Members to oppose it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The committee plays an important role in bringing the Union closer to the citizen. Indeed, we have succeeded on many occasions in gaining recompense and fair play, both for individual complainants and for entire communities. The European Parliament is increasingly seen by citizens as an important platform from which to defend their environment, the quality of their drinking water and their archaeological heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are weaknesses, however, which have to be addressed in the mechanisms available to the committee and to the Commission in terms of seeking redress and to enforce decisions on governments and local authorities for negligence and, in some cases, deliberate avoidance of the implementation of European law.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are examples: the M30 motorway project in Madrid, which I, myself, visited on behalf of the committee, where the authorities are still not implementing the agreed actions to remedy their breaches of EU law; a similar case regarding lettori in Italy, who have been frustrated in their search for fair play for over 20 years; and the inadequate laws and procedures to protect drinking water and archaeological heritage in Ireland. I believe that, as a Petitions Committee and as a Union, we owe petitioners at least the implementation of decisions that have been made against governments and local authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Wallström today pointed out in this Parliament that the law is only as good as its implementation. Clearly, there are lots of laws at European level not being properly implemented at national level, and citizens will not have confidence in the European Union until they are.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report. I myself became a member of the Committee on Petitions just over one year ago and during that time I have had first-hand experience of the very valuable work that is done by the committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">But how often do we as politicians hear of the democratic deficit, and how often are we therefore urged to engage with citizens? Well, the Committee on Petitions is a tangible, hands-on, practical way of engaging with European citizens. There is an essential element of truth in the statement that all politics is local, and while individuals throughout the EU-27 are concerned with the big issues of globalisation, EU enlargement, emigration, energy supply etc., they are most often concerned with how these issues affect their lives, their families and their communities. Equally, with European legislation, citizens are concerned with how this impacts on their lives and their communities. And where they perceive misapplication or unfair application of European legislation, they want a relatively simple, easy and effective way of dealing with that situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is what they look for in the Committee on Petitions. If their petition is declared admissible, they want it dealt with in an efficient and timely way, and in this I particularly support the rapporteur on paragraphs 9, 10 and 12, where he calls on both the Commission and the committee to improve their timeliness.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also agree with the rapporteur on paragraphs 25 and 26, where he calls for the need to strengthen the committee secretariat and the need to find the necessary financial resources to continue the development of the e-petition software system.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, the Petitions Committee is very much part of the public face of the European institutions: citizens can access the committee and have their case heard, and it is a crucial part of EU citizenship. But the system must work efficiently. If it does not, it is the worst of all possible outcomes, because not only do citizens consider that the misapplication or non-application of EU legislation negatively impacts on their lives, but the very system that is there to support them in fact lets them down. That is why a well-functioning, properly resourced Committee on Petitions, working in good cooperation with the Commission and the Council, is core to supporting and validating the rights of EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I fully support the suggestion to enhance the visibility of the Citizens’ Portal in relation to the right to petition. If citizens know that they have the right to petition and they have the expectation of a fair and timely response, then we are strengthening EU legislation, we are giving it greater legitimacy and transparency and we are strengthening the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say to the Commissioner that we must improve the functioning of the committee, as outlined in this report, and that wonderful phrase ‘connecting with citizens’ can become a reality rather than just an aspiration.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I should like to thank sincerely the rapporteur, Mr Iturgaiz, the members of the Committee on Petitions and also its secretariat, headed by Mr Lowe, for the trend-setting work they have undertaken during the past three years of this parliamentary term.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Committee on Petitions has dealt with all manner of issues that were distressing the citizens of the European Union and were important to them. These issues included the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty with the reference to God and to Christianity, the bankruptcy of individuals involved with Lloyds and Equitable Life, and the Catholic broadcaster Radio Cope in Barcelona. The Committee on Petitions also dealt with land use plans for Valencia, excise duty on motor vehicles, the Rospuda Valley by-pass in Poland, infringement of European Union Directives affecting Ireland (Tara), and the Orléans by-pass in France. In addition, the committee considered the activities of the so-called Jugendamt, the German authorities dealing with young people; many complaints were lodged against the Jugendamt.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As Mr Iturgaiz stated, the Committee on Petitions is very important to the people of Europe. It brings the EU institutions closer to the citizens and is crucial in terms of making societies aware of the real nature of these institutions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Mr Iturgaiz, I would like to thank you for this excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="es">I wish to start by asking the President to pass on the serious concern of all members of the Committee on Petitions about the committee secretariat’s total lack of human resources. I would also like her to pass on this concern to the EP’s Bureau, which is responsible for providing sufficient resources for this extremely important task of maintaining fluid communication with the EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I wish to take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Dimas here. Since many of the petitions relate to the environment and many of them are from Spain, I would like to discuss how they could be better handled.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, as guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission is obviously not fulfilling its role when it fails to act with sufficient speed in relation to many petitions. On numerous occasions we are faced with situations where we act in articulo mortis : in other words, by the time we get around to considering infringement proceedings, it is too late.</p>
      <p sl="es">Then, as some of my colleagues said, we must take a look at the information supplied by the petitioners. There are far too many cases, notably in Spain, where there has been no clear response to the petition and not even an attempt to take a serious look at the information provided, for example the petitions on opencast mines or ski resorts in the middle of Natura 2000 areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the other hand, the European Commission has taken exemplary action on other petitions, and here we could cite the case of the Rospuda valley in Poland. Nevertheless, we are concerned, as I have already mentioned, that in many cases the Commission arrives on the scene too late after a flagrant breach of environmental laws. We have, for example, the case of the 501 highway in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, where infringement proceedings were initiated when the work had already finished.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are also concerned about the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive. These are not being applied properly in many countries, especially Spain, where the projects are chopped up so that the Directive does not have to be applied.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, application of the Water Framework Directive remains extremely patchy, and in some cases relating to large properties in Spain where mandatory reports have been issued against the Spanish Government itself, the European Commission refuses to take precautionary action.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, it is true that one of the Directives most frequently infringed is the Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment, which is compulsory for all building and planning.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our problem is simply that we arrive on the scene too long after the petitions have been submitted by citizens, when the irreversible damage has already been done.</p>
      <p sl="es">In Spain we have seen some extremely negative effects along our entire coastline as a result of very aggressive building projects. Currently a regasification plant is being built right in the middle of El Ferrol estuary, which is of great Community interest and part of the Natura 2000 network, and no environmental impact assessment has been carried out. This is the only regasification plant in Spain that will not have an environmental impact assessment, thereby creating a lack of security and infringing clear Directives.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will each of us have to strive to speed up our responses so that the citizens see that their rights are not being violated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I consider the Committee on Petitions one of the most valuable committees in Parliament, if not the most valuable. It is the form in which the citizens tell us how the many laws we tinker with in other committees affect them or do not affect them. Without this feedback we are doomed to work in a vacuum. But, in terms of doing our work properly, there is something missing in the procedure: the Council and the Permanent Representation of the Member States. How can we get results for a citizen in dispute with their country without that country being represented in the Petitions Committee?</p>
      <p sl="de">The second thing I want to mention is a particular petition. The people of Ireland came to the Petitions Committee, with three petitions in all, in connection with our most important sensitive archaeological site: Tara, the home of the High Kings and of St Patrick. The Petitions Committee has responded and has asked for the destruction to stop. The Commission has brought a case against the Irish authorities and yet, by the time anything happens, there will be a motorway, probably there for already three or four years, and all the destruction will have happened. The Irish people will not get over their disillusionment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, on his excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having been a member of the Committee on Petitions myself since the beginning of this year, I too have to admit that I am becoming a keen supporter of this committee and the importance of its role. I dare say, however, that many Members in this House are not giving this committee the importance that it deserves, and this should change.</p>
      <p sl="en">If EU citizenship means anything, surely it must mean that citizens of Europe can stand up for their rights and make their voices heard, regardless of whether they stand up against companies, local or regional authorities, public agencies or even their own national governments. This right can best be exercised through the use of the petition to the European Parliament – a right that is recognised as a basic right in the Treaty. Provided that their complaint concerns rights under EU law, people can rely on Europe and on us, as representatives of Europeans, to support them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The petition is a great tribute, I would say, to Europe and what it stands for, but it is also a great credit to Member States, because Member States themselves signed a Treaty which gave the right to petition, even if the petition can often be used as a tool against Member State authorities themselves. So I strongly urge EU citizens to stand up for their rights, to use the petition as a tool to defend themselves on EU rights. Those who will do so will surely find us standing right there behind them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Parliament received 1 016 petitions in 2006. As in 2005, approximately one third of these petitions were not within the sphere of competence of the European Union and were therefore deemed inadmissible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is indicative of the need to ensure that the citizens are properly informed about the remit of the Union and its institutions. In this connection, I should like to emphasise the enormous contribution made by the Committee on Petitions to the work of the European Parliament in terms of communicating with the citizens and promoting transparency and responsibility in the Union's decision-making process. The close cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman is also to be commended.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nonetheless, greater commitment from the Council is urgently needed. In particular, a senior official should be appointed to coordinate petitions, as many of the latter involve sensitive political issues relating to the transposition of Community provisions into the national legislation of the Member States. The only way to meet the citizens' expectations in terms of swift and effective responses to their complaints is by speeding up the process of examining petitions and ensuring cooperation between the various institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur for a very well prepared document.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report. At the same time I wish to congratulate the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, its members and secretariat for the splendid work they are carrying out.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Committee on Petitions, despite the fact that on occasion its attendance by MEPs is rather slim, is, I believe, one of the most important committees which links the ordinary citizen of Europe with the EU institutional order. It provides the mechanism through which our constituents can feel closer to the EU, and it greatly facilitates a feeling among citizens that the EU institutions are not faceless and blameless bureaucrats, but that they also can be held to account, and responsibilities can be asked for and criticisms directed at those that do not do their job as well as they should.</p>
      <p sl="en">Importantly, this report shows that the continued dialogue of the Committee on Petitions with the Ombudsman and the Commission has been a most useful exercise, but, sadly, the cooperation with the Member States and the Council leaves a lot to be desired, and this is an area where significant improvement is needed urgently.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the contribution made by the Committee on Petitions to communication between the European Parliament and the citizens of the Member States is invaluable and responds to society's expectations. It is a fact that every year approximately 1 000 petitions are received, some 2 500 documents, and that as many documents again are sent out annually. Clearly, therefore, such direct contact with the European Parliament is necessary for the citizens of our countries and encourages them to hope that their problems can be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of course, this does not mean that the authors of these petitions are always right. They encompass differences of opinions and interests. Nonetheless, the very fact that the Committee on Petitions examines the petitions makes it possible to appreciate the problems that are of concern to society. It also provides an opportunity to improve legislation that is not always unambiguous or transparent, to eliminate legal loopholes and to prevent infringement or incorrect transposition of Community legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to thank the Committee on Petitions for the outcome of its useful work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am here and am delighted to be so, because I think that the work that the Committee on Petitions does – and I want to congratulate the rapporteur on the work in terms of his report – is very different to any other committee and, indeed, any other report you will find. We are, I suppose, as members of the committee, and to use that well-worn phrase which I do not like, ‘close to the citizen’. I think that is very important. They ring our office, they know our assistants, they ask for help, and we do that. We give them help and bring their petitions to Parliament. We also deal with a wide range of issues, and that requires Members to educate themselves on all of those issues that come before us, from environment matters to financial services to whatever it is.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are the committee that most frequently meets, greets and deals with ‘real people’ – and, again, that is a phrase I do not like to use, but it is a very important one when we speak here in this Chamber so late in the evening. But the truth is that we rely greatly on the Commission to come back to us with answers, and sometimes the quality, and indeed quantity, of the responses at meetings is poor, I have to say; not always, but in some cases it is not timely and we could do our business a little bit better. I would support all of the efforts and the mentions made in the report that we do just that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe, though, that it takes a particular individual to come to the Committee on Petitions of Parliament. There are many citizens who would like to do it, but would not be able to, so we are dealing with people with great determination and obviously people who are angry as well about what is happening in their Member State and they want action.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will give you an example of a landfill dump called Whiteriver in my own country, in Co. Louth. It is on our agenda at some time in the future, but even the threat of the Committee on Petitions dealing with this issue has resulted in positive action on the ground. So, sometimes, we have an effect and we may not even know about it before the petition comes to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to mention particularly last year’s Equitable Life, which was a child, if you like, of the committee’s work. Again, in relation to Equitable Life, it was very important for us not to promise more to people than we could actually deliver. What the people wanted from us was obviously some measure of redress in terms of compensation for their losses. We could not do that and we were very strict in saying that, but I think it was important that we pointed out where the responsibility lay – and it lay with the UK Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is also important that we keep the pressure on those with the responsibility, again the UK authorities, in relation to Equitable Life, to get them to take action. A lot of our work is political and it is about pressure points and we have to be determined in order to get results.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say this and I have said it to my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group: I think we need a quality-control measure on the work of the committee so that we can do our work better, that we ask petitioners after we have gone through the process what they thought of us in terms of the work we did. I think we should not be afraid of that. Lastly can I say, because I say it every time I get a chance, European City Guides needs to be addressed, and I hope it will be.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers in this very interesting debate for their positive contributions. I agree with most of the speakers, especially Ms McGuinness, Mr Tomaszewska and Mr Matsakis, who said that this committee is one of the most important committees and that it connects European citizens with the European Union’s institutions. I fully agree and I am willing to cooperate as much as possible in order to respond to the concerns of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to answer two main questions: how to conciliate the precautionary principle with the need to have evidence before attacking a Member State. I am aware of the issues raised by Mr Hammerstein and I would like to say that legal enforcement action can only challenge decisions formally taken by Member States in breach of European Union law. The Commission cannot initiate legal proceedings on a judgment of intent. Therefore, until a decision is formally taken, there is no room for legal action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the issue of the speed of action, the Commission needs to respect the procedural requirements of the Treaty and to make sure that it has developed the right arguments and compiled the necessary evidence where court action is needed. This can take time. Nevertheless, in December 2006, the Commission – myself, actually – for the first time obtained an interim order from the European Court of Justice in the environment domain, suspending illegal hunting rules in Italy before the main legal action was heard. On 18 April 2007, we obtained our first interim order in relation to an infrastructural project.</p>
      <p sl="en">Each case needs to be evaluated on its own merits, even if recent initiatives from the Commission, supported by the European Parliament, such as those relating to illegal hunting in Italy, which I have previously referred to, or to the Rospuda Valley, illustrate the interest of using this procedure in order to protect the environment. It should not be used as a routine mechanism. This mechanism should only be used for high-profile cases where the adoption of interim measures can have a pedagogical effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for his very informative report, which I sincerely hope will contribute to raising the visibility of the work of the Committee on Petitions, and I assure you, once again, of the Commission’s firm commitment to collaboration with you all.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I requested this report after I made the following discovery: although earthquakes in the 20th century have killed 1.5 million people worldwide and injured many more; although earthquakes are the second most deadly natural disaster in the world; and although in 2002-2007, earthquakes were the fourth most frequent natural disaster in the Member States and the candidate countries, we in the EU responded to the problem only occasionally and peripherally, and only in the context of other natural disasters.</p>
      <p sl="el">I now feel vindicated and satisfied that my report has been approved by the Committee on Regional Development and enjoys the support of all the political groups. The European Parliament’s message is clear: in future we, the EU, must not and cannot deal with the problem of earthquakes intermittently and peripherally; we must focus on it as a distinct, separate problem and examine all of its individual aspects and components.</p>
      <p sl="el">In particular, the report asks the Commission to waste no time in preparing a communication containing an earthquake risk assessment and an examination of prevention, management, relief and restoration measures. In other words, the communication has to be equivalent to that on floods. The European Parliament expects the Commission to examine, at least within the scope of such a communication, a number of proposals contained in the report.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, the adoption of earthquake protection measures should in future be an essential requirement for the funding of infrastructure from the Structural Funds, especially in view of the fact that earthquakes threaten the overall economic and social cohesion of the regions affected. Earthquakes are, above all, a threat to life and limb, infrastructure, employment, the environment, cultural heritage and tourism.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, we should promote the construction of new buildings, as well as the conservation and upgrading of old buildings and structures, which include monuments that are not compliant with earthquake specifications.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, the European Commission should ensure that more funds are allocated to public information and the training of professionals dealing with earthquakes.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fourthly, a European strategy for earthquake research should be developed. Account should be taken of not only the social but also the economic benefits that such action entails.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fifthly, a technical protocol should be drawn up on joint action by the EU in the event of serious seismic disasters, with particular emphasis on the crucial infrastructures of transport, energy, telecommunications and health.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, the Barnier proposal should be revived. There should also be a follow-up to the Sarkozy-Karamanlis proposal for a European civil protection force, through a legislative – I stress the word, legislative – proposal by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, the report to be approved tomorrow by this Parliament makes specific proposals. We – both the Commission and the Member States – wish to respond to them immediately and take action in accordance with each party’s responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation, and also my fellow Members in all political groups who have improved my original proposal through their interventions and amendments.</p>

    <intervention id="2-415" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Stavros Dimas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, and I personally, wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, for this extremely informative and valuable report.</p>
      <p sl="el">Earthquakes are not easy to deal with. There needs to be adequate preparation and sufficient measures must be taken in advance so that we can cope with the most serious effects.</p>
      <p sl="el">2007 was an important year for developing ways of dealing with natural disasters at EU level. Not only did we have the largest single mobilisation of the EU civil protection mechanism to fight the Greek forest fires, but two new legislative measures on civil protection were adopted: the financial instrument for civil protection, and a revised European civil protection mechanism. In addition, as announced in September and following the European Parliament’s resolution on forest fires and floods, the Commission is to launch a special initiative to strengthen the EU’s capacity to deal with disasters.</p>
      <p sl="el">A rapid and effective response to emergencies is obviously of crucial importance, particularly for risks such as earthquakes, which are practically impossible to foresee. However, even when unforeseen events occur, an effective response can and must be supplemented by suitable preventive measures, such as early warning, to limit potential damage and enable the situation to be brought under control.</p>
      <p sl="el">For these reasons, in 2008 the Commission will develop a complete initiative to improve disaster prevention generally.</p>
      <p sl="el">After response and prevention, the third stage in the management of disasters such as earthquakes is restoration. In this context, I welcome Parliament’s call for the Council to promote the proposal on the Solidarity Fund.</p>
      <p sl="el">The financial instrument for civil protection provides a long-term funding framework for civil protection such as earthquake response operations. The new regulation has almost doubled the funds available. The Commission also has special plans for dealing with earthquake-related issues and, thanks to the capital allocated by the European Parliament to the EU budget in 2006, the Commission is already supporting the STEP project. This project is being implemented through a partnership between Italy, Portugal and Germany and aims to develop a mobile assessment and administration unit for earthquake management. The Commission endorses the appeal by the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, for better coordination. The events of last summer have shown that although the EU civil protection response was impressive, there is still room for improvement. On the basis of the recommendations of the Barnier report, the Commission is now developing ready-formed civil protection units composed of disaster response experts that can be mobilised instantly.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, the rapporteur, Mr Vakalis, underlines the importance of cooperation with third countries. The civil protection mechanism allows cooperation with third countries and with the Euromed programme in the prevention, mitigation and management of natural and man-made disasters and is another good example of cooperation in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Vakalis on his report. As a Greek, he has tackled a subject that also affects his own region and citizens. He completed his own-initiative report in a very short time and I give it my full support.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would very much like to look at disaster control and disaster prevention in a broader context, namely climate change. Rainfall, serious rainfall, floods, rising sea levels, etc. are going to become more and more prevalent.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In that respect, people naturally look to the European Union. From 31 October to 2 November I participated in a debate in the United Nations in New York with representatives of many continents and regions. They also look to Europe and ask us to do our best as regards prevention, prevention programmes and disaster prevention, and want us to bring our expertise into play.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that we do indeed need to offer this, alongside innovation and solidarity, on a global scale. My country, the Netherlands, also partially lies below sea level and has special expertise that we can use in this area. I am therefore pleased that we can set a good example with the various funds in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to reiterate my support for what was said in the debate with the Commission this morning: our Solidarity Fund must be more flexible. We have a very good Fund, a very good example, but the European Council still has reservations about it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, Madam President, Mr Vakalis’ report has a specifically European dimension. Disasters are frequently multinational, they do not stop at borders, and I would thus call on the Commission to put forward initiatives with a view to protecting and supporting our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Mr. Rapporteur, dear colleagues, the report on the regional impact of earthquakes was not an easy undertaking, especially because it came as earthquakes do: very quickly and unexpectedly. For this reason, I would like to congratulate our colleague Mr. Vakalis for the way in which he managed to be a captain on this ship.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Since earthquakes have no ideological connotations, we have had no clashes of opinions among groups. Our only mission was to find pragmatic formulas to fill a gap in legislation and to create efficient response mechanisms at a European level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to say that, according to Mr. Vakalis’ initial intuition, during the research period for this report we discovered that, at the level of the European Union, we have serious gaps regarding earthquake protection.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have no unitary mechanism for intervention in case of an earthquake. Hazard maps are lacking in many European countries and regions. We have no relevant national laws in many countries. We invest very little in research. We have no European research agenda in the field of seismic risk.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Seismic risk protection in insurance policies, for instance, is lacking or is insignificant. We have no education campaign for the population, although we have a Eurocod 8, which contains instructions for earthquake protection. Nevertheless, it does not apply to urban planning regulations for new constructions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In a word, we also proposed other things. Mr. Vakalis has mentioned some of them. Those of us who come from the Party of European Socialists reiterated the support for establishing a European civil protection force, inviting the Commission to make a proposal for this purpose. We proposed a European centralized instrument for preventing and managing earthquake crises. We insisted on advanced research and a programme financed at the European level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To all this, Mr. Vakalis operated like a perfect catalyst, he prepared excellent syntheses for compromise amendments when we threatened to draw up a report the size of a dictionary. For this reason, I believe the report is a result of excellent team work and I congratulate Mr. Vakalis and all the colleagues who participated in this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, congratulations to Mr Vakalis for his excellent work. This report highlights the fact that, although earthquakes can have a devastating economic and social impact in seismic-stricken regions, not enough attention has been paid to them by the EU. The rapporteur advocates – and rightly so – that a series of regulatory and financial measures are urgently needed in order to remedy this unhappy state of affairs. Such measures should aim at minimalisation of damage caused as well as facilitating speedy and effective response and compensation to affected individuals and communities.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Vakalis states that an area which should be given special attention is that of research. I agree. Not necessarily of course research in predicting earthquakes, a practice which has been proven to have limitations, but research in the way we construct our buildings. Attention to more stable, robust and lightweight materials is an example. Safety features to prevent electrocution and electric fires being caused after a tremor are another area where research can help prevent loss of life. Research into telecommunications systems that do not get so easily jumped in the panic that follows an earthquake and research into specialised equipment for detecting and extracting victims from collapsed buildings are other areas where research can be most helpful and very rewarding.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the motion for a resolution on the regional impact of earthquakes addresses for the first time, in a logical and coherent fashion, the issue of seismic vulnerability in parts of the Union and consequently the remit of civil protection services. I therefore say to the rapporteur: praise where praise is due!</p>
      <p sl="it">I am fascinated by, and directly involved in, this matter, living as I do in the European region at greatest risk of seismic and volcanic activity: Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna. I had the honour of serving as the Italian Government's commissioner for emergencies recently during a serious eruption of that volcano. I am therefore familiar with the problem at close quarters, and I also know how behind the times Italy is when it comes to risk forecasting and prevention, and not just seismic risk of course.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe, too, lags a long way behind on this front, however. I have, for example, been calling on Parliament and the Commission for years to establish a European Civil Protection Agency responsible for coordinating the Member States' emergency management services and drawing up a uniform policy on prevention, forecasting and training for staff and volunteers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today's resolution appears to go in that direction at long last. If the truth be told, the European Union as a whole still lacks a culture of civil protection, which often remains nothing more than the subject of round tables and electoral promises, even though what is at stake is the right of each and every one of us to safety. Before asking local actors, provinces, municipalities and regions for concrete examples, Europe should demonstrate that it wishes to turn the page at last, and I believe that this resolution could constitute the first proper step in that direction.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, earthquakes are inevitable, but protective shielding measures can be taken to minimise death and destruction and to allow people to enjoy greater safety.</p>
      <p sl="el">The rapporteur proposes a number of valid measures, which I shall not reiterate. However, I must in addition emphasise the need for pre-earthquake inspection and the reinforcement of structures where there is a problem, in both public and private buildings such as factories, colleges, recreation centres: I mean places where people gather in large numbers. At the same time, we must protect and extend open spaces to accommodate the population after a catastrophic earthquake because the profitability of land has encouraged building development.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards new construction, the quality of materials and the reliability of builders’ must be verified, as human lives are sometimes disregarded in the interests of greater profit, as we know from earthquakes in Greece. Special protection measures must first be applied in areas of higher seismic risk. These are essentially densely built-up areas that are deprived socially, economically and in terms of housing.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is right that there should be Community aid for restoration. This is the people’s money. The government will also have to adhere to procedures adapted to the soil and housing conditions of the area in order to provide the greatest possible earthquake protection and improvement of residential buildings.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Vakalis, and thank the Commissioner, Mr Dimas, for the hope he is giving us for the future.</p>
      <p sl="el">You can escape from fire, Mr President, and if you can swim, you can get away from floods. In an earthquake, you can only hope to have God on your side. Since this concerns our metaphysical aims and hopes, it would be good to have the EU on our side. Sometimes, unfortunately, we do not, because we have seen the Solidarity Fund activated for only one earthquake incident, whereas in cases of flood and fire, it showed great willingness. We understand, of course, that according to regulations, the damage should exceed 3 billion, but the houses that fall are not those of Onassis or Bill Gates; they are the homes of the poor. We can therefore bypass the regulations. Since the Mediterranean region has often suffered intolerable ordeals verging on unfair physical punishment, we are calling, if possible, for the activation of the Structural Development Fund, the Solidarity Fund (provided its strict rules can be moderated), the European Regional Development Fund and also the Civil Protection Fund. This will permit the funding of vital research programmes and also allow the repair of damage, wherever this can humanly and fairly be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent report by our colleague Mr Vakalis links in seamlessly to the three reports on natural disasters adopted by Parliament last year and is an important addition to them, for these previous reports did not deal with the issue of earthquakes. We know, however, that many countries and regions – especially in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region — have a high risk of earthquakes. I therefore endorse the rapporteur's call for the Commission to draw up a communication evaluating the hazards posed by earthquakes and proposing the counter- and follow-up measures necessary to address them, as it recently did in the case of floods.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question of financing is key, of course, and as the rapporteur on the Solidarity Fund, I cannot understand why the Council is still dragging its feet on – indeed, has in effect shelved – the adaptation of the Solidarity Fund, which this House has endorsed. Immediate action is required here to ensure that this solidarity and funding instrument is available in future so that the damage caused by natural disasters, including earthquakes, can be remedied quickly, efficiently and flexibly. Without this flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetables and measures for funding, it has been shown in the past that the needs of earthquake victims have been virtually ignored.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must consider – as the previous speaker has said – that the Solidarity Fund that is currently still in place has only been used once in relation to earthquake damage. However, earthquakes are just as much natural disasters as floods, forest fires and storms. There are other forms of financing, in addition to direct funding, which should be used as well, however, such as regional state subsidies or loans from the European Investment Fund. This is the only way to ensure that appropriate resources are available to tackle earthquakes. The report makes a good contribution to this process.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the earthquake in Friaul 30 years ago killed more than 3 000 people and is something which I still remember very vividly. The images of the destruction, caused within a matter of seconds, and the race against time to free the injured from the rubble are something I will never forget. It is therefore especially welcome that the European Parliament is dealing with this important issue. Without the unstinting commitment of rescue workers – including volunteers from neighbouring countries – this type of earthquake disaster is almost impossible to cope with, for only swift assistance is helpful.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite that fact, there is still very little cooperation in the EU on research regarding earthquake risks and no common mechanism at European level for crisis intervention. Binding rules for cross-border cooperation are needed and the cooperation with emergency relief organisations must be stepped up. I welcome the proposal to incorporate Eurocode 8 instructions in the planning regulations of vulnerable countries. In most European countries at present there is no legal basis for the assessment of major building structures, but it is those public buildings of strategic importance for civil protection and other critical infrastructures which, in the event of a disaster, must remain undamaged and operational and which require special protection. The assessment of important buildings must therefore be incorporated as a key element in the regional programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, may I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the reconstruction that has been carried out by the people affected by these disasters. They are a good example of how, through their own efforts, there is hope of a better future even after total destruction. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur sincerely for his work.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by recalling Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s words that there is no point arguing with an earthquake. Although 150 years old, these words still hold true today. As described in the report by Mr Vakalis, we must learn to live with earthquakes and be completely prepared for them. I would like to commend the rapporteur for his laying down practical instructions and showing us the way forward.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There is no doubt that an earthquake is a destructive phenomenon. According to estimates by geo-physicians and historians, since the dawn of civilisation earthquakes have claimed the lives of 150 million people. Fully half of the human population today live in areas with seismic activity. In Europe, earthquakes might not always have catastrophic consequences; however, we still need to be protected from them. An earthquake reaching just 5 on the Richter scale can be dangerous in that it causes loose objects to fall, roofing to cave in, buildings to be negatively affected and gas and water services to be damaged.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I personally believe that the steps taken recently to eliminate the negative impact of earthquakes are the correct ones. They include: introduction of a single emergency phone number; construction of integrated emergency systems; promotion of international cooperation; and exchange of information between rescue forces. We need to follow up on these steps by continuously strengthening the cooperation of rescue forces in neighbouring regions and countries, improving the qualifications and skills of civil protection experts, ensuring widespread use of information technologies and promoting training for, and simulation of, possible disasters.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We should not aim for the impossible, for example setting up common bodies or harmonising legislation. Rather we should focus on the flaws in the existing system. Last but not least, we need to realise that earthquakes are just one form of natural disasters, like floods, fires or drought, and that the problem of natural disasters should be dealt with as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="sl">They say that a friend in need is a friend indeed. A region where a powerful or even catastrophic earthquake has occurred naturally requires rapid and effective European Union assistance, particularly where the country concerned is itself unable to provide such assistance in full.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In view of the frequency of earthquakes in Europe, the number of victims and the material damage involved, it is highly unlikely that resources from a solidarity fund to assist the victims of earthquakes would be used only once. The catastrophic fire in Greece demonstrated that the European Union is not sufficiently well organised to deal with such disasters.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I agree with the proposal that we should invest greater resources in research into improved seismic risk monitoring, and funds for that purpose have already been provided in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research. It is also prudent to cooperate with countries which already have extensive knowledge and experience in this field.</p>
      <p sl="sl">A strategic plan for dealing with earthquakes, rapid response, coordinated rescue and cross-border assistance can save a large number of human lives. Naturally, advanced measures can also prevent many problems. Who could imagine Brussels without the Grand Place, Paris without the Eiffel Tower, or London without Buckingham Palace? Every country and region has its jewels and cultural heritage which it must protect as much as possible against earthquakes. Standards for earthquake-proof building must also be complied with consistently, in particular in areas with a high level of seismic activity.</p>

      <p sl="el">The Commission supports the approval of the report on the regional impact of earthquakes. Citizens expect the Member States and institutional bodies to act effectively and in a spirit of solidarity when faced with disasters. The prevention of environmental damage and damage caused by human activity entails the strengthening and development of civil protection resources and capabilities at local, national and European level. The Commission is confident that Parliament will continue to endorse and support this aim in the future.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that on 22 and 23 November, the Commission is holding its second civil protection forum in Brussels. The forum will be attended by approximately 500 participants who work in the field of civil protection or have an interest in it. It will enable participants to exchange ideas and will give them a chance to meet others who share their interest in civil protection and who work in the same field. I therefore call on my fellow Members to take part in the forum and meet the civil protection community.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Tectonic movements are manifested not only by earthquakes but also by volcanic eruptions. In addition, the effects of these natural hazards can be aggravated, notably by land movements and tsunamis.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-432" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Cornillet and congratulating him on his report, which identifies perfectly the challenges facing the humanitarian effort, and in particular on the fact that he also identifies perfectly the approaches to be taken in relation to European humanitarian action. This report is a vital contribution to the joint work by Parliament, the Council and the Commission to put in place the future European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid. Our common objective is to formalise in a joint declaration by the three institutions our vision and our common approach to humanitarian aid policy. There is no doubt in my mind that the active involvement of the European Parliament is essential for the success of this process to adopt the declaration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to reiterate very briefly the reason for this political initiative: basically, the humanitarian context has changed in recent years and we need to adapt to it if we want our humanitarian action to continue to be coherent and effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are the main changes and what are the main challenges? In my opinion, they can be summed up as follows. Firstly, there are more and more conflicts and natural disasters and their death toll is also rising. In particular, the natural disasters are often caused by climate change: the recent floods in Mexico reflect the reality and extent of this worrying trend.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we are also witnessing an increase in complex crises and significant changes in the nature of conflicts. The methods and means used in armed conflicts, for example, make the work of humanitarian organisations more and more complicated. The risks of attacks and pillaging of aid are also unfortunate daily realities, be they in Darfur or Somalia, Sri Lanka or Myanmar, Colombia or eastern DRC. We are also increasingly the witnesses of systematic violations of international humanitarian law and, consequently, restrictions of humanitarian values.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is a constant risk of confusion between the political and humanitarian agendas. I firmly believe that the European Union, as the largest global donor – I think it is important to reiterate that together we account for 40% of global humanitarian aid – but also as a political pillar of international law and multilateralism has, as far as I am concerned, a particular responsibility to ensure effective and adequate humanitarian aid. We can, and we must, act as a political catalyst and be a political benchmark and reference, too. That is the context in which, almost a year ago, we decided to launch the initiative to reach an explicit consensus on humanitarian aid at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These concerns are clearly reflected in Mr Cornillet’s report and I naturally support the key elements that the European Parliament wishes to underline and defend in the preparation of a European humanitarian consensus. This consensus and appropriate monitoring involving all 27 EU Member States and the Community will for the first time provide a common political core of values, objectives and principles, supported by the Member States and the Commission, which will help to improve the complementarity and coordination of the work of the Member States and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are the main elements of the draft consensus? The first is respect for humanitarian principles: humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence. You are of course well aware of what is entailed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second is the need to strengthen respect for, and application of, international humanitarian aid law at international level. Let me tell you a brief anecdote in this respect. I will not mention the country but I remember, not too long ago, I was in a particularly dramatic theatre of operations from a humanitarian perspective. I was putting questions to one of the country’s senior figures, who was responsible for what was happening there, and I said to him: ‘You are not complying with international humanitarian law’. He gave me a truly terrible response: ‘That is true, but this is a time of war’. It is evident that international humanitarian law is designed precisely for times of war. You can therefore imagine the extent to which we are in fact moving further and further away from it, in some way without any reaction, or moving further and further away from the most basic standards in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, we need to improve donors’ practices and methods as well as the quality of the partnership with the humanitarian organisations in order to make the aid provided more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly, there must be a voluntary commitment from the Member States to strengthen the complementarity and coordination of our humanitarian actions, and this is of course all the more necessary with enlargement bringing us up to 27 Member States. The future consensus will also have to provide a general framework to define the relationship between humanitarian aid and the EU’s other external policies. The ultimate goal is to make the EU’s humanitarian action more consistent and more effective. All of this will make a significant contribution to strengthening the international system under the aegis of the United Nations and this is a point that I would like to emphasise. The move to promote a European approach is evidently not aimed at weakening or competing with the central role of the United Nations. On the contrary: it will serve to reinforce this central role, and it is sad to see at times some reticence about this European consensus on the grounds that it would be in competition with the United Nations. That is absolutely not the case. The opposite is true: it aims to strengthen the European pillar within the framework of the United Nations, and this goes without saying.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The draft text of the declaration on the consensus clearly refers to the elements of the consensus that will to some extent form the European Union’s humanitarian doctrine in the future. I would like to thank Parliament and the Portuguese Presidency for their work during the negotiations on this text. We are now reaching the final stages of this trilateral procedure, which should enable us to fulfil the ambition of having all three institutions sign a joint declaration on 18 December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This declaration on the consensus is but the beginning of a process. It not an end in itself, but the beginning of a process. We know that this approach is going to require considerable efforts to ensure that our words become actions. To this end, at the start of next year we are going to present an action plan for the implementation of the future humanitarian consensus. Over these months of debate to prepare the consensus, the European Parliament has put forward some very specific suggestions, and we feel that it is entirely appropriate to incorporate them in the action plan, such as your proposal to draw up a humanitarian aid atlas based on the model of the development atlas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to add a few comments on two subjects of particular interest to the Members of this House. They relate to quasi-philosophical elements of humanitarian aid, which are today at the centre of certain debates and which are, moreover, elements of the goal of humanitarian aid itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is the issue of the ‘responsibility to protect’. Following Parliament’s suggestion, we highlighted in the draft text of the consensus the commitments made in this respect by countries within the framework of the UN and the international community. I should point out that humanitarian action and the responsibility to protect are based on two different approaches, even though they have an important point in common, namely stopping human suffering. We must avoid any confusion between these two approaches because it could damage the image of the humanitarian actors as neutral and independent, something that is vital for us to be able to help people affected by humanitarian crises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The concept of the responsibility to protect is still relatively ambiguous. This concept, in the past and even today, is very closely linked to the idea of the right of interference and military intervention for humanitarian purposes in extreme circumstances, for example to prevent genocide. However, that interpretation is precisely the reason why some regimes reject the concept of the responsibility to protect: they see it as a political cover for Westerners to justify their imperialism, to justify interventions founded not on humanitarian interests but on a desire for power. At times there is confusion between this doctrine of the responsibility to protect and protective humanitarian action, which, inter alia , is traditionally part of the mandate of the ICRC. We fully support the latter activity through our humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Cornillet’s report also raises a very relevant question regarding the institutional framework for debating humanitarian policy. Parliament has appointed a Permanent Rapporteur for Humanitarian Aid, and we congratulate it on that. The report rightly raises the issue of such representatives in the Council. On behalf of the Commission, we gratefully acknowledge the considerable efforts of the Portuguese Presidency to give the Council the time needed for the preparation of the consensus in the development working group. The institutional decision to set up a Council group to focus on humanitarian policy is of course down to the Member States, but I agree entirely with Mr Cornillet that it is vital to establish an appropriate body to tackle systematically humanitarian issues on an equal footing with the Union’s other external policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Humanitarian aid is neutral and independent of any political or other objectives but that does not mean that politics are not involved in any way. On the contrary, the elements and actors that threaten humanitarian values are political in nature. The Lisbon Treaty clearly recognises that humanitarian aid is a separate chapter of our international action and I feel that this should be reflected in an institutional structure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In that regard, I must say that I feel that there is a growing trend – which I am not denouncing yet because there is no reason to denounce it when nothing dubious is going on – to believe, for example, that the logistical capacities of armies could quite easily, to some extent, be more closely involved in the humanitarian field.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will not reject anything out of hand, but I will say, however, that we should reject any interference by a sector that does not have a humanitarian purpose. I can understand that in certain specific cases military logistics are used to assist humanitarian actions. However, I will not deny that I, personally, would prefer such actions to be the political responsibility of foreign ministers, as is the case in certain countries, instead of them being carried out under the aegis of one or more defence ministers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This debate will continue, but I feel that it is more and more common to see in the humanitarian field sectors or logistics – corpora – that can undeniably cause confusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, Mr President, Mr Cornillet, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with the European Community’s considerable contribution to the humanitarian effort and in particular I pay tribute to all the men and women who work on the ground in very difficult circumstances to provide humanitarian aid to those who need it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I firmly believe that this consensus should allow for more systematic, coordinated action. It is to some extent the basis of the doctrine, the founding principles and it genuinely offers a framework for permanent coordination at European level. On the basis of this future consensus, we can become much more effective, which is after all the objective.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will try not to repeat the excellent points the Commissioner has just made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are evolving in a completely new landscape. Insofar as the Constitution had provided for it and the simplified Treaty will incorporate it, we are going to put together a full Union policy, the humanitarian aid policy, and, as the Commissioner stated, we are the world’s largest source of aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It in this landscape that this report must be examined. It is not just a response to a Commission communication; it is a working document on the consensus achieved with my colleagues. For the first time the three institutions are going to publish a joint document. It is the first time since the adoption of the Regulation on humanitarian aid in 1996. It was time for a well thought-out text that provides a general political declaration on humanitarian aid for our three institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to emphasise the excellent collaboration involved in this discussion, both in the Committee on Development, where my report was unanimously adopted, and with the European Commission and the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to emphasise that the Members of this House supported 12 specific points, plus a budgetary point. I would like to outline them here in order to explain, first of all, the extent to which we support them and why, and in particular to say that these points were incorporated in the consensus and that the European Parliament was pleased with all of the points it requested.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the first point, closely linked to the previous topic of natural disasters, we wanted to see a new definition of humanitarian action because of course there are armed conflicts that, by their very nature, cannot necessarily be predicted and there are disasters that, paradoxically, are starting to become predictable, as a result of climate change in particular. We know that in some countries there are going to be disasters, even if we do not know when exactly: the floods in South-East Asia are one example. We thus hope that the boundaries of humanitarian action can be put in place much earlier, with training of personnel and pre-positioning. Then, at a later stage, we can clearly see the grey area that can exist between what is still part of the humanitarian effort but is already becoming reconstruction and will eventually become development assistance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We were very firm in our belief that these boundaries should be extended, and this would have budgetary implications, which I will discuss later. Another important element of these boundaries, as far as Parliament is concerned, are the forgotten crises, which are forgotten in the minds of the public, but not forgotten by those who live in the midst of them. For example, in Colombia there are almost as many displaced people as there are in Darfur, and that is something that warrants our attention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point is of course the definition of humanitarian aid and its principles, which were reiterated by the Commissioner: humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence. The consensus defines these principles for action, on which our institution’s humanitarian action is based.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we highlighted the most vulnerable groups, with specific reference to women, gender and the specific role women play in the field of humanitarian action. We also wanted to emphasise the role of local actors and civil society. I will come back to this topic when discussing food aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the use of military resources – and the Commissioner was very clear on this – military resources, especially logistical resources – I am of course thinking of helicopters that that can be crucial in a front-line intervention in a natural disaster – can only be used as a last resort and within the framework of a mandate, so that their use is extremely clearly defined. There is always the risk that they are party to the conflict or considered to be party to an armed conflict, and it is thus important to look at this in great detail. The same applies to civil protection: here, too, we hope that the use of civil protection assets will always be an exception and take place within the boundaries of a clear framework to ensure that the humanitarian effort does not become blurred by the intervention of actors who are not directly front-line actors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here in the European Parliament we obviously support the reforms within the UN, with one stipulation, Commissioner. We hope that the funds to be allocated to the CERF are additional funds. There is no reason why our institutions should be deprived of the ability to be a driving force through the ECHO Directorate-General in particular. If the Member States or other donors want to contribute to the United Nations funds for front-line intervention, that must not be to the detriment of what is already being done and should be over and above this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another aspect that is very important to us is food aid. It has naturally been incorporated in the humanitarian aid framework, but we wanted to emphasise that it can sometimes have a harmful impact by disrupting local markets. When food aid is offered but not properly thought out, it can violate the primo non nocere principle: ‘do not harm’. It is important to learn from the example of other countries that are very well-known for this in their humanitarian actions so as not to make the same mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I want to talk about the responsibility to protect. What the Commissioner said was extremely important and we fully support your comments on the right of interference and the need to stop and think, and on complete respect for the humanitarian effort, which should possibly result in consideration of sanctions at EU level. We have at last secured our representative and thank you for pointing that out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We simply want this consensus report to incorporate not just a set of principles but also a roadmap with which we will have – and this has been agreed – an annual meeting so that Parliament, too, can play a full role.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs supports Commissioner Michel's proposal for an interinstitutional declaration on the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, but the individual governments of the 27 Member States are still pursuing national policy goals on humanitarian aid, which sometimes differ substantially from Europe's goals.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council and the Member States must make humanitarian aid a moral and political imperative, inspired more by the effectiveness of that aid than by national or post-colonial interests. We cannot confine ourselves to distributing rice and bread, however necessary that may be. The EU’s humanitarian aid must be accompanied by political and diplomatic activity that makes compliance with international law, especially international humanitarian law, a priority for the so-called recipient state. The principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence must be safeguarded and kept distinct from any active military intervention in the field of humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="it">Failure to comply with these principles could be prejudicial both to humanitarian workers and to the populations concerned. It is important to remember, too, that in humanitarian aid operations particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups such as women and children.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomed the communication from the European Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union entitled ‘Towards a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should bear in mind that the European Union is the largest donor of humanitarian aid in the world. In 2006 it allocated EUR 2 billion to humanitarian aid. These funds brought relief to more than 100 million individuals in 75 countries around the world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also the case that the European Union's potential is not being fully exploited. This is confirmed by the latest OECD report, which points to structural inadequacies and to certain paradoxes relating to the European Union's activities. A joint and unambiguous declaration by the three largest institutions of the European Union is an exceptional opportunity to achieve a political consensus on the way in which the European Union should react to the increasingly complex crisis situations emerging around the world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The declaration will allow us to establish a framework and definition of humanitarian aid and to lay down the European Union's principles and strategies regarding the provision of aid to those most in need. Furthermore, the declaration will help to establish and present a single European Union stance at fora involving a range of humanitarian organisations. In addition, it will allow us to draw attention to the fact that the European Union does not focus only on awarding humanitarian aid, but is also involved in analysing the reasons why such aid is required.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Whenever possible, we endeavour to assist in finding appropriate political solutions through which to eliminate the aforementioned reasons. I believe that Mr Cornillet, the rapporteur, has provided an excellent analysis of the complex and complicated context in which humanitarian aid has been granted over the last 15 years. Commissioner Michel also referred to this complexity today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Circumstances are changing and, as a result, the European Union and the international community as a whole are now facing new challenges. The changes include a fundamental difference in the nature of armed conflicts, and more frequent occurrence of natural disasters whose effects are increasingly painful. The number of internal conflicts is also growing, resulting in a higher number of refugees. In many places international humanitarian law is being ignored or deliberately infringed. Workers attached to international humanitarian organisations are under increasing threat. More and more entities are involved in the provision of humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore agree with the rapporteur that complementarity, coherence, effectiveness and coordination of humanitarian aid at technical and political level between the 25 Member States of the Union is essential. Indeed, it is a sine qua non to enhancing the European Union's status as the main international donor of humanitarian aid. It is also necessary for the development of a strong European policy in the context of international institutions, a policy more appropriate to the budgetary resources made available by the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should also like to refer to the so-called duty of protection. I support the rapporteur's opinion that the European Union should take the lead in making the notion of this duty a reality. It involves giving priority to diplomatic and preventive action, supporting governments as they fulfil their obligation to protect their own people, and applying appropriate pressure where necessary. The latter could include diplomatic and economic sanctions. The use of force such as military intervention should be a last resort, and should only be used in exceptional cases, whilst fully respecting international law and complying with it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank our colleague Mr Cornillet for his work on this report and for the debates he led in our Committee on Development. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his pertinent analysis at the beginning of this debate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report on humanitarian aid rightly focuses on the protection of humanitarian personnel and access to victims, which are the two major issues that humanitarian aid must tackle now and will have to tackle increasingly in the future. In this respect, I would like to point out, as the Commissioner did, that the changes in the way the armed forces are used can blur the image of humanitarian actors. The confusion caused by the use of military resources, at times to accompany humanitarian workers, inevitably results in NGOs and their teams losing the immunity they used to have in the field.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, in order to reach victims and demand a certain freedom of expression, it is crucial not to appear to be involved in these conflicts or dependent on the policies of the organisations’ countries of origin. In conflict areas the recent changes have made the perception of NGO positioning more complex. In Darfur, in particular, several international NGOs, including Médecins du Monde , say that it is becoming more and more difficult for them to reach the victims outside the camps for the displaced and that there is a fresh upsurge of violence against the people and humanitarian workers. Their room for manoeuvre is dependent on reaffirming their independence in relation to the armed forces involved on the ground and any political positioning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also important to note that an increasing proportion of the financial resources of humanitarian NGOs comes from financial institutions, particularly European institutions. This situation can also reinforce mistrust of these NGOs, which can sometimes see their action confused with the geo-strategic positions of the donor countries or the Union. For that reason, I wish to stress here that the increase in public funding, which we welcome and which is an excellent thing, must not, however, lead to these NGOs being used as pawns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the last 10 years more than 1 000 humanitarian workers have been killed in more than 500 attacks on civilian aid operations. If we do not make every effort to guarantee the independence of NGOs, their capacity for action will undoubtedly decrease and, consequently, the number of areas in which international humanitarian law is applied will be vastly reduced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The media approach means that today the whole world is focusing on Zoe’s Ark, which is an extremely small amateur association compared with the vast majority of humanitarian operations, which are carried out by recognised structures whose staff have great courage and human and professional qualities. This isolated case must not therefore be allowed to discredit all humanitarian aid actors. On the contrary, it reminds us that it is essential for humanitarian operations to be carried out strictly in accordance with international humanitarian law and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore welcome the fact that this European consensus, which will be adopted at the next part-session, encompasses our request for the creation in the Council of a formal structure that is specifically responsible for humanitarian issues, and for an annual review of the consensus and its accompanying action plan.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first I would like to refer to paragraph 21 of Mr Cornillet’s report, which considers that the consensus should recognise and further define the different roles, mandates and comparative advantages of the various humanitarian actors.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of the new Member States, there are some countries, including my own, which could perform most efficiently when cooperating with the others, pooling their skills and resources and sharing individual know-how. When put into practice, this could benefit a lot of the humanitarian activities of the EU and enable the new Member States to become further involved in European policies. However, the European Union should be ready to start centralising its agencies to coordinate its activities in the best possible way.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point that I would like to make is that the contribution of the new Member States to humanitarian aid tends to be rather modest. The new Member States that relied on development assistance and humanitarian aid nearly two decades ago now luxuriate in rapid economic growth. I encourage those countries to increase their contribution vigorously and remember that this is a chance to assist less-developed countries in the same way that the developed world lent them a hand not so long ago.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the conviction that it is a moral obligation to provide humanitarian aid to the victims of crisis situations is currently widespread amongst European societies. We should be proud that the European Union is the largest donor of aid.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nonetheless, due to the scale of natural disasters and other crisis situations it often happens that the aid is inadequate, or that there are delays in granting it. Sometimes the aid fails to reach those most in need. The effectiveness of aid could be greatly improved through good organisation, including cooperation with other aid donors, clear principles and unambiguous criteria. It is important to coordinate humanitarian aid with development assistance. This provides an opportunity for recipients to become self-sufficient, which means they will not be dependent on aid in the future. That is why a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid is so important. Another relevant consideration is the need for volunteers to be protected against violence.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are discussing today emphasises that the humanitarian activity of the EU must be governed by principles, as defined by the rules and good practice relating to humanitarian aid. When we read something like this, we may well wonder about the two-faced role of the EU, which gives with one hand and takes with the other. Palestine is a case in point. Here we are giving money in order to vaunt our humanitarianism, while at the same time our foreign policy marginalises 1.5 million people both economically and socially, giving them no hope of improvement in the future. The moral lesson of this should be that humanitarian aid without a realistic foreign policy makes no sense: the two go hand in hand. It is time the Commission woke up to this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in recent years there have been many humanitarian crises and as many emergency aid programmes. Every day, people are suffering from food shortages and disease; every year there are numerous natural disasters which leave thousands without shelter and a way back to regular life.</p>
      <p sl="de">The principal issues in crises like these are securing the safety of the area and of the people, attending to medical needs and providing food, water and shelter. These immediate issues are primary and all efforts should be directed towards them. Unfortunately, victims have limited access to humanitarian aid, and humanitarian aid workers’ lives are being put at risk, due to the rising internal conflict in some countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sometimes, after the immediate crisis is over and the aid ends, the suffering can again become acute because nothing has been put in place to help people rebuild and be independent in the long run. This is our most important duty: that of aiding others in their time of greatest need. Problems with this cannot be allowed to continue and we must find another way to help in both the short and the long term.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I congratulate Mr Cornillet on his extremely professional report on humanitarian aid. The need for this type of aid is not diminishing; on the contrary, natural disasters are growing in number and scope. Armed conflicts in developing countries have not decreased; they have merely changed in character. Humanitarian workers often face attacks or other acts that violate international law. A total of 40% of worldwide humanitarian assistance was provided by Europeans directly through the Member States or through the EU. Last year alone this aid amounted to EUR 2 billion. This is enough for us to strive for a more effective provision of aid. We are aware that it should be systematic and well coordinated with other actors.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I agree that humanitarian aid should be also linked to development assistance. It should also go hand in hand with political and diplomatic activities, notably to protect humanitarian workers and to ensure that they reach the areas of intervention.</p>
      <p sl="cs">An interesting figure on humanitarian aid provision shows that nine out of ten Europeans are in favour of it. Half of them believe that humanitarian aid is more effective if provided at EU level as opposed to national level. It is therefore logical that humanitarian aid has this year become an EU policy area in its own right. This is, of course, also a great commitment. We need to be aware that humanitarian aid is not a crisis management tool: it should avoid having any effect on local politics or markets and remain independent of political circumstances. This is why I fully identify with the principles for its provision such as humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, immediacy and effectiveness. I support, too, the idea of the Central Emergency Response Fund, because disasters always require speedy intervention. I am also in favour of a common EU framework for needs assessment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to add my congratulations to our rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, for his hard and valuable work on this very complex issue. I would also like to welcome Commissioner Michel and to underline his call for good cooperation with our Committee on Development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European consensus on humanitarian aid will play a very important role for development in humanitarian policies. I think it is very relevant that it is jointly agreed by the Council, Parliament and the Commission. In doing so, we seek to confirm our commitment to the humanitarian principles and to put in place a foundation for working together more closely to ensure the most effective implementation of EU humanitarian aid in the years to come and help the many people who are suffering in humanitarian crises.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a member of the Development Committee, I am pleased that the final text includes key elements such as an explicit mention of the UN resolution on the responsibility to protect and takes into account the specific needs of vulnerable populations, with special attention to children, women, the elderly, and sick and disabled people. The possibility of a yearly revision of humanitarian aid provisions is also mentioned in the text, a very important item that allows for a humanitarian response based on funding adequate to the needs. Furthermore, the text mentions the idea of using local support capacities and NGOs active in the field, which allows the use of expertise and knowledge of local conditions for a faster and better response to humanitarian emergencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must not forget that those who suffer most from disasters, natural or man-made, are those who are already in fragile situations due to poverty. They live mainly in developing countries and have few possibilities for a better life. It is important, therefore, that the European Union sends a message of solidarity and support. For this to happen, a proper, quick and effective response in the event of humanitarian emergencies is essential. Better coordination is also essential to achieving better linkage between relief, rehabilitation and development in order to ensure that the aftermath of a disaster claims as few human lives as possible.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a well-balanced report on a very important subject. Few matters are more important for our Union than being able to respond, and respond forcefully, when war breaks out or when natural catastrophes occur. The EU has the will and the ability, but more is needed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let me touch on two sensitive points. First, in certain cases it is, in my opinion, reasonable to be able to use military action to protect humanitarian efforts. In Darfur, direct armed protection is needed to guarantee the humanitarian efforts. Here we must primarily consider the result – saving lives.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Second, aid can be used to promote democratic development. Here we must also consider the results. Let me give a concrete example which the Commissioner knows well. In Eritrea a Swedish journalist has been in prison for more than six years simply because he exercised his freedom of speech. Thirty Swedish managing editors are currently demanding that a link be made between Swedish aid and the imprisonment of David Isaak, which is the journalist’s name. I am inclined to stand by them. Eritrea should know that the willingness to provide aid can disappear if democratic principles are abused as flagrantly as they are in Eritrea today.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, a much needed and valuable text has lost already some of its value in the title: geographically, the EU is only one part of Europe, unless negotiations on the Commission proposal have already commenced with European countries outside the EU such as Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Serbia, Belarus and others, which of course is not the case. I support the adoption of this excellent and much-needed resolution. However, how will we ensure that it is observed in our transatlantic neighbours’ prisons in Guantánamo or in Afghanistan? Or do we agree with their practices, in the context of a deepening of the Transatlantic Partnership? Yes, the resolution is necessary and correct. Let us reflect, however, on ways of encouraging our transatlantic partners to recognise and apply the humanitarian principles. Otherwise, we will be striving to solve issues triggered by others.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would briefly like to thank you for the very broad support for Mr Cornillet’s reports and the Commission’s positions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The response to forgotten crises is precisely a better division of work. It is clear that if there is no division of work and humanitarian aid or development are dependent on political opportunity, on a country’s foreign policy, you will naturally have forgotten crises and orphan countries; hence the division of work is the only response.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The idea of a humanitarian atlas, for example, like the development atlas, which is making excellent progress and has already been implemented, is clearly a good solution. I also agree with the many speakers who referred to the need to emphasise the crucial role of local actors and the involvement of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the CERF, I completely agree – and I have said this on several occasions to the United Nations, to OCHA, to everyone, and you know my position on it – ECHO will not contribute to the CERF unless additional funds are available. Each year ECHO spends everything it has available for humanitarian actions, and if an ECHO contribution were to be necessary it should be in addition to this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, in reality ECHO is a European CERF. It is important to remember this. Thus there is no great need for it. ECHO is just as flexible – I dream of having the same flexibility in the development sector – and perhaps even more flexible than the CERF. Thirdly, I would like the UN to concentrate on its core business in relation to humanitarian aid, which is essentially the coordination of humanitarian aid and that is where OCHA comes in. There is important work to be done in that regard, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Hutchinson asked a very important question about the description, or to some extent the label – even if that is a dangerous word – given to NGOs and civil society actors. I agree with him that we cannot of course hold NGOs up to public opprobrium because of one association or another. I should mention in passing that the Commission has never contributed to Zoe’s Ark, nor has it ever financed it or used it as an operator, and I want you to know that so that there is no misunderstanding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, the question you raise makes me think of a question that we should perhaps discuss with the NGOs – and I have already had the opportunity to talk about it – namely the creation of a high authority of NGOs and civil society actors, which would consist exclusively of NGO and civil society representatives. There is therefore no provision for public authorities to be represented in this high authority, and I saw that Bernard Kouchner reacted to this proposal. It could to some extent be modelled on what is know as the medical association or the professional association, for example, which themselves resolve a number of problems that might otherwise arise, on the basis of a code of practice and ethics. That is one suggestion that I am putting forward, although it would be worth looking into it in detail.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the new Member States are concerned, I am very pleased to note that there is high degree of willingness, especially among some of them – and the Czech Republic comes to mind in particular – to demonstrate international solidarity through greater humanitarian aid in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also important to point out that six Member States (of EU25) alone provide 49% of the European Union’s total aid and that the share of the other 19 Member States accounts for 18% of the total. Thus the commitment in the humanitarian field is far from balanced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards Palestine, I do not believe that the European Union is giving with one hand and taking with the other. There are of course questions surrounding the fact that our development assistance and, in particular, our humanitarian aid are often held to ransom by the situation in Palestine, but I do not feel that the European Union, and certainly not the Commission, deserve to be accused of taking back as much as they have given.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make a short comment, Mr Schmidt, on humanitarian aid in Eritrea. There is no humanitarian aid in Eritrea; we do not spend a cent on humanitarian aid there. I presume you are confusing it with development assistance. In our political dialogue with Eritrea, the issue of the journalist that you mentioned is always on the agenda. I called, in fact I met, Issaias and spoke to him about this issue. He is hiding behind the fact that the problem is strictly a matter of Eritrean law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I obviously share your point of view and your position on this matter, but linking development assistance to this issue is extremely dangerous. If you tie the journalist’s release, for example, to a political decision, if you tie your development assistance to this issue, who will suffer? Not the Eritrean authorities, but the people you want to help, in other words the population.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is slightly more complicated than you seem to think. We cannot necessarily tie such issues together. Even though they are highly distressing issues, which I worry about and which are a permanent topic in our dialogue – and I am constantly applying pressure to try to get this problem resolved – we cannot tie them to the granting of development assistance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any event, as far as humanitarian aid is concerned, I can tell you that there is no European humanitarian aid in Eritrea, although we do finance development projects there.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome this initiative by the institutions to establish an EU Consensus on Humanitarian Aid. It will provide, for the first time, a clear statement of EU policy regarding humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">The environment where humanitarian action is taking place is evolving rapidly and continually poses new challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are increasing numbers of vulnerable people in crisis situations and in natural disasters. In 2003 there were 200 million people affected, with 45 million people in need of life-saving assistance. Since then we have had the Asian tsunami, numerous earthquakes, floods and hurricanes affecting Central America and the horrific situation in Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Consensus will underline the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Development assistance is a crucial link to preventing humanitarian emergencies. Disaster risk reduction and a clear commitment to link relief, rehabilitation and development are essential.</p>
      <p sl="en">Military forces have become increasingly involved in the provision of relief and reconstruction assistance to civilian populations. Such encroachment into what has traditionally been seen as humanitarian or development space raises important questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The distinction between civilian and military actors is a concern for many working in the humanitarian field. The mandates of the different actors must be clearly defined.</p>
