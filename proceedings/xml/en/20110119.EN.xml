      <p sl="en">First of all, I wish you a Happy New Year! As simple as that and I wish it for you personally and I wish it for our Union, in these difficult times. As the last European Council is already a month behind us, let me remind you that I already give a full report each time to your Conference of Presidents on the results of the European Council just a few hours after every meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the December European Council, we focused on the first day on economic issues and on the second day on foreign policy. On economic policy, we reached some important conclusions. First, we decided on the proposal for a limited Treaty amendment required to establish a permanent mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole. Following our agreement, in principle, in our October meeting that such a Treaty change is needed, I had consulted the members of the European Council about its possible wording and content. I secured agreement on a text consisting of two sentences, to be added to Article 136 of the Treaty. I quote:</p>
      <p sl="en">‘The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality’.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is an essential piece in our efforts to make Europe more crisis-proof. It is important, not just for legal certainty, but also for market credibility. As this amendment will not increase the competences of the Union, all members of the European Council agreed that it was appropriate to use a simplified revision procedure. This now requires an opinion from your Parliament, as well as from the European Commission and the Central Bank. We hope to secure your approval. I need hardly remind you of the importance of proceeding as rapidly and as smoothly as possible in this matter in a period where market volatility remains a concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that you, and your responsible committees, have been following this matter closely, not least during the work of the Task Force on Economic Governance which I chaired and which gave rise to meetings between myself and the seven chairs of the parliamentary committees most involved. I would like to thank President Buzek for his contribution on this at the European Council and for informing us of Parliament’s willingness to proceed quickly in considering this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the benefit of your opinion, the European Council will be able to turn this draft decision into a full decision at its March meeting. Then, the Treaty amendment will have to be approved in each Member State. The aim is for the amendment to enter into force on 1 January 2013 at the latest, so that the permanent mechanism itself can be in place in June 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council also examined what could be the key features of the future mechanism. Already in October, we had asked the Commission to undertake the preparatory work. This resulted in a statement by the Eurogroup Finance Ministers on 28 November, which was fully endorsed at the European Council meeting. It foresees that the future European Stability Mechanism will be designed on the basis of the current mechanism, so IMF involvement is provided for. The EU will continue to adhere strictly to standard IMF and international practices. Concerning the role of the private sector, decisions will be taken on a case-by-case basis, so private sector involvement will not be a prior requirement for support under the future Stability Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the European Council also had a very good and in-depth exchange of views on recent economic developments and on how to deal with the challenges for all European economies, short-term and long-term. The President of the Central Bank was also present and a statement by the Heads of State or Government of the eurozone and the EU institutions present was welcomed by the European Council. This discussion confirmed the sense of determination and unity amongst the Member States and the institutions. Everybody around the table shared the basic analysis. I insist: all 27 agree, even if the analysis focuses particularly on the current 17 euro countries. We thus have a joint will to make our economies more resistant to crises and to enhance structural economic growth in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me mention the elements of this joint approach, which reflects the statement adopted. Three points concern work to be done by the national governments: first, fiscal responsibility; second, stimulating growth; and third, the two countries with support programmes are forcefully implementing the necessary measures and we all welcome the efforts of those two governments, of Greece and Ireland, and their populations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two other points concern work to be done by the Member States and the institutions of the European Union together. Firstly, the European Council asks the other institutions, not least your Parliament, to make sure that the agreements reached in October, on the basis of the Task Force which I chaired, regarding the Stability Pact and macro-economic surveillance, are in place by the summer. It is our common duty. Secondly, we agree to conduct new stress tests in the banking sector to ensure full transparency in the broader context of the EU annual exercise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our determination is clear. The Heads of State or Government of the eurozone and the EU institutions ‘stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the eurozone as a whole’. Work is going on to develop these elements of this overall approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the second day of our meeting, we focused on our relations with strategic partners. Cathy Ashton presented progress reports on how to deal with strategic partners and I briefed colleagues about the positive outcome of three recent summit meetings, namely: the summit with President Obama, where we opened new avenues for transatlantic cooperation on growth, jobs and security, such as green growth and cyber-security; the summit with President Medvedev in which we reached the bilateral agreement on Russia’s WTO accession, a major achievement; and the summit with Prime Minister Singh of India, which showed good progress for an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement, hopefully with a result in the first semester of this year, and which also produced a joint declaration on international terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">These meetings all showed that, for our partners, the European Union is not only an economic union and a trade bloc, but also a geopolitical partner.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council also decided to give Montenegro the status of candidate country. It underlines the conviction within the European Council that the countries of the Western Balkans have a European vocation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we agreed also on the position on Côte d’Ivoire, in line with what the Ministers of Foreign Affairs decided a few days previously, sending a clear signal on the need to respect the results of democratic elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the European Council, on 4 February, will deal principally with our growth agenda. Innovation and energy – especially energy security – are key in this regard. In March, we will have our first exercise of what is called the European Semester. It must not be a bureaucratic process but a real occasion to have an in-depth discussion on the state of play of our economy and the actions to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, we know of course that we have to strengthen and deepen economic coordination and convergence inside the eurozone. We will work as much as possible in a comprehensive framework and I am convinced we will find the necessary consensus.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, last year, the European Union faced a series of stern tests and December’s European Council has shown just how determined we are to take whatever decisions are necessary to defend our achievements. In particular, by agreeing to establish a European Stability Mechanism and to make the linked Treaty change, we have demonstrated our total commitment to supporting the euro area and the Member States that use it for the benefit of the entire EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will adopt its formal opinion on the text of the Treaty change before the Spring European Council. We will certainly play our part in explaining to Europe’s citizens why this limited change deserves support. This agreement allows us to step up a gear and the Commission will work closely with Finance Ministers to iron out details of the permanent Stability Mechanism before the Spring European Council. Although this will be an intergovernmental mechanism, which was the only option the Member States could consider, it is important that it is set up in a manner fully consistent with the Treaty and that it reinforces our stability rules, in accordance with the principles and instruments of budgetary surveillance.</p>
      <p sl="en">These decisions are linked to the wider range of measures we are taking as part of our approach to dealing with both the economic crisis and its consequences and the need to generate growth with jobs. The European Council has recognised that. The Heads of State or Government of the euro area and the European institutions in particular have also made it clear that they stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole. In particular, the Heads called for determined action in ensuring the availability of adequate financial support through the European Financial Stability Facility pending the entry into force of the permanent mechanism. These were the conclusions of the last European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council also called for accelerated adoption by June of the Commission’s economic governance proposals from last September. It recognised the important role the Europe 2020 strategy will also have in returning Europe to sustainable growth. The European Union Semester, which we launched last week with the Annual Growth Survey, ties all these trends together. I believe it breaks new ground, improving decisively the way in which we manage and coordinate our interdependent economies in the European Union. It is bringing in genuine European economic governance. This is our new economic governance at work – governance that should be the comprehensive response to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has signalled this very clearly in the Annual Growth Survey. Let me just concentrate on that because I think, based also on the very important conclusions of the December European Council, it is now more important than ever to look at the next steps. I believe a new reality is emerging. The politics of economic governance and economic coordination have changed and this is not just because the so-called federalists wanted it. The markets want it. Our international partners want it. It is a matter of simple common sense and we are delivering it and will continue to deliver it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new European Semester combines tighter fiscal rules by reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact with effective economic coordination. It offers ex-ante coordination, which means we discuss each other’s policies, both economic and fiscal, before they are adopted. We are no longer looking back to introduce corrections, but are looking ahead to give guidance.</p>
      <p sl="en">This ex-ante approach is at the heart of what makes this a historic step for the European Union. Effectively, we are introducing a genuine European dimension into national budgetary and economic policy making. From now on, we will be helping to shape policies upfront rather than assessing and trying to correct them afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final decisions on national budgets will, of course, be taken by national parliaments. That is right and proper, but this new form of economic governance simply reflects a rational response to a new reality. When we see the level of interdependence in the euro area and the European Union as a whole, a country should be able to take decisions knowing what its neighbours intend to do. This sharing of information empowers and strengthens national parliaments. It does not undermine their authority.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Annual Growth Survey launches this process and its key messages are clear: bring back stability, do not delay structural reforms any longer, and speed up growth-enhancing measures. First, we need to re-establish stability by consolidating public finances. Unless we balance the books, we will not restore confidence in Europe’s economies. If we do not restore confidence, we will risk economic stagnation and all the negative social consequences that flow from that, especially for employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we have to approach this in a sober and well thought-out way. Fiscal consolidation does not mean reducing debt by taking a slash-and-burn approach to spending. It is more than anything a matter of prioritising and some areas – innovation, education, new forms of energy – are good candidates for such priority treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second key message from the Annual Growth Survey is to push forward with structural reforms so that we can create new job opportunities. The choice is a simple one: do we want jobless growth or growth with jobs? If the latter, then there are a few things we are going to have to do. We need to urge Member States to focus this year on labour market reform so that we can remove obstacles to higher employment levels. We need to help people get back to work or find new jobs by making work more attractive. We need to reform pension systems and make sure that the unemployed are not left worse-off when they find work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be quite clear: structural reform does not mean reducing our level of social protection, but it does mean bringing in those who are currently excluded from the labour market, especially our young people. Levels of youth unemployment in some Member States, even in good times, are a scandal. Anyone who truly cares about a social Europe knows this cannot continue. In the face of increased international competition, we can only sustain our social market economy if we adapt.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third key message in the Annual Growth Survey is to frontload and speed up measures that are growth enhancing. Our Europe 2020 programme is central to this. We must focus on measures that have clear economic benefits in the short to medium term and which lend themselves to relatively fast adoption. That means investing in areas that derive growth, unleashing the full potential of our single market, increasing investment in energy, transport and IT infrastructure – in part, through innovative financing, including, we believe, the European Union project bonds – and continuing to press for a conclusion of the Doha Round, while pushing forward free trade agreements with key partners. All of this needs to be reflected in the next multiannual financial framework proposal. Europe’s next budget must be a growth-enhancing budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ladies and gentlemen, our economies are starting to move in the right direction. The recovery has taken hold and is currently progressing in the real economy. This year, we should see GDP growth at around 1.5%, rising to 2% of GDP in 2012. Europe’s manufacturing sector has improved markedly in recent months. We should also see a steady improvement in employment prospects and we are starting to see public deficits decline, thanks primarily to the consolidation measures already taken, supported in some cases by a resumption of growth. In the European Union, the government deficit is expected to decline from 6.8% this year to 4.2% of GDP in 2012 on average.</p>
      <p sl="en">But to breathe a sigh of relief and slip back into bad habits would be a grave error. The world has changed. We cannot return to the old ways of doing things. If we do not act now, in the face of the biggest crisis since the beginning of European integration, when will Member States be ready to take real steps for economic policies that are consistent with the goals they have themselves set? If it is not us at European level, who will encourage them to take those decisions, who will do it? Only by sorting out our debt and stabilising finances can we move from crisis management to fostering growth – not any kind of growth of course, but sustainable, inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">That means structural reforms, many of which we have been advocating for several years – reforms that challenge all structures but do so to reduce prices and increase opportunities for new jobs and innovative ways of doing things. I really believe we have a responsibility towards our citizens to choose the path of growth with jobs. The Annual Growth Survey points the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let us now commit seriously to proper economic policy coordination and real common European economic governance for all our citizens. Thank you for your attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">[Applause]</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the last European Council clearly showed that the euro is a vital pillar of European integration. Everything possible must be done to stabilise and strengthen it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our Heads of State or Government have since confirmed their deep attachment to the European currency and the fact that Estonia is joining the euro area at the beginning of this year is yet another signal in this direction, as well as setting a very good example of how to respect standards to the major countries that fail to respect them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That said, no one underestimates the seriousness of what Europe is going through economically and socially within the euro area. Everything possible must be done in 2011 to overcome these problems and to reassure the markets, not superficially but structurally, in other words, by creating the right conditions for growth and employment in the long term. I think we are speaking the same language on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, this means that national public finances must be restored to better health. Push hard for this, let us not give in! Secondly, it means that the Member States must get their fiscal policies to converge more closely, and also their taxation and social policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It also means that we must come to a swift agreement on the euro area bail-out fund and that this fund only makes sense if it is backed up by strict enforcement of the fiscal discipline rules. Our citizens must know that the countries they are assisting in difficult circumstances are keeping a very strong check on their public accounts; otherwise, they will no longer agree to stump up, if I may put it that way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, as I said, we must create the conditions for growth and employment. That also implies completing the European internal market, investing more in research and innovation, and in lifelong education and training. My group wants the EU approach to be promoted over the intergovernmental approach in all these areas, quite simply because it is far more effective and far more sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Van Rompuy, I call on you to ensure that reform of the Treaty, confirmed at the last European Council, be concluded as soon and as swiftly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The budget debate is only just beginning. My group will continue to call for a thorough review of European public finances in forthcoming years, with the aim of once again creating the conditions for growth and employment in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, let us scrutinise everything, let us not be afraid and, as I have already said several times, let us take two or three different examples of budgets: for example, how can we pull Europe out of its current situation with 1%, 2% or 5%? We will not succeed by reducing resources. If we want to create jobs, we need more European resources, and this does not mean that the Member States have to spend more money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not be afraid, President van Rompuy and President Barroso. Put these proposals to us and we, the Heads of State or Government, as well as Parliament, will be forced to find the right solution – but at least let us have a number of options from which to choose.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-012-000" speaker_id="1407" name="Stephen Hughes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, December’s European Council at least gave us political agreement on a permanent crisis resolution mechanism but – given the reaction of the markets after Christmas, with new fears over the solvency of Portugal, Spain, and Belgium – we have to ask whether, once again, this was a case of ‘too little too late’. The proposed European stabilisation mechanism itself raised new questions on the financial markets and the existing Financial Stability Mechanism is now regarded as insufficient. Opportunities have been missed again.</p>
      <p sl="en">In December, Parliament sent a clear signal to the Council on eurobonds but there has been no constructive response from either the Council or the Commission. What we have had ever since 2008 is repeated hesitation and internal wrangling between Member States and the institutions, and each time, a painfully extracted response – but produced too late and constituting less than what was required.</p>
      <p sl="en">The clearest illustration of the problem is the fact that, in the face of today’s economic and monetary challenges, we simply do not have the tools we need. They are inappropriate or non-existent. Our institutional decision-making processes are complex and lacking in democracy, and our economic policy strategy is divided and ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="en">The financial markets are not keeping the pressure on us just because of high debt and deficit levels, President Barroso: they are also doing so because they want compensation for the risk of lending money to a project that seems incapable of reaching maturity or fulfilling its own destiny.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is holding the eurozone together today is less the dream of the founding fathers than simply the nightmare of the alternative: total collapse of the system. The abject failure to deal with the crisis is driving the European project into political deadlock. What chance is there, right now, of a stronger and more democratic set of institutions emerging from a revised Treaty?</p>
      <p sl="en">Intelligent calls for more political integration, like that last week from the head of the German Bundesbank, really do not stand a chance. Against this background, I am shocked, President Barroso, at the frontal attack by the Commission on social Europe and the interference with national labour markets, as in the case of Ireland. The annual growth survey is indeed a frontal attack on long-established, socially and economically essential workers’ rights and on the very concept of collective bargaining.</p>
      <p sl="en">If this is validated by the European Council, it is a strategy which, in my view, is the worst imaginable in the situation we currently face. Not only will it be exposed as economic lunacy, but it will be profoundly damaging to the European project.</p>
      <p sl="en">Big ideas can fail, Mr President, and I really worry about this European project. As history tells us, people will deny the possibility of failure right up to the last moment. Let us recognise the possibility of failure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Farage is nodding. The failure to act, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, is feeding ammunition to Mr Farage and his allies. Let us act, for heaven’s sake!</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-013-000" speaker_id="97137" name="Sylvie Goulard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I would like to make two comments on the conclusions of last December’s European Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first comment involves reminding you that the crisis is having a most singular impact on the Union for one simple reason: we have been a legal community from the very beginning and, in a legal community, the law is particularly important. It is not a question of undermining compliance with the law, but when dealing with such a serious crisis – as the Annual Growth Survey that you have just published reminds us, Mr President – it is time for action, not legalism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You tell us that this revision of the Treaties is essential to reassure the markets. In the first place, if you would permit me to be slightly impertinent, it seems to me that the meetings were not particularly reassured after the conclusion of the October European Council meeting. Really do take care, therefore, when your intention is to reassure the markets. Just think what would happen if this revision were to fail.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I come from a country that has experienced the trauma of a negative referendum with no Plan B. You were there already, Mr Barroso. Sometimes we need to consider what happens when we say to the markets, ‘We need to change the Treaties, it must all be done by this date’, and then hope that it will be done. Clearly, therefore, you are choosing the simplified procedure in the hope that it will happen. If it does happen, though, you might reassure the markets, but certainly not the people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therein lies my second point: much ado about nothing . You are changing the Treaties for a point of law. You are not changing them in order to give citizens the answers they are waiting for. There are six of us rapporteurs here working on the ‘economic governance’ package that the Commission has produced without the need to change the Treaties. We agreed to work without the need to change the Treaties, but along the way, we were told, ‘We are going to change the Treaties’. It looks like we are saying to people that we can change the Treaties, that we can go that far amid all the legal red tape, but that when it really comes down to it, we are not doing it either for the 2020 strategy to be taken seriously or for them to have jobs and growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On top of all that, then, the December European Council is asking us to speed up our work. Very well, let us speed up! I would like the Council to speed up, Mr Van Rompuy. Parliament has already presented its reports. There is a very easy way to go faster: you move closer to our positions and we stop thinking of codecision as a procedure by which the Council decides and Parliament adjusts.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-014-000" speaker_id="28233" name="Rebecca Harms" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, my main memory of the last Council meeting was not reflected in your summary and, therefore, I would like to sum the meeting up in a different way. From today’s perspective, the most important thing which I remember is that during the summit of the Heads of State or Government in Brussels, the rating agency Moody’s downgraded Ireland’s credit rating.</p>
      <p sl="de">That was the point at which we all became aware of the extent of our failure to manage the crisis, which we still have to deal with today. Anyone who compares the key figures for the debt crisis from different countries can only be surprised at how successful the speculation against the euro has been. In the meantime, one country which has much greater problems than Portugal and Spain, namely the USA, remains completely untouched by the war that the speculators are waging on the euro. That is the current state of affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">A new year has started and we have new problems to contend with. We should be dealing here and now with the problem that we predicted during the meeting, in other words, that what was decided in the meeting would not be enough. I believe that we have all realised by now that many European countries are in difficulties. They have a huge burden of debt, including both private debt and an unacceptable level of public debt. Many of the Member States of the European Union will not be able to resolve their problems without help.</p>
      <p sl="de">What should our next step be? We believe that simply reducing national debt, as many countries are beginning to do, with the encouragement of the European Union and its joint resolutions, is not sufficient on its own and that these countries are being pushed to the limits of what is acceptable. A new agreement needs to be reached concerning how this can work in a genuinely acceptable way. I believe that developments like those in Hungary, for example, are sending out a warning signal about what happens when the distribution of wealth in the countries of the European Union is too unjust and the divide is too great. During the process of reducing public debt, we must pay much more attention to fairness than we have done so far.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, we believe, and I would like to make this very clear, that the banking sector must be restructured. We are not convinced that we can justify increasing the debt burden even further in order to rescue the ‘walking dead’ in this area. I would like to endorse fully what Mrs Goulard has said. We need an approach which will allow us to prepare Europeans for the future in the context of a Green New Deal and to set a new course in this crisis. I would like to emphasise once again that Europe is a wonderful place to live and we have a lot to do to ensure that it remains that way.</p>

    <intervention id="3-015-000" speaker_id="4542" name="Timothy Kirkhope" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Council took important decisions about the future management of crises, but I agree with President Barroso that the underlying problems remain: the need to return to fiscal discipline and the reluctance by some Member States to pursue seriously economic reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">We were told that in a single currency, Member States would no longer be able to devalue their way out of trouble, and would instead have to reform their economies to make them more competitive. Whilst a superficially attractive proposition, many of us were right not to be taken in as this has proved a false prospectus. Some Member States were able to find other solutions to prop up their economies artificially: through asset-price inflation, in part, caused by an unsuitably low interest rate and a refusal to take corrective action by other means; or by injecting borrowed public funds on an unsustainable scale and, in some cases, to cover up the size of the resulting fiscal deficit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst, of course, we must find solutions to deal with the immediate consequences of these policies, and fiscal retrenchment is essential, we must equally importantly commit ourselves to economic reform: to extend labour market flexibility to create jobs, to open markets and remove barriers to trade, and to stimulate private investment so that we can fill the void left by reduced public sector spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">The financial and economic crisis made large-scale government intervention in the economy unavoidable – but we must not confuse the palliative with the cure. The long-term solution does not lie in bigger government. It lies in economic growth being generated by successful businesses and entrepreneurs, operating in competitive markets, which are able to deliver value to the consumer and create jobs for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Europe 2020 strategy, the Single Market Act, and the Innovation Union, for example, are so essential and must be given the attention they merit. The stakes are high. Whilst we have been dealing with this immediate crisis, other countries around the world – some with political values that seem very different to our own – have been forging ahead. If we do not come out of this crisis on a progressive path to reform, we will be condemned to inexorable relative decline with the most profound consequences for the promotion of our values and, indeed, for the future of the planet.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the permanent Financial Stability Mechanism in practice is nothing more than another tool to cushion major European banks from the consequences of their reckless speculation on the financial markets. It is a mechanism to make working class people throughout Europe pay for the crisis of a broken financial system and a crisis-ridden European capitalism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, tell me this morning – because you have not done so yet – about the morality of transferring tens of billions of euro of private bad debts by speculators and bankers gambled wildly on the Irish property market and placing those debts on the shoulders of the Irish people who carry no responsibility whatsoever for them. Far from being a bail-out, your IMF-EU intervention in Ireland is a mechanism to make the Irish taxpayers vassals to the European banks. You are destroying our services and the living standards of our people. You claim to be democrats, but you enslave the working people of Europe to the markets, the financial markets, which lead you around by the nose.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your Financial Stability Mechanism is a vicious weapon dictated by the markets, masquerading as something benign. We, on the left in Ireland, will insist that it goes to a referendum of the Irish people before it is passed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, what is the most commonly used word in association with the euro? No, it is not ‘failure’ – although it could be. It is ‘stability’, is it not? A decade ago, everybody said that once we had the euro currency, it would bring us stability. Well, a decade on, I would suggest that what it has brought is chaos, discord and misery for millions, and yet the word ‘stability’ is still being used this morning. Mr Barroso used it, Mr Van Rompuy used it: ‘stability’.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in Portugal went well last week, whereas the reality is that the European Central Bank was actually using taxpayers’ money to buy their own debt. Your reassurances that all is well do not work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Van Rompuy? Bond yields in Portugal rose to nearly 7% yesterday. The public right across the Union no longer supports the currency, and the battle for Spain has not even begun. The model itself is failing and yet what you want is to double the size of the bail-out fund. You even want to increase the scope of the bail-out fund so that, along with the ECB, you, too, can go on buying yet more of your own debt.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are using the crisis as a massive power grab to take us towards fiscal union. If you succeed, then we should change the name: get rid of ‘European Union’ and call it the ‘Debt Union’. If you do succeed, you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison, in which people’s suffering will be untold, while the northern countries will find themselves paying, forever, a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies. We have reached a point where it actually does not matter what any of you say. Nobody believes you. The public does not support you. I hope and pray the markets break you.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from all the fine and empty words of Mr Barroso, I have only, for the most part, been able to make out one real point, namely, that it is the job of the rich Member States to pay for the poor Member States, because that is the reality of the matter. It appears that this situation will continue for quite some time. We have to help other countries, we keep hearing, but no one has mentioned how we are actually supposed to do that. The long and short of this, basically, is that Dutch citizens are having to get their wallets out and foot the bill for the weak Member States, some of which joined the euro by fraudulent means.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Barroso says: ‘Choose sustainable growth’. All those empty words, but he has not said how we are supposed to do this. What if it does not work? Why do we not develop a scenario which will enable countries like Greece to reintroduce their own currency? It seems that that is not possible and that you are not prepared to develop scenarios of this kind, although many economists believe that they could, in fact, work very well and that they might well be our best option.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moving then to creating the conditions for growth and employment. How should we go about that? The general message that I hear is that this should be done by reducing public spending and that is exactly what we in the Netherlands have been doing. And so what does the European Union do? Rewards the Netherlands by spending even more. Do you remember asking for a 6% budget increase for the EU? Obviously, it was mainly Dutch citizens who were supposed to foot that bill, so you lack a great deal of credibility on that score, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In brief, my point here is: The Netherlands is paying for the poor countries with declining economic growth in the Netherlands. Dutch citizens are exposed to a risk of EUR 27 billion and that amount seems to do nothing but increase. Every year, we pay EUR 4.5 billion net to the EU, most of which is channelled through to the weak Member States, the EU’s spending is on the rise, while we are having to make cuts and while the value of the euro is continuing to slide, as a result of which the cost to Dutch citizens is rising, too. Mr President, the EU cannot be trusted.</p>

What we should be doing, what Mr Van Rompuy should be doing in order to give real leadership, is to be introducing a plan B and to allow these countries to go back to their own currency, to have competitive devaluations and to have a chance, because what we are doing with this policy is killing them off.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, anyone who reads the newspapers today will find out two things: that we are at a crucial point in the sovereign debt crisis, and that the European response is a succession of isolated provisions with no internal consistency.</p>
      <p sl="es">Even now, we have on the table the European Semester, the economic governance package, the provisional and permanent rescue strategy, the so-called ‘Eurobonds’ to cover part of the sovereign debt that is considered to be secure, plus an action plan based on the European Investment Bank and bonds for specific projects, which is in the proposal that the Commission sent us on the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first thing that the rapporteurs are trying to do is to combine all of this and create a complete design, a final picture to be shown to the public. Secondly, this design needs to be a European design that does not divide Europe in two – let us not stumble into a two-speed Europe – and that pursues two objectives with equal intensity: budgetary discipline – as much as is necessary – and economic growth to bring us out of the crisis that we are in.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have one comment regarding the rescue mechanism to which the President-in-Office of the Council was referring. In his first statement, he said that private investors would participate in the rescue plans, which caused shock and led to a protest by the President of the European Central Bank. It was explained, as Mr Van Rompuy did just now, that firstly, it would be case-by-case – who decides and based on what criteria? – and secondly, that it would be done according to the criteria and policies of the International Monetary Fund. The only case in which the International Monetary Fund has used this type of rescue plan was in Argentina in 2003; it plunged the country into chaos, from which it has still not emerged, and the private bondholders have still not been paid.</p>
      <p sl="es">Regarding Eurobonds, many issues have been set out here today. I would just like to add two more. It would create a market as liquid as that in the United States, and would give a boost to the euro as a reserve currency, enabling the central banks and sovereign funds to invest their reserves here.</p>
      <p sl="es">My final comment is that this needs to be complemented by the European Investment Bank and the specific bonds to respond to growth.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, you agreed to chair what is referred to as a Panel of Eminent Persons. It was made up of finance ministers who were threatened with a downgrading of their sovereign debt. Were they capable of providing a panel of eminent persons? The discord that pervades the current debate between Mr Trichet, President Barroso and Chancellor Merkel, just like the turbulence in the markets. tells us that this was not a panel of eminent persons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have been asked to manage the euro crisis. We need to manage the euro for the benefit of European citizens and not speculators. For this to happen, you have agreed to a revision of the Treaty for reasons of convenience, even though our Conference of Presidents had said how unnecessary this revision was – words confirmed by the President of the Euro Group.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, you risk enticing us down a path that could lead us along the route of ‘too little, too late’. Indeed, the day will come when you will need the wisdom of this Parliament, of a convention in order to revise the Treaty, so that we might, in future, have tax harmonisation, a European treasury, loans for mutual debt management and for restoring employment to the heart of our economic policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If you do not want the Treaty to be revised, take the bull by the horns and introduce stronger cooperation for the euro area in order to manage the problems and the responsibilities of the Member States of that zone, rather than letting it float as and where the markets take it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, because this is a matter of such importance to the European economy as a whole, even though (thankfully) my country is not part of the eurozone, I welcome at least some of the measures that were agreed at the eurozone Council, and notably the fact that eurozone countries themselves should be responsible for sorting out their own problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome the somewhat belated recognition from the Council that Article 122 of the Treaty is completely inappropriate for supporting the bail-out mechanism. These are not natural disasters and they were not beyond the control of the Member States concerned. However, in preparing the basis for that mechanism to come into force, perhaps in 2013, we should not forget the fact that we remain very much in crisis now.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation is still very dire in a number of Member States: Portugal will almost certainly face difficulties, possibly Spain and possibly Belgium. But what is particularly of concern to me is the effect on natural democracy in these countries. These countries are, in effect, becoming economic protectorates led by Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy and others. The decisions made by national electorates in these countries with regard to the spending priorities they adopt and the economic policies they pursue now have very little effect. They are under the control of Brussels and they are under the control of the international financial institutions.</p>

It is reasonable for Europe to issue European public debt, although Mrs Merkel does not approve. It is reasonable for us in Europe to be able to mutualise part of our sovereign debt, although Mrs Merkel does not approve. However, what is improper is the news that has become public that the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund could end up mutualising part of the sovereign debt accumulated by private banks at 6% or 7% interest, in Portugal’s case, after the same banks have financed themselves at 1% interest with the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr Van Rompuy, my question is as follows: how long is Europe going to be expected to be the miracle worker of financial capital? How much longer are we going to go on transforming private debt into public debt?

Whatever internal discussions take place, whether the financial facility will need to double its capital and the right to buy bonds, whether the Financial Stability Mechanism after 2013 will include trimming or will be ordered to sell eurobonds, are ideas that are not excluded by any Member State.

Even the design of the Estonian euro coin was already agreed by popular vote six years ago.

      <p sl="fr">The first thought concerns the scope of the permanent crisis management mechanism. The non-Member States of the euro area are, in fact, divided into two categories: the United Kingdom and Sweden, which are not obliged to adopt the euro, and the other states which, together with the members, represent 25 states. I would suggest that these states which use the euro should benefit from special treatment in the mechanism, something for which there is no current provision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the national parliaments. The national parliaments are not involved in the simplified procedure, unless it be in the ratification procedures. I propose that the national parliaments be included in the consultation process, on a voluntary basis, since the question arises as to who will provide political control of the future mechanism. Will it be the European Parliament or the national parliaments? As, however, there is no parliamentary dimension to the euro area, we do not know how we are going to provide political control of this mechanism. This is a question that I put to you.</p>

      <p sl="it">The institutional one is that Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that monetary policy for the countries whose currency is the euro is the exclusive competence of the Union, but Article 2 provides that exclusive competence may be exercised by the Member States if authorised by the Union. It is difficult to understand why the application of a rule clearly set out in the Treaty should require reform of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there is also a political problem: choosing the Treaty reform option, rather than using Article 2 or Articles 352 plus 136, places the European Stability Mechanism, and hence the future of the euro, at the mercy of 27 ratification processes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, this debate has shown the complexity of the crisis and the complexity of the answers. One thing I want to say to you – and it is clearly a huge majority that shares European ideals and need to have a European response – is that we should not be divided by some differences that are not the most important ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">As some of you said, there is indeed a real challenge – sometimes a threat – to European integration today. We have seen that threat in this debate today. I have heard some comments, nationalistic comments, prejudiced comments that, frankly speaking, I am not used to hearing in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">They were a minority, but those comments were made, trying to deepen divisions between Europeans, so-called rich and so-called poor Europeans. And to those who made those comments – and I am amazed by those comments – against European solidarity, trying to deepen the cleavages between the rich and poor, I say: where were you when Europe was financing your farmers after the war to feed your own people? Where were you when Europe was financing your infrastructures for the development and competitiveness of your countries? Where were you when Europe provided the internal market for selling your services and your products? Where were you when Europe was the basis for the prosperity and growth of your countries after the war?</p>
      <p sl="en">Only selfish, short-sighted, short-term views can sustain these kinds of statements against European unity. I think this is a serious problem and several of you have highlighted it. My appeal to all those who share the European ideal is that we should be united in trying to have a comprehensive response in a matter that, being serious, we have to admit requires building a consensus. Sometimes that is not easy in a European Union with 27 Member States, with the euro area now with 17 Member States – and I very much welcome Estonia as a new member – and with a process of decision making that is not always the simplest one, in part, because we are based on the principle of democracy. We have not only the European institutions; we have 27 democracies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The task we have in front of us is extremely difficult. That is why I want to appeal to all those who share the European ideal to not let us be distracted by what can be some differences of policy orientation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Hughes, I very much respect your concern with social Europe, but let us be completely open about this. What is the best way to support governments like the Greek Government, the Spanish Government, the Portuguese Government, that are led by very distinguished members of our political family. Is it to support the reforms they are taking courageously, or to say simply that those reforms are against European values?</p>
      <p sl="en">We need structural reforms in Europe, including in the labour sector. This is the reality. If you ask Prime Minister Papandreou, Prime Minister Zapatero, Prime Minister Sócrates, this is exactly what they are doing or they are planning to go even deeper in those reforms. I believe the best way to support the courageous efforts that all of us are trying to make in Europe at different paces is to have the language of truth.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current world of competition, with the pressure of some stronger emerging economies now, either we adapt or we will be putting at risk our social market economy. We need it. We will do it, I believe, without calling into question workers’ rights. I want once again – I am going to respond to you in a minute, I have not forgotten your question – I believe it is extremely important that we respect the principles of social dialogue. I said it yesterday, I reaffirm it today. But, in fact, if you do not make this kind of fiscal consolidation and social reform, we will not have confidence, and without confidence, we will not have growth, and without growth, we will not be able to provide employment to our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">To the distinguished Member of this Parliament who comes from Ireland and asked a question suggesting that the problems of Ireland were created by Europe, let me say: the problems of Ireland were created by irresponsible financial behaviour by some Irish institutions and by the lack of supervision in the Irish market. Europe is now part of the solution, it is trying to support Ireland. But it was not Europe that created this irresponsible fiscal situation and this irresponsible financial behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe is trying to support Ireland because it is important to know where the responsibility lies. This is why it is important to those of us – and this is clearly the majority – that believe in European ideals that we are able to have as much as possible a common response.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another point which was made by some of you was: what is the level of ambition? Once again, let me make clear the position of the Commission. We are for the most ambitious position in terms of integrated response. That is why the Commission will be ready to support some of the measures that some of you have proposed. But we are living a situation where we believe, in times of crisis like this, in times of market instability, that it is critically important that we make a contribution to a consensus regarding Member States and there were, in fact, some divisions on the way to address this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Revision of the Treaty: you know what was the position of the Commission. We said from the beginning that we thought it was possible to make a permanent mechanism without a revision of the Treaty. But at least one Member State of the European Union – you need unanimity for those matters – stated clearly that a revision of the Treaty was needed. Since we believe it is important to have a permanent stability mechanism, the Commission played a constructive role supporting this limited revision of the Treaty. So I think it would be a complete mistake now to be divided on this matter; since we want to reinforce stability, I think it is important that we agree on this limited revision of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of us would like to go further. I personally would like to go further in terms of the structuring and the deepening of the Community approach. But we have to be responsible at this very specific moment we are living through and to try to have the most ambitious highest common denominator and not the lowest common denominator. That is why I want to state again that some of the proposals which were put forward are indeed themselves interesting ones, but they are not able at this moment to generate the necessary consensus, and the Commission has to be very attentive to the contribution it gives to forging this consensus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I think everybody has to make a contribution. I do not like those divisions about rich and poor or new and old or centre and periphery. In Europe, all the states have exactly the same dignity and those ideas of discriminating between Member States are, in fact, very dangerous ideas for the European project. So how should we do it? We should ask all Member States that are in a more vulnerable position to do whatever they have to do to restore confidence in their economies through appropriate macro-economic stability, fiscal consolidation, structural reforms; this is critically important at this moment. We are not helping them if we are suggesting that they can escape that route; that is not helping them.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, those countries that are now in a better position should show solidarity with those countries as well. I think it is critically important that we have a strong response regarding stability of the euro area; that we are not, as happened sometimes in the past, behind the curve but ahead of the curve; that we give a comprehensive response which restores confidence in the determination of the euro area and the European Union as a whole, and not just by statements but by acting. That is an important thing, that is a question of credibility. Statements are important but that is not enough; it is important to act and for all of us as a whole to commit to stronger governance in the euro area and in the European Union. This is indeed something that markets are asking of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a problem of perception as to how we can take decisions and how we can implement those decisions. So we need stronger governance in the euro area; we need stronger economic policy coordination in the European Union as a whole and basically, we should, all of us, commit to the principles of solidarity and responsibility. It is not just a question of responsibility; it is question of solidarity. It is not just a question of solidarity; it is also a question of responsibility. Only then can we achieve stability, and stability is the basis for our future prosperity.</p>

    <intervention id="3-037-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Herman Van Rompuy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Council">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I will begin with a few positive facts. I apologise for appearing positive every now and then.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, economic growth is much stronger now than we thought it was a few weeks or months ago. Unemployment is falling in some countries. Who would have believed that in 2008 or in 2009? As far as the European Union in general is concerned, overall, from 2010-2011, employment will increase again after the biggest crisis for 70 years. I will say it again: we did not expect that a few months ago – and yet it is happening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, of course there is a crisis, but our common currency – the common currency of 27 countries, at any rate – is stable, insofar as its exchange rate against the US dollar is now 1.30. Once upon a time, it was 0.85. At that time, no one said that the euro was at risk. Compared with other continents and other major currencies, we have a stable balance of payments and, compared with other major countries, we have a budget deficit that is practically half of theirs. This therefore explains why, despite all our problems, the euro is a stable currency. I wanted to highlight this before moving on to other points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly, we are fully aware that we need to forge ahead, but we really must remember, as I mentioned the last time I was here, that we entered this crisis in the euro area – which is more a crisis of the euro area than of the euro – without any suitable instruments. We virtually had to make them up on the spot. That is a joint responsibility, but it also explains why we did not go as quickly as we might have thought at the beginning, or also as quickly as circumstances required.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We had nothing, though. There was a Stability and Growth Pact which was not observed. There was no macro-economic oversight. There was no crisis mechanism, either temporary or stable, and there were no strong institutions to provide financial supervision. We had to come up with everything on the spot, in mid-crisis, and that is a joint responsibility. Some of you have said, ‘It is too little, too late’. Well, the fact that we had few or no instruments explains why we are not in the ‘too little, too late’ situation, but in the ‘step by step’ situation. It is a worthy explanation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A second point I would like to make is that some of you have said, ‘Yes, but the crisis is not under control. Look at developments on the markets’. At the same time, and in the same breath, others – sometimes exactly the same people – are saying, ‘You cannot let the markets dictate how you act’. It is one argument or the other, but it is not always very coherent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the measures taken, naturally, there are reforms to be embarked upon in the Member States, not only those that are facing problems, but in all the Member States: reforms to free up employment potential and to free up growth potential. Clearly, reforms are often painful. Clearly, there is a colossal job to be done to spread what is to be asked of people in a fair way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would remind you, however, that some major countries that are now coming out of the economic crisis more quickly took measures four, five, even six years ago, very tough measures at home which, at that time, met very stiff resistance on the social side. They were effective in terms of growth and an increase in employment, though. We have to go through difficult times, but we need to work harder for the load to be spread fairly. Our Union can hold up meaningful examples to show that this is the right approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Reforms are necessary at Member State level, and reforms are, of course, necessary at the level of the Union itself and of the euro area in particular. That is why it is very important to set up as quickly as possible the economic governance that was decided in the Task Force, which was debated on the basis of six proposals from the Commission to Parliament, and for all those involved in codecision to reach agreement. This is extremely urgent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It must be done if we are to go further still in the convergence of economic growth and in economic policy within the framework of the euro area. If we can achieve it through agreements between the euro area countries, we need not only to think about it but to work towards it to reach a conclusion in the next few weeks and in the next few months. Perhaps, however, we need to go further within the euro area than was decided in the Task Force involved in the Commission’s proposals because in fact, when there is a common currency, there is greater need of a common economic policy and of parallel economic development between all the members of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Has structural economic growth been forgotten? No! That is why, right in the middle of the crisis, in March, we decided on the Europe 2020 strategy. That is why, in a few days, at the February Council, we will be debating the innovation and energy policy. Amid all the problems that the crisis is forcing us to deal with, we must not overlook the longer-term prospects, the structural prospects for growth and employment. Furthermore, in the very short term, we are preparing for a global approach to improving the instruments created in 2010 to overcome the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is an agenda – a clear agenda. Can we go faster? Yes! As I said, there were two obstacles. The first stemmed from the fact that we had to make everything up on the spot and the second relates to the need – because we live in a democracy – for consensus among our 27 Member States, our 27 democracies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, those who support the European project are very much in the majority in Parliament. Let us not fall into trying to outdo each other to find out who is the most European. I believe that the gap is growing wider between those who support the European project and those who do not, but in spite of all our problems, the important thing is to hold our course, to maintain our direction and stay focused. That is far more important than progress made separately. The common will to work towards the same direction in terms of the European project is what counts, as was repeatedly said at the December European Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will get there by this gradual, progressive approach. I am convinced that we are heading in the right direction. I am convinced that there is a common will. I am convinced that we will make it in the end.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The European Council is going to establish a permanent emergency fund for the euro area. That may be necessary if we are to regain financial markets’ confidence in the government bonds issued by the weak countries of the euro. However, this also begs questions about the foundations of our economic and monetary union. Those who have been tasked with establishing this fund do not appear to feel confident that Member States are budgeting prudently or that they are adhering to the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. I would have liked the European Council to have said more about the significant disparities within the euro area, including the different competitive positions of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Would it appear that the diversity within the monetary union is too great to enable a uniform interest rate? Or are there adequate solutions to the differences in the competitive position, budget and social and economic structure of various Member States?</p>
      <p sl="nl">To this end, any additional guarantees for the temporary emergency fund should be accompanied by concrete commitments and progress in cuts and structural reforms from the weak countries of the euro area. I wish the Member States within the Council the wisdom they need to determine this matter! Our objectives should be compliance with the agreements and ensuring that we do not allow things to go too far again. Therefore, both Member States and the European Commission have a great responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The nature and objectives of the process of European capitalist integration are becoming ever more evident as the effects of the crisis of capitalism in the EU are deepening, which is exacerbating the economic and social situation in several Member States, exacerbating imbalances. The last European Council showed this clearly once again. Not one word was uttered on the social situation in the EU, on unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, which have increased throughout 2010, declared the Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Not one word was uttered on the causes of all of this. Not a word was spoken about taxation of financial transactions or about an end to tax havens. Changes are now being proposed for the Treaty that was once intended to last for a generation, with a simplified process, as demanded by the powers that be in the EU, in order to create a mechanism that they believe to be ‘fully consistent with [International Monetary Fund] policies’. In future, they want to further tighten the straitjacket on countries such as Portugal, making them the target of demeaning pressure, blackmail and threats relating to financial capital, with the active complicity of the EU. All this is happening alongside the deepening of antisocial and anti-democratic measures associated with so-called economic governance and the requested ‘structural reforms’.</p>

      <p sl="el">In his recent book, the former Prime Minister of England, Mr Gordon Brown, says that, as a result of delays on the part of the EU in passing decisions on the economic crisis in Greece, the amount that Greece needed to borrow rose by 90 billion. Germany’s filibustering in terms of speeding up the procedure to increase and restructure the borrowing fund is having an economic knock-on effect on Greece and Ireland. I ask the Commission: how can the members of the Union damaged by late decisions on the part of the Council be compensated? Will the Commission support Greece in an effort to establish why its debt has increased since the Greek crisis was announced?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">A different country now holds the rotating Presidency. Hungary is occupying the Presidency for the first time in its history, which is always an important event in the European Union. During the Belgian Presidency, we developed new ways of cooperating with the Presidency and the Council, with meetings at administrative, Commission, ministerial and presidential level, or, in other words, between the Presidency and the President of the European Parliament. We will continue these forms of cooperation during the Hungarian Presidency too, as I have already established with the Prime Minister, Mr Orbán. Today, we will discuss the programme of activities of the Hungarian Presidency. I would like to welcome the Prime Minister, Mr Orbán, to the European Parliament.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I am pleased to see that the sittings of the European Parliament are no less animated and rich in performances than those of the Hungarian Parliament, which makes me feel quite at home.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much for the invitation. I extend my respectful greetings to the Members of Parliament, and to President Barroso, as well as the President of the European Parliament, my dear old friend.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to state that it is an honour for me to be speaking here today as the President-in-Office of the Council. For you, of course, this is a six-monthly routine. Every six months, you see a prime minister standing here, presenting the programme for their Presidency. From our point of view, the Hungarians’ point of view, however, this is far more significant than a six-monthly routine. For us, the fact that we can stand here today is an act of historic justice. I would like to remind you that it was Hungary who gave the most human lives and blood for freedom and democracy after World War II, both during the revolution of 1956 and during the subsequent retribution. We were the ones who struck the first blow against the communist regime, who took up arms against the Soviet empire and proved to the world that communist doctrine is not a harmless ideology, but a dangerous threat to western civilisation. We dislodged the first brick in the wall of communism and, through the crack we had opened, the draught swept out the entire communist system.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, for this reason, I feel that we Hungarians can rightly claim that we have contributed a great deal to Europe becoming unified once again. For Hungarians, it is therefore a historic justice of sorts that the Prime Minister of Hungary may speak here today as the President-in-Office of the Council. I would like to assure you that we are following in the footsteps of the revolutionaries of 1956 and intend to serve the cause of European unity through their ideals and faith.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, we in Central Europe, including us Hungarians, have always been interested in a unified Europe, and remain so to this day. However, creating and maintaining European unity needs strength too. Twenty years ago, Europe could muster the strength to overcome dividedness and become unified. It had realised that this was an historic moment it had to seize in order to reunite Europe. This strength is recalled in the motto of the Hungarian Presidency: ‘Strong Europe’.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, today we are facing a challenge of similar proportions to that of twenty years ago, and thus it is perhaps no overstatement to pronounce that the European Union is facing its most challenging period of the past twenty years. Today, we must overcome the storms of a global crisis and find Europe’s place in a global economy that is undergoing complete transformation and rearrangement. I am of the opinion that, in order to be able to stand its ground, Europe must remain unified, and even today, unity needs strength. I am convinced that all Member States of the European Union, including my home country, can only become strong and successful if the European Union itself is strong. If it is strong, it can respond to the challenges of global competitiveness, as well as demographic, environmental, climate and security challenges. The only question is from where Europe can draw such strength. This question will be answered if we ask ourselves another question, namely, what is weakening Europe today? What is impeding the competitiveness of our entire civilisation today? Obviously, it is not other continents threatening us, and it is not a foreign ideology either. Quite the contrary; our true problem is a very practical one. The English language has a very short, simple word to describe it, and that word is debt. Today, the strength of Europe is being marred and eroded by a monumental amount of debt. In the new competition of the post-crisis world, debt will be the greatest impediment and the greatest risk to the western world, including to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency is convinced that there is only one way debt can be combated, and that is called work. We Hungarians are all too aware of this, as the ailments of the Hungarian economy have been caused by the very fact that we have the lowest employment rate throughout Europe, in all the European Union. I am ashamed even to say it out loud, but it is only 55%. And where there is no work, where there are no jobs, there is no money either, and from that follows debt and loans. Well, ladies and gentlemen, our true resource for the future lies in the traditional European mentality, which values work. It was the European mentality of valuing work that has made our civilisation successful. We have a European code of conduct, one of the cornerstones of which has, for centuries, been the principle of prudent economics, meaning that we must not spend more than we are able to produce. Another fundamental European value is that we must not pass on our debts to our children and grandchildren. I am convinced that respect for work includes the idea and the mentality that we can only acquire something if we work for it first. If we can get everything in advance that we could otherwise only have obtained as the fruits of years of work, the very meaning of our work is called into question, and that meaning is increasingly transformed to mean the repayment of our ever-accumulating debt, and changing our whole attitude to work. This is the crisis we are all facing.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, everyone agrees on the diagnosis of debt. To us, debating European politicians, it is like a disease. Everyone agrees on the diagnosis, but there is vast debate regarding the cure. The disease, however, is a dangerous one, and our time is short. It is my opinion, therefore, that we do not have much time for debate, especially not on whether we should automatically reject certain cures that seem unusual or new for the very reason of their being unusual or new. We need courage and open-mindedness for the governments and parliaments of the individual nation states to be able to overcome their debt crises. However, I am convinced that this is exactly what the citizens of Europe expect us to do. They expect jobs, growth and security, and therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the focus of the Hungarian Presidency, the exact point-by-point transcript of which you will also find in this small book, the focus of this Hungarian Presidency will be on economic issues, and at the top of the priority list of the Hungarian Presidency are the very issues related to the economic and debt crisis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency believes that the direction set out by the Council, that is, the direction of crisis management, is the right way, but further efforts will be required, and we are therefore convinced that the Treaty will need to be amended and that a legal basis must be created for the current temporary crisis management mechanism to be replaced by a permanent stability mechanism from 2013. The Hungarian Presidency will do everything in its power to this end. Furthermore, at the core of the Hungarian Presidency’s thinking are the strengthening of economic policy coordination, the facilitation of economic growth and the promotion of sustainable economic growth for job creation. It is therefore a special goal for our Presidency, and in this I would also like to ask for your cooperation, to create six laws that will facilitate the achievement of this goal, that is, economic policy coordination. I would like to ask for your committed cooperation in this regard. The Hungarian Presidency will be a Parliament-friendly Presidency, and so I ask you to do everything to ensure that these six laws can be adopted as soon as possible in cooperation with us.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Hungarian Presidency is convinced that the structural reforms of the Member States must be implemented in a more consistent manner and must be coordinated to a greater extent than before. The European Semester has begun and this is something new for everyone; not just for us Hungarians, but for you as well, as it is a completely new programme of the European Union. The Semester has begun with the Commission’s annual macro-economic growth report, and I would like to congratulate Mr Barroso on this excellent document, which is suitable for taking the first step, and which lays out the directions and issues that will serve as the basis for the debates that will be conducted in the various Council configurations during our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, national credibility is, of course, also required when one intends to propose a common economic policy for Europe. I would like to inform you that there is a good chance that my home country, which has been on the wall of shame of the European Union for a long time due to the excessive deficit procedure initiated against it, now has a realistic chance of getting out of this situation. In 2011, Hungary’s budget deficit will be below 3% and we will be one of the two EU Member States whose national debt will decrease in 2011. This will be crucial for the credibility of our Presidency programme.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency considers it especially important that we strengthen the single market. We believe that the strengthening of the single market is one of the potential sources of economic growth. Our intention is to remove existing barriers, implement deregulation and extend the single market to new areas, such as digitalisation. We support the favourable business environment that is to be created for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Among the priority topics of the Hungarian Presidency are energy policy and innovation, which we will be discussing on 4 February at a joint summit. I would like to inform you that Hungary is of the opinion that it is crucial for us to remove any existing regulatory barriers in the field of energy policy and to establish the missing infrastructural links in order to create a real and interoperable energy market in Europe. A similarly important objective of the Hungarian Presidency is to ensure that Europe possesses diversified supply lines in the field of energy. European energy policy is standing before a breakthrough; the Member States have signed the agreements – I will be signing the Slovak–Hungarian agreement with the Slovak Prime Minister next week – that will enable the first north-south gas distribution network, ranging from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic and through Romania to the Black Sea, to commence operation, thereby creating a complete interconnector. Since, for the last 40 years, we have been thinking in terms of east and west, a north-south connection has been missing, and this is where I consider the treaties to be signed a breakthrough.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the Roma strategy is a priority aspect of the Hungarian Presidency, because there is no point in a smart Europe if it has no heart. Europe, however, will only have a heart if it creates opportunities for social inclusion for the most disadvantaged social groups. This is not the time to discuss the Roma strategy, and I would therefore only like to point out, as the leader of a country concerned on this issue, that we are all playing with fire, and if we do not manage to establish a Roma strategy at European level, the Roma communities that are already settled and, to a certain degree, already integrated, will once again choose a nomadic lifestyle within Europe, and the problem will thus be transmitted from the countries involved today to others as well. This provides the grounds for presenting a European strategic answer to the Roma issue, which otherwise falls under national competence, and I would personally be very proud if we could jointly manage to adopt a common European Roma strategy by the end of the Hungarian Presidency in June.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I must also touch upon the matter of enlargement, even though I, too, am aware that understandably, there is a fear of enlargement in Europe. We are barely able to overcome our own internal problems, and under such circumstances, coming up with newer and newer ideas for enlargement is extremely risky. Nevertheless, the Hungarian Presidency would welcome the return of an optimistic approach to enlargement in Europe. We would welcome it if the European Union found that we have unfinished business before us, as not all European nations that could be integrated into the European Community are currently part of the European Union. Furthermore, I personally find it unfair that a country like Croatia, for example, which has shown better performance over the past years than Hungary, a Member State of the EU, is still left outside and is not allowed to join the circle of Member States. The Hungarian Presidency would therefore like to see Croatia’s accession negotiations through to the signing of the treaty, the period of conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am aware that the extension of the Schengen area is a controversial issue. The countries concerned here are Romania and Bulgaria, but as someone who knows this region well and also lives in a country bordering it, I know with certainty that these countries are ready, and although I know that the Hungarian Presidency must expect debates, I will always stand up, I will personally always stand up for Bulgaria and Romania being included in the Schengen area as soon as possible, that is, without delay.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the programmes of the Hungarian Presidency also include the Danube strategy, as well as the belief that the European Union must continue to take a leading role in the global fight against climate change, and for this reason, we would welcome it if the results of the December 2010 Cancún Summit could enter into the implementation phase, and we could continue with the negotiations to ensure that legally binding decisions are adopted by the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, since my time spent talking is beginning to border on impoliteness, I will mention only briefly that the topics of the Hungarian Presidency also include the discussion of family policy and the demographic situation, and I would be pleased if Hungary could, without provoking interinstitutional debates, contribute to the European Union forming a clear and firm position on the freedom of religion and taking action against the persecution of Christians, which is an important issue for the coming six months.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, finally, I would like to point out that I am aware that all of us sitting or standing in this House are politicians. We all have our own points of view, our own principles, our own comrades, and also our own interests. While acknowledging this, I respectfully advise you, whatever opinion you may have about Hungarian internal politics, not to associate your criticisms and actions related to Hungarian domestic politics with the following six months of the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union. If you do associate them, I will, of course, be ready for a fight, but if you do so, it will not be Hungary’s loss, but above all, a loss for the entire community of the European Union. I therefore ask you, for the sake of the European Union and the difficult tasks that lie before us, to make this distinction whenever possible. The last debate was also pulled back to the grounds of reason and rational discourse by Hungary when I agreed with President Barroso that we would welcome EU investigations relating to the criticised media law, that we would engage in ongoing discussions about its observations, and that if any faults could be found and verified, we would, of course, be willing to amend the law. For us, these issues are not a matter of prestige, and are not about flexing our muscles or vanity. On a side note, if anyone wishes to fight for the freedom of the press in Europe, they can always rely on the Hungarian Government, which has had its share of anti-communist struggles.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware that an extremely difficult six months lie before Europe, but I am optimistic and believe that Europe is up to the task. After World War II, Europe managed to build cooperation between the peoples of Europe amidst hatred and ruins. In 1989 and 1990, it managed to reunite Europe, and so I have reason to assume that it will also be capable of responding to the similar historic challenge we are facing now. This means that we will need more, during and after the Hungarian Presidency, than ambitious administration. We must look further than the files massing on our desks, and we must look to an even farther horizon than that of issues which can be solved within six months or one or two years. The Hungarian Presidency is convinced that a community can only be bound together by shared goals and shared values. Shared goals can only be based on shared values. The Hungarian Presidency will carry out its day-to-day work in the spirit of this great, far-reaching European goal, will accord due respect to all of us, and will show the utmost humility to the cause. Thank you for honouring me with your attention.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Prime Minister, thank you for your speech and presentation of the programme of activities of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-049-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the start of 2011 is an historic moment for Hungary as it takes over the helm of the Council of the European Union for the first time, but it is also a critical moment for the European Union as a whole. The Hungarian Presidency comes at a time that demands a special sense of responsibility regarding the tasks ahead for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is particularly appropriate that the Hungarian Presidency has chosen as its motto ‘strong Europe’. Europe is at its strongest and most effective when we are united, when we act in a coordinated manner with strong institutions, when we show a common resolve to steer a course through these stormy waters, and when we show that, by working together, we are capable of finding solutions to the most pressing problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is important to remember because we are not out of the woods yet. There can be no backtracking and no return to business as usual. We must implement our reforms without delay and develop the innovative policies needed to make the Europe 2020 vision a reality. So I look forward to working in partnership with Prime Minister Orbán and with the Hungarian Presidency to make sure that it is a successful one. Let me tell Prime Minister Orbán here and now that he can count on the Commission’s full support on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, the Commission hopes very much that it can count on the support of the Hungarian Presidency. A fruitful partnership is particularly important in the areas of financial services, economic governance, the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, energy and the internal market. So I am pleased that the Presidency’s priorities fully reflect this.</p>
      <p sl="en">A strong partnership with the European Parliament is also essential, as in some cases, fast-tracking of proposals will be important. For example, we must have the new tools for reinforced economic governance at our disposal as soon as possible. A clear target has been set by the European Council to deliver by June 2011. The rhythm of work already set by the Hungarian Presidency and the comments we have just heard from the Prime Minister are encouraging in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we start this new Presidency, a comprehensive EU agenda and appropriate governance tools are already in place. The European Semester, Europe 2020 strategy and its flagship initiatives and the Single Market Act – all these key initiatives have been discussed and endorsed by the EU institutions. But, of course, we need to do more and it is now also time to act decisively to implement a comprehensive programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Semester is at the heart of the reformed economic strategy of the European Union. Its proper implementation will be a major task in the months ahead. The Commission kick-started the Semester by adopting the Annual Growth Survey last week. Following discussions in several Council formations, the process will culminate at the European Council in March, which will provide essential policy guidance for Member States, to be reflected in their stability and convergence programmes as well as their national reform programmes, both of which we are expecting in April.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since we have already discussed this in the previous debate, I will not go into detail, but, of course, the priorities are macro-economic stability, namely, fiscal consolidation, structural reform and, of course, frontloaded economic growth, employment being, of course, our most important concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">Final agreement on the European crisis management resolution mechanism will also be a key deliverable during the Hungarian Presidency. The Hungarian Presidency will also have an important role to play in shepherding through our efforts to relaunch the single market. Following the public consultation launched by the Commission on the Single Market Act, the EU institutions will be asked to agree on a definitive action plan to be realised by the end of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Energy will also be an important area in the coming months and already at the European Council meeting on 4 February. The Commission already has a series of important energy initiatives on the table which will feed into the February European Council. These include the energy agenda 2020, our communication on energy infrastructure priorities. We will soon be adopting a ‘resource-efficient Europe’ flagship initiative in which energy also features strongly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission intends to develop its work around the following five axes: a strong energy policy as a key to competitive and sustainable growth and energy security; the internal market in energy as an asset; building the European Union’s new energy infrastructure; making decisive progress on energy efficiency; and developing an effective and united new approach to external energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Support from the Presidency and the European Parliament will also be essential to ensure an agreement on the European Union Patent. As requested by several Member States, the Commission adopted a proposal for enhanced cooperation in this field on 14 December. The Commission appreciates Hungary’s commitment to taking forward work on the EU patent under its Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Negotiations with Croatia are now in the final phase. Conclusion of negotiations under the Hungarian Presidency is an ambitious goal, especially considering the remaining requirements Croatia still needs to fulfil. This will require an all-out push on Croatia’s side.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency considers the social and economic integration of Roma as one of its priorities. The Commission set up a Roma taskforce to analyse the use and effectiveness of EU and national funds in all Member States for Roma inclusion. Building on this work, the Commission will present a European Union framework for national Roma integration strategies in April.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new Presidency will also put the spotlight on our Danube strategy. The Danube region has great potential that has not yet been properly exploited due to ineffective cooperation. The aim is to develop a more coordinated approach to bring European added value to this region. The Commission welcomes the Presidency’s commitment to this strategy. Hungary has already contributed significantly to its preparation, including producing policy papers and hosting a conference in Budapest which I had the pleasure of attending. It will be in charge of guiding it through the Council and launching the Danube strategy implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the debate on cohesion policy will intensify in the coming months. The Commission welcomes the intention of the Presidency to discuss the proposals set out in the fifth cohesion report. We will present legislative proposals for future cohesion policy this summer, following proposals on the next financial framework. The fifth Cohesion Forum, to take place at the end of January in Brussels, will allow for a major stakeholder discussion. It is encouraging that Prime Minister Orbán himself will participate. Effectiveness and European added value must be the driving principles of the reform. The Commission is convinced that cohesion policy needs to underpin more strongly the policy priorities and reform agenda of Europe 2020. I count on the support of the Presidency in this work. It is our common interest and responsibility to make funding more effective. Only in this way can we defend an ambitious budget for cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since I know this is a matter of political concern, let me add a final comment on Hungary’s media law. The principle of freedom of the press is a sacred one in the European Union. I stated this in Brussels and in Budapest when I had the honour to be received there by Prime Minister Orbán. The Commission has looked at the law and this week will write to the Hungarian authorities to seek clarification on certain aspects that could create legal problems and that have raised some concerns. On the basis of the Hungarian authorities’ answers, we will assess the situation further. The Prime Minister has already made it quite clear that adjustments will be made should the Commission decide after this legal assessment that changes need to be made.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister Orbán has just said he is a politician. I am sure that he is a very committed politician and I think you can agree that, leaving aside the legal issues – which will be dealt with in an objective and impartial manner because we will treat Hungary exactly like any other Member State – we must also concern ourselves with the political aspects. Hungary, like any Member State taking on the rotating Presidency, needs to have the full backing of all the other Member States and the European institutions to make the Presidency a success. I hope that Prime Minister Orbán will take this into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have no doubt that this Presidency must be a success, coming at such a critical time for the European Union. Let us allow the proper procedures to take their course and, at the same time, let us give our full support to Hungary as it takes on this heavy responsibility. During my recent visit to Hungary, I received messages from young people who said that they were proud that their country for the first time had the responsibility of leading the Council of the European Union. Let us make Hungary closer to Europe and Europe closer to Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a lot to do. The Hungarian Presidency can count on every assistance from the European Commission in pushing forward its priorities. It is only by achieving these goals together that we will build a strong Europe, a Europe which delivers growth and jobs, which preserves and reaffirms our values – namely, the sacred values of freedom and justice – and which positions our societies to thrive in a changing world.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, rarely will the Presidency of the Council of Ministers have had to face so many challenges: the challenge of the euro, which we must stabilise, the challenge of employment, which is experiencing stronger growth and therefore a more efficient economy, the challenge of energy independence and food security, while prices for raw materials are rising alarmingly. I have no doubt that the Hungarian Presidency will be able to deal with these challenges, alongside the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Orbán, you have won the confidence of your electorate in Hungary. Your party, Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége (FIDESZ), is based on an idea, on an ideal, on a value: that of liberty and democracy. Since your election, you have, with the Hungarian Parliament, undertaken a whole series of reforms which your people have called for by democratically giving you a large majority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, one of those reforms – the one concerning the media – is the subject of legal scrutiny by the European Commission, guardian of the Treaties. You yourself stated last week – and I thank you for doing so – during your talks with Mr Barroso, and since then, that were this law incompatible with European law, you would submit it to your parliament for the necessary changes. I have complete faith in your word. For my part, I, like you, have confidence in the European Commission, which plays its role as guardian of the Treaties, and I also have confidence that you will respect the letter and the spirit of the European rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister Orbán, we have known each other for a long time and I consider you a very great European. For my part, I have no reason to doubt that you will do what you have said with regard to the media law and to the other priorities faced by your Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now come to those priorities, beginning with the first: the stability of Europe. Perhaps it is a good thing that the two presidencies of the Council that will follow one another in 2011 will be assumed by countries that do not belong to the euro area but which wish to join it in the very near future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, both Hungary and Poland are both entitled to join it. They therefore have a stake in ensuring the stability of this currency. I repeat: the only effective way of ending the speculative attacks against the euro and of strengthening the fundamentals of the European economy is to restore order to our public finances. This involves stronger coordination of fiscal and social policies in our countries, as is quite rightly provided for by the new budgetary period for the European Semester. It also depends on greater flexibility in our employment market and greater productivity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Like the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) firmly believes that the future of 500 million Europeans depends on a stronger, more united and more coherent Europe. It depends on having more of a Europe and certainly not less of a Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Orbán, we need European economic governance. We need more communitarianism and I am sure that you will work towards this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President-in-Office of the Council, you have defined the setting up of a common energy policy as one of your main priorities. I think you are right. Mr Buzek, our President, has also, quite rightly, made it one of the strengths of his Presidency. I agree with you on this point, but I also want to warn you about the terribly worrying consequences that may result from the increase in the prices of all kinds of raw materials which has been particularly sharp over the last few months. We have already seen the social implications in several Mediterranean countries of such a price rise in basic foodstuffs, especially for the poorest countries. I hope that Europe will take this problem seriously and deal forcefully with speculators.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also hope that the Hungarian Presidency – I thought that the Group of the Greens were going to be silent, but I can hear them talking; it is not right, people should be quiet all the way through – will back the Commission in its assistance to Tunisia, which is going through a crucial time and must be supported as it moves towards change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Orbán, you know that to succeed in your mandate and help Europe through its current difficult phase, you need the confidence of Parliament. In December, when we were in a difficult position with regard to the Council, you had the courage to sign the first-rate letters for us which really helped Parliament to approve its budget. Thank you, already, for what you did in December!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even before January, you included the political groups when defining your priorities, and naturally chose Mrs Győri, one of our very fine former colleagues, as Minister for EU Affairs. These are all positive signs which, I have no doubt, will be accompanied by a perfect balance between the reforms you are undertaking and the European values that every one of us here defends.</p>

    <intervention id="3-051-000" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that we are currently in a serious situation. These are serious times.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, Mr Orbán, you will be familiar to many Europeans as an opponent of the Communist regime and a supporter of freedom for your country. We respect that.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was pleased that we both had the opportunity yesterday afternoon to discuss another man whom Hungarians can be proud of and that is the former prime minister and foreign minister of your country who opened the border between Hungary and Austria, together with Alois Mock, and paved the way for German unity. This man is the leader of my party, Gyula Horn. Let us pay tribute to another great Hungarian.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Orbán, in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, you acknowledged something in your answer to Mr Barroso’s question. You said that if the Hungarian media law is not compatible with European standards, you will change it. That is a good thing. However, in saying this, you have also acknowledged that this is not just an internal political debate in Hungary, but also a European debate. It is clear that this law concerns the fundamental rules and values of the European Union, which is a community based on the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to look at two elements of the media law. It will establish a media authority which is intended to supervise the balance of reporting in the media. In addition, the law will introduce an obligation on the media to take a balanced approach. You have a two-thirds majority in parliament and it is a legitimate majority. Using this two-thirds majority, you have set up a media authority which consists exclusively of members of your party, from the government or from the group of people who have close links with it. This means that a media authority with members from only one side of the political spectrum will be responsible for monitoring balanced reporting. This is not acceptable within a European community based on the rule of law.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">In a democracy, Mr Orbán, the media monitor those who are in power. The result of this law is that those in power will monitor the media. This is also unacceptable in a democracy and that is why the people of Europe are so concerned about this law.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">You have rightly pointed out that we have a lot of problems to solve. We are in the midst of a severe financial crisis and we have difficulties with the budget. Another pressing issue for the European Union involves rising food prices, in particular, in our neighbouring regions, but also within the European Union itself in the foreseeable future. This is a problem which we need to address quickly. We also need to focus on employment in the Member States. There are certainly many items in your programme which we can work on together. In that respect, you are a genuine representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>
      <p sl="de">When Mr Sarkozy, the French President, was President-in-Office of the Council, he also gave a left-leaning speech here in Parliament and then proceeded to implement right-wing policies once he was at home. I told him that he spoke like Karl Marx in exile. Everything that you have said sounds good. If you can now act in accordance with your words, that will be good enough.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I believe that we must, and indeed will, assess your achievements on the basis of the programme that you have presented here. You have referred, Mr Orbán, to the fact that you have a large majority at home. That is a good thing. We have had to deal with a number of governments, including some from your party, who have done nothing but sit here and call home to find out if they were still in office. We cannot afford that sort of thing now. From this point of view, your two-thirds majority is excellent, because it gives you plenty of time. However, it also puts you under an obligation to use your strong position to make Hungary and also the European Union stronger.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask you a question. What is the purpose of your gift of a carpet which has been laid in the Council building in Brussels and which shows Hungary with its 1848 borders? What sort of a message is this in the context of European gesture politics? As you seem intent on using symbols from the 19th century, I would like to tell you what the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, said to the German people in the 19th century. He said: ‘A great victory is a great danger. Human nature finds it harder to endure a victory than a defeat. Indeed, it almost seems to be easier to achieve a victory than to endure it in such a way that it does not turn into a serious defeat’.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that you should take into consideration that a large majority provides a great deal of support, but also imposes a major obligation. Therefore, I am talking to you in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union and not in your role as prime minister. The President-in-Office of the Council must do everything possible to dispel any doubts about the Presidency’s readiness to defend fundamental European democratic values. It would be best for you not to wait for the Commission’s investigation. Mr Barroso, I would like to point out to you that following a ban on trucks imposed by one Austrian province, the Commission suffered a severe identity crisis and then took immediate measures against Austria. However, when one of the fundamental principles of European democracy is put at risk, you sit and do nothing.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">You must make sure that we receive the results of the investigation soon, otherwise this debate will place a heavy burden on the Hungarian Presidency. We all want the Presidency to be a success and we do not want to see its progress blocked. You, Mr Orbán, can do something yourself to help the situation. Withdraw the law and introduce a new and better one. Hungary needs a balanced media law.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, let me say very clearly to Mr Orbán that my group supports the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. Mr Prime Minister, like you, we also believe in a strong euro, so we are fully backing you in your priorities for this Presidency. I think that in the six months of this Presidency, you have one top priority and that is to establish, as fast as possible, real economic governance inside the European Union and inside the eurozone. Because let us be clear: 2010 was not a good example for the euro and for the European Union. We were always running behind the facts, after the events. What we need now, as fast as possible, under your leadership and the leadership of the President of the Commission, is a global package on economic governance, a real economic and fiscal union, because it is nonsense to have a monetary union and not have an economic and fiscal union at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not asking you to invent new ideas but to take last week’s package presented by the President of the Commission and Commissioner Olli Rehn and to put this package with its four cornerstones on the table of the Council and the table of your colleagues. Mr Orbán and Mr Barroso, only one element, one cornerstone is missing in this package. Nowhere in the world is there a currency without one bond market behind it. In Europe, we still have 27 bond markets, 27 speculations and 27 spreads. In the eurozone, we still have 17 bond markets, 17 spreads and 17 speculations. What the markets are doing at present is not speculating against the euro but speculating on the differences inside the euro. The only way to tackle that is to have a genuine bond market in Europe of EUR 4 000 billion or 5 000 billion which can be compared to what exists in other parts of the world, with special treatment for the triple-A countries.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Mr Orbán I want to say something about the elephant in the room. The elephant in this beautiful room is naturally the media law in Hungary. I will not talk about the law itself; I will rather use the example of one of my favourite writers, a great Hungarian writer, Sándor Márai. With the language policy of the former Slovak Government and the current media law in Hungary, I doubt that Márai would ever have existed. Why? Well, Márai lived in Kassa, which today we know as Košice. He wrote in Hungarian which, as you know, was, until recently, a problem in Slovakia. Also importantly he was a journalist, which is becoming a problem for tomorrow because, with the new legislation, which obliges the media to provide proper information and adequate information about public life, I think Márai and his books would never have existed. The Confessions of a Citizen , his masterpiece, is quite improper and, in many respects, totally inadequate, but it is a masterpiece of literature.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, the aim of media governance is not to guarantee proper and adequate information. No, the aim of media governance is to uphold pluralism and to guarantee that any initiative in media can be developed.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I hope that you will use your majority, your two-thirds majority, which is something that all politicians dream about …</p>
      <a text="(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit: ‘No! No!’)"/>
      <p sl="de">Not you – you are an exception.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all, allow me to say one thing so that there can be no ambiguity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Group of the Greens, and I personally, love Hungary. I cried in 1954 when Hungary lost the World Cup. My first demonstration, holding on to my brother’s hand, was in 1956 against the Soviet invasion of Budapest. As Mr Verhofstadt said, many intellectuals, many Hungarian writers have supported us politically and intellectually for years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I sided with Prime Minister Orbán when he fought the Communists at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s. I sided with Prime Minister Orbán when he asked liberal Europeans to expel Jörg Haider from the European liberal party. There was a Viktor Orbán who, for me, was a politician who ought to be respected. Today, Prime Minister Orbán, you are on the way to becoming a European Chavez, a national populist who does not exactly understand the essence and structure of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am going to tell you a very simple fact, Prime Minister Orbán: there is no such thing as balanced information. Do you think that Mr Nixon found the Watergate information balanced? Obviously not! Do you think that Mr Bush found the information about Abu Ghraib balanced? Of course not! Are you familiar with one of the great political issues – the Dreyfus affair in France – in which the government found that the information was balanced? With regard to research, for example, on the life and politics of Mr Berlusconi, do you think he finds that information balanced? Of course not! Information should upset politics. It upsets us, too, and sometimes that hurts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, Prime Minister Orbán, your law today is not a law that reflects the values of the European Union. You say that you want a strong Europe, Prime Minister Orbán. A strong Europe, Prime Minister Orbán, must be a credible Europe. If we agree to this kind of law in Europe, how are we going to have discussions with Mr Lukashenko? How are we going to have discussions with China? They all want balanced information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister Orbán, are you aware that Europe came into being against totalitarianisms? And that the basis of democracy, the basis of freedom, is precisely freedom of expression? A democracy never died from having too many freedoms. Democracies died when people started restricting freedoms, Prime Minister Orbán. You knew that twenty years ago. Think back to that time when it was so – and, what is more, it makes sense. You see, then, that what I am telling you is right.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to finish on one thing, Prime Minister Orbán. If you want to fight for the world’s Christians, we are with you, but I would have imagined, and I did imagine, that you would have welcomed the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, which is the same revolution you went through, Prime Minister Orbán: freeing yourself from a dictatorship. You did not have a word for the Tunisians, and it is for that reason that I reproach you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are with you for the world’s Christians. I trust that you will be with us when it comes to fighting the world’s dictatorships, whether they be in Belarus or whether they be in Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, China or Russia – wherever they be. These are the common values of Europe that we must all defend together.</p>

Hungary is at home here in Europe, and is worthy of holding the Presidency. But is the Hungarian Government at home? Is it worthy of this post? I am not merely referring to the media law here; there are nine other elephants in the room.

Nine amendments of the Constitution over the course of seven months. Restriction of the powers of the Constitutional Court. Nationalisation of the private pension system through open extortion, just as in Bolivia. The elevation of tax fraud to the level of government policy: Palinka distillation. Populist hacking, as though going at a botanical garden with an axe. Destruction of the fine fabric of society, of its solidarity. Ágnes Heller, János Kornai, Jenő Ranschburg – Hungarian scientists of world renown have written about this. Yesterday, Guy Verhofstadt said that the Belgian Presidency had been successful because their government had not allowed domestic tasks to distract them from European matters. Now we are facing the risk of the very opposite. The chaos and the diplomatic disaster at home will distract the government and the European public eye from Europe. This would truly be a shame.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make some brief remarks about the media law. Many speakers have mentioned this, but I will not repeat what they have said. I would just like to make one point. This is not interference in Hungarian affairs. I believe, and I have only learnt this late in life, that the media are responsible for monitoring those in power and the economy. This situation must remain unchanged. Therefore, the media must not be monitored themselves by other higher level bodies and a media authority of this kind would make this possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, the composition of the media authority is, in our eyes, not ideal. You have clearly stated that you are prepared to change this and I hope that you do move in this direction. Otherwise, and I would like to make this quite clear, it is a Hungarian affair. Of course, there are other Member States whose media legislation we could mention in this context. This does not only relate to Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say quite clearly with regard to your plans for the Council Presidency, firstly, that I welcome the fact that you have made promoting cultural diversity one of your overriding objectives. I believe that this is very important. I look forward to your initiatives to improve integration, including the integration of minorities, and you yourself have referred to the Roma. A European strategy to integrate the Roma more effectively is a very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I am pleased to see that you are committed to the enlargement negotiations and the policy with regard to our eastern neighbours. Bringing more Eastern European culture, together with the historical and social experience of the area, into the European Union can only be a good thing. For many reasons which I do not want to go into here, the European Union is still primarily a Western European institution. I would like to see your Council Presidency exerting a greater Eastern European influence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I will be interested to see how you handle the forthcoming reorganisation of agriculture and cohesion policy and the preparation of the European Union’s multiannual budgetary perspective. My group calls on you to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in all of this and we expect you take seriously your promise to support small and medium-sized businesses and to improve environmental protection, the sustainable use of resources and food security.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome Mr Orbán. After the six months’ farce of the Belgian Presidency, it is nice to see an elected Prime Minister from a proper country. How I enjoyed your denouncement of Communism as a dangerous ideology – and I noted the pride that you took in the fact that Hungary was the first country to take up arms against the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically, you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old Soviet Union. In fact, you are going to meet lots of Communists over the next six months, including the boss of the Commission here, old Barroso who was an advocate of Chairman Mao! You will see centralised economic planning and control and, above all, what you will see is the desire to impose a political union upon the peoples of Europe without their consent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Wake up Mr Orbán. Look at how they are trying to bully you this morning. They are trying to tell you how to run your own country. Tell them where to go. Stand up and fight for democracy once again.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1956 Hungary, showed the world that a stand must be made against oppression and lies, even if it seems to be a hopeless endeavour. At that time, this was our historic mission. And now it is the same. In today’s world, lies and oppression rest on two pillars. One of them is that global plutocracy and the banks are privatising profits, while nationalising losses and costs, thus passing them on to firemen, nurses, teachers and pensioners, who suffer more and more.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The other pillar is that they – and here I am referring mainly to politicians, who, instead of representing the interests of the people, persistently act as representatives of the global plutocracy and banks, even here in the European Union – make it all seem as if it were natural, or at least that there were no other way. The Hungarian Presidency and Hungary, my home country, must show that this is not true, that the emperor is naked. Instead of a mindset centred on profits and money, we must show that a human-centred and justice-centred approach is also possible, where the question we are asking is not about what is best for money and profits, but instead what is best for the people and for justice. I wish the best of luck to Hungary, my freedom-loving home country.</p>

It is not surprising that you support the Presidency from your position on the far right. However, whether that suits Mr Orbán is another matter. Are you aware that the Hungarian revolution was supported by many, many people and not only by conservatives on the right of the political spectrum, as Mr Schulz has said? Have you noticed, Mrs Morvai, that the criticism of the Hungarian media law has come not only from social democrats, but also from very many citizens, including Mr György Konrád, who have nothing to do with social democracy?

You left wing people continue to represent the interests of plutocracy and the banks, and show absolutely no regard for what people want. You have completely forgotten about the original ideals. There has been mention here today of your predecessor named Marx. What he said about justice is no longer referred to here. You are the greatest oppressors of the working people. This is one thing.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Hungarian delegation of the European People’s Party. I myself am a person with a disability, and I am perhaps more sensitive than the average person to discrimination or double standards. That is why I have been following with concern the political witch hunt about the Hungarian media law, which we could also witness here today in this House. Fidesz Hungarian Civic Union has demonstrated on countless occasions that it is doing its work in the spirit of our shared European values, and does so for the freedom of the press and with honour.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Our European values represent responsibilities. This is also proven by the six months of the upcoming Hungarian Presidency. This is also proven by its objectives. Economic governance, energy policy or, for that matter, the Roma strategy – these directions and strategies prove the existence of shared values, just as our goals are also shared in order to ensure a strong Europe. Europe is, after all, not just a community of interests, but also a community of values. In fact, you are now showing disregard for these very goals and values. Without even waiting to hear the opinion of the European Commission, you are already making statements, putting forward malicious accusations and making excessive and unfounded comments. Is your goal perhaps to weaken the Hungarian Presidency in doing so? In truth, you are inflicting harm on the European Union, on the entire European Community.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are currently facing our most severe crisis, and you are exhibiting irresponsible behaviour. As a Member of the delegation of the European People’s Party, I reject this. I encourage the Hungarian Presidency to continue its work despite the accusations and indeed to carry on with its ‘Strong Europe’ programme. I agree with the title of the programme. Through unity, we will achieve much more, and we must strive for progress.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, it is in the interests of the European Union and Hungary, as well as of all Hungarian patriots regardless of party affiliation, that the Hungarian Presidency be a successful one. This is even more important if we consider that today, the EU, including the euro area, is facing extraordinary challenges. Prime Minister, you are a man of purpose. I ask you to put this ability to the service of Europe as the President-in-Office of the European Union, so that Europe may become much more dynamic and efficient. At the same time, however, I ask you to preserve the rules of democracy and protect the values of the European social model.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Unfortunately, as the current debate has also shown, the beginnings of the Hungarian Presidency are turbulent. Can you feel, Prime Minister, how low the confidence in your government is in Europe? People in many Member States, regardless of party affiliation, consider the anti-democratic measures of your government, its economic populism, the media law and its tolerance for the far-right to be contrary to EU norms and values. The EU Presidency cannot absolve you from criticism; moreover, you should lead by example in adhering to the fundamental values of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The famous quote by Attila József, ‘my anger is for you, not against you,’ applies in this case, because when well-founded criticism is voiced, the EU is not angry with the Hungarian Government; it is angry for it. And this criticism is especially not directed at the Hungarian people. Prime Minister, as a Hungarian and a European, I would like to go through the six months of this Presidency with pride and with my head held high.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Orbán, in an article which appeared yesterday in a major German newspaper, you cited Otto Graf Lambsdorff as one of your role models. We last met at his funeral service in December 2009. You attended as a private individual and we very much appreciated that. I would like to ask you to honour his memory by respecting, following and defending the principles of the liberal constitutional state in all the measures that you take.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have responded to the criticism of the media law with two arguments. You have said that this is a campaign against Hungary and against you personally and that the campaign is unspecific. I would like to make it very clear on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that this is not a campaign. It is an issue for Europe if fundamental freedoms are interfered with and called into question in a Member State of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say to the Commission and to Mr Barroso that a legal assessment must be carried out by Mrs Kroes. However, the Commission is not just a solicitor’s office; it is also a political body. The assessment must take a political form and it must be completed quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Your second argument is that the criticism is unspecific. Mr Orbán, I would like to make a few specific points: slander, defamation and incitement to hatred are against the law in Germany and in other democracies. That is what the criminal law is there for. Please let the criminal law take effect in this case. You need to improve the legal protection in Article 163, change the composition and the powers of the media authority in Articles 123 and 183, together with a great deal of other things. There are many specific points. I suggest that you postpone the application of the law until the Commission’s assessment has been carried out and this must be done as quickly as possible.</p>

We cannot talk enough of civil rights and freedom of the press when it comes to countries which want to join the European Union, but these things do not seem to apply to the existing members of this club.

Even Hungary is asking everyone to keep their noses out of its business. That is a strange attitude for a Presidency of the European Union. It is your job, Prime Minister Orbán, to lead the European Union and, indeed, to encourage Member States to concern themselves with each other’s business to some extent. There is no place for retreat here.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is good news that a government enjoying so much support in its own country is taking over the EU Presidency. The Hungarian Government enjoys this support because it acts in the interests of Hungarians, and because it is rebuilding Hungary after the bankrupt, scandal-ridden governments of the Hungarian socialists. It is not such good news, however, that Hungary has been subject to unfair, ideologically-motivated attacks on the eve of its Presidency. The whole matter of the media law shows the hypocrisy of these attacks. There is an identical Media Council in Poland, where it is dominated by the governing party, and it is responsible today for dozens of people – journalists with conservative leanings – being thrown out of the Polish public media. No one in Europe, Mr Schulz least of all, is defending them. Those are the simple facts of the matter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The bizarre letter published a week ago attacking Hungarians, signed by the former presidents of the Czech Republic and Hungary, and also by the head of the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper in Poland, points to the hypocrisy of the attack. This is the very Gazeta Wyborcza which ensures that people who hold differing opinions have their property confiscated. The truth about today’s attack on Hungary is that it is nothing other than revenge for the putting into practice of successful conservatism.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I basically wished to speak about the Hungarian Presidency, but the speakers before me have infuriated me, and now I must give in a little to the provocation and speak about the Hungarian media law. To put it simply, in Hungary, the Jobbik Movement for a Better Hungary also criticised the language law. We, too, disagree with it. However, to see so many turncoats and hypocrites in one place is astonishing. Where were those who now fancy themselves as protectors of rights, where were you when the Slovak language law was introduced? Where was Mr Cohn-Bendit when the Hungarians in Vojvodina were terrorised by Serb extremists? Where was Mr Martin Schulz when graves in Vojvodina, Hungarian graves, and the graves of Hungarians in Transylvania were desecrated? This is why I see this as a double standard. I cannot accept the criticism you allow yourself against the Hungarian Government and against the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Unlike the empty cawing of MSZMP or MSZP , Jobbik has always had positive proposals. Yes, we must bring up the matter of the Slovak language law. Yes, we must bring up the matter of annulling the Beneš decrees. Yes, we must bring up the territorial autonomy of the Székely people. Yes, we must bring up the halting and elimination of Roma crime in Hungary and in all of Europe, and it would be welcome if the Hungarian Government could focus just as much on its domestic task of implementing the will of millions of Hungarian voters and finally putting the former Hungarian dictator, Ferenc Gyurcsány, behind bars. These are the real problems and I wish you success for the Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Orbán, you have two difficult tasks ahead of you. The first involves overcoming eight years of socialist maladministration, bringing political and economic dynamism and stability back to Hungary and reducing debt levels. The electorate has given you a clear mandate to do this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Your second task is to lead Europe in your role as President-in-Office of the Council during these difficult times and to do everything in your power to resolve the economic and financial crisis. You will have the active support of Parliament and of my group. We are pleased that you have not presented us with a wish list today, as many socialist Presidents-in-Office of the Council have done in recent years, but instead have made your priorities clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we are pleased that Hungary has been a member of the European Union since 2004 and that the governing party in Hungary belongs to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). The campaign relating to the new media law, which involves calls for the withdrawal of the right to vote under Article 7, and which was initiated here in Parliament and not by you, but by the parties that lost the 2010 elections in Hungary, they sat here and they are still sitting here now at the front, at least those who have not gone running straight to the press, is hypocritical and intolerable. The assessment will show that the media legislation in Hungary is no different to that in many other states.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of Mr Schulz, who called for the law to be withdrawn, I can only say that he obviously has not read the law which was voted in by a majority under the socialist and green state government in North Rhine-Westphalia. This includes provisions for the establishment of a media authority, for sanctions and for the diversity of opinions. This is exactly what you are doing.

Growth, jobs, a citizen-friendly Union: they all tend to become eternal objectives. We are actually at the point where we should recognise the failure of at least some of our policies and of the one-size-fits-all solutions that are too often applied.</p>
      <p sl="en">To stimulate the EU’s economic growth, maybe we should start thinking outside the box and accepting the various interests and specificities of our 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is proposing, and the Presidency endorses, a mere coordination of our economic policies. This might turn into a trap for exactly the economic growth we are seeking, with solely macro-economic and financial targets and policies. While we have an incomplete single market, red tape burdening companies and entrepreneurs, and a messy labour market, our EU growth might turn out to be that of a whale in a pool of barracudas – because such is the global market in today’s crisis context.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the founding of the European Union, one of its most important issues and challenges has been energy security. For a long time, we believed that the most critical point was the reduction of dependence on energy sources. The economic crisis, however, has clearly demonstrated that what is most important is accessibility and affordability. This was the first year in Hungary when more people froze to death in unheated flats than in the streets. A couple of days ago, the residents of a block of flats requested their heating to be turned off because they could no longer afford it. Ladies and gentlemen, it is very important for us to address the issue of energy security as one of the effects of the economic crisis, and we must do this on the background of our outdated energy infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The most important task of the Hungarian Presidency at the energy summit will be to lay down the foundations of this new infrastructure, not just in respect of gas, but electrical lines as well. Our task is not to upgrade the networks of the past, but to guarantee investors and capital binding capabilities for the intelligent energy networks of the future. The task before the Hungarian Government is to convince all Member States to support unanimously the increase in nuclear waste management security. We must guarantee that all this remains within the limits of affordability. Mr President, we cannot approach this with a hot head and cold blood, but only with a clear head, a clear heart and a clear vision. We will be your partners in solving these issues.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the peoples of Europe are experiencing a grave, destabilising crisis. I think that it is precisely at times like this that we need to go back to the fundamental values underpinning Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first of these values is the fight against all forms of nationalism. Let me tell you how concerned I am when, having offered the Hungarian nationality to the Magyar populations, you now raise the possibility of giving them the right to vote, in breach of all international conventions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second of these European values is the defence of democracy and freedoms. Now, since you came into office, a number of measures have been taken that are of such a nature as to cause us concern and regarding which you may now provide us with answers. The powers of the constitutional court have been restricted, the independence of the European Central Bank has been undermined – in contradiction of the Treaty of Accession – and you are getting people to vote on a media law which, under the pretext of transposing a European directive, is, in actual fact, a law that destroys press freedoms, as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) recently showed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You explain that your law is similar to that of other Member States, but even if some of them – and I am thinking in particular of my own country – clearly still have progress to make, in what other country of the Union does any part of the media risk a fine of EUR 700 000 for infringing moral standards? The affair is now in the hands of the European Commission, which must talk to us about the main issue, and beyond merely legal issues, whether this law infringes freedom of expression. Were that the case, the Union has instruments for guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights. This is the message of firmness that we are now awaiting.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Prime Minister, Hungary is a European country. It likes the European Parliament. Hungary has chosen as President of the Republic one of our very fine former colleagues, Mr Pál Schmitt, and you have been wise enough to choose as one of your ministers a very fine colleague of ours, Mrs Győri, to whom I pay tribute.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Democracy works. You have been elected. Well done! Europe works. A law of yours is challenged and you reply, ‘I will change it’. You are challenged on the application of values, and you have stated that, when reforming the constitution, which is the former communist constitution, you will adopt the entire Charter of Fundamental Rights. Well done! Politics works. Should anyone doubt the fact, we have a political Europe. That is good news!</p>
      <p sl="fr">You face economic challenges. You are putting the economy of Hungary right, Mr Orbán. You are probably the prime minister we need at this time. It is not the first time you have done this, though. You already did it in 1998, when you were prime minister then as well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will end by drawing your attention to Croatia. You want it to join. We are in favour of that. I would draw your attention to the misgivings of certain groups of European public opinion and suggest that you undertake a widespread publicity campaign capable of proving to European citizens that Croatia meets all the criteria for membership, because we no longer follow the course of block membership as we did after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Mr Orbán, on behalf of the Spanish Socialists, I would like to greet the Hungarian Presidency, the third Presidency in the first trio of presidencies under the new dynamic established in the Treaty of Lisbon. That requires consistency with the common script established by the three countries – Spain, Belgium and Hungary – but also, and most importantly, consistency with the principles, values and objectives established in the Treaty of Lisbon itself, because the absolute priority is to implement it and fulfil it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some of these common values and principles are established in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon: respect for freedoms, protection for minors and pluralism, which includes pluralism of information. I therefore share the concern that you expressed that such important objectives for the Hungarian Presidency may be distorted by national debates or peculiarities rather than by what unites us.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Hungarian media law absolutely cannot and must not be approached as an internal market issue in the national transposition of the Audiovisual Services Directive. It is a debate that does not affect just the internal market or only Hungary. It affects fundamental rights and the whole of the Union, and I therefore join those who are convinced that the only way that we will come out of this crisis is through greater integration, not through competitive nationalism.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Presidency will be judged based on its willingness to take the lead in fulfilling the values and objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon, remaining loyal to the commitments made in belonging to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Hungarian Presidency has a unique opportunity to put into practice energy security for Europe. There will be two consecutive presidencies – Hungarian and Polish – with strong political determination to use all the possibilities at hand. The issues we face so far are a consolidation or monopoly of supply and transit, lack of an interconnected single market and particular vulnerability on the Union’s eastern flank.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we expect from the Hungarian Presidency is that it will utilise the geometry of the Union in the form of a triangle: a north-south Baltic-Adriatic axis or corridor, with energy ports in Poland and Croatia, complemented by the Caspian gas pipeline supplying the EU directly, separately and independently, initially from Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. The Southern Corridor should obviously include the Nabucco project.</p>
      <p sl="en">So a new source of energy security for Europe is the ultimate challenge for the Hungarian Presidency. The three imperative aims are to build interconnectors, to ensure adequate funding and to boost the external dimension of EU energy policy because energy is a public good for the Union, it needs to be Europeanised, the policy must be based on solidarity, and our political will should guarantee its implementation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of a European Roma strategy was first put forward by the European Parliament in early 2008 and, in the three years that have passed since then, a whole array of EU actions and documents have proven the importance of combating the segregation and poverty afflicting the 12 million Roma of Europe. As a Member of Fidesz and the only Roma Member of the European Parliament, I am proud that the new Hungarian Government was the first among the Council presidencies to fully embrace the commitment and mission of providing a solution at European level.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The social inclusion of the Roma is one of the most serious challenges in Europe today and, at the same time, one of the most promising opportunities for our ageing societies. In fact, the integration of the Roma is not only a human rights obligation, but also an economic necessity. As the European Parliament’s rapporteur on this subject, I sincerely hope that, based on Parliament’s report and the Commission’s upcoming communication, the Hungarian Presidency will manage to draw up a strategy which is truly in the spirit of the Community, and which will define this target group on economic, rather than ethnic grounds, while reinforcing the implementation of the directives on equal opportunities, taking account of the territorial nature of segregation and mitigating the disadvantage of citizens living in micro-regions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Prime Minister, this process is about much more than European Roma strategy: it is about mutual trust, and about Europe’s ability to build a community of values and overcome the challenges lying before us. I wish you best of luck for these tremendous tasks. Taves bahtalo!</p>

Moreover, in order to concentrate on the problems of the EU, it is necessary to read this carefully and discuss whether it agrees with the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency or not, instead of discussing points or issues pertaining to life within Hungary, which can be regulated as part of a normal, healthy relationship between the Commission and the Hungarian Government and Parliament, if at all.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, please allow me to draw the following parallel in connection with the media law: in 1956, the majority of western communist parties, as well as a large number of western left-wing liberal intellectuals, condemned the Hungarian revolutionaries, and spoke against them in defence of the Soviet Bolsheviks. Mutatis mutandis , something similar is taking place today. Many of our western socialist and liberal colleagues are siding with a party of ex-communists and pseudo-liberals against the true force behind the change of regime, the followers of the late József Antall, the freedom fighters of Viktor Orbán. This is apparent in the context of the media law. Ladies and gentlemen, let us by no means mistake the once-champions and heirs of the past, these post-communists, with a true and credible left wing. The two are not the same. Back in his day, Albert Camus also had to realise who the Soviet Stalinists truly were, and took the side of the Hungarian revolution.</p>

I was assigned to teach two of my classmates German. I know all about the significance of the revolution. However, it was a revolution against the claim to power, against the monopoly of power. Its aim was to bring about freedom, including freedom of the press.</p>

I am pleased that you have promised to revise the law if it contravenes EU legislation and treaties, and I believe that even now, you are able to go back home and carry out revisions.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Prime Minister Orbán for his presentation of a very ambitious programme. I would also like to thank the Members for a lovely debate and an intense exchange of views.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that democratic debate is the best way to find the best solutions for Europe. However, there is one condition, and that is that the interlocutors must have a common goal. I believe that we have such a goal because most of us in this House want a stronger Europe. The motto chosen by the Hungarian Presidency is thus a very appropriate and good one. On behalf of the Commission, I would therefore emphasise that we must support the goals of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the debate made clear, there is a tall order for this semester. We have to introduce economic governance, find solutions to the sovereign debt crisis, and implement the EU 2020 strategy much more quickly – to name but a few of the aims in the economic field. However, we very much welcome the Hungarian Presidency’s focus on seeking a better solution regarding the integration of Roma, and on the Danube strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to comment on the issue of how to integrate Roma in the European Union more effectively. As you know, we engaged in a very broad programme to raise awareness and promote coordinated dialogue in the Member States on opportunities offered by EU funds. Following on from Hungary in 2009 and Romania in 2010, Slovakia and Bulgaria will be the focus this year. I believe that, together with you and with the Hungarian Presidency, we will be able in April to deliver the new EU framework for national Roma integration strategies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to comment on Mr Cohn-Bendit’s remarks because I consider it very important to demonstrate clearly at this time that the EU stands by Tunisia and its people. I would like, in particular, to pay tribute to the courage that all Tunisians have shown in recent days. I am sure that the EU will support Tunisians as they pursue their peaceful and democratic aspirations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new unity government should truly represent the wishes of Tunisian society. It should conduct the country through a peaceful and democratic transition and organise early elections. I would like to assure this Parliament that we stand ready to provide immediate assistance in preparing and organising the electoral process and to offer lasting support for a genuine democratic transition. If requested, we are also prepared to deploy the necessary assistance to help the Tunisian authorities with urgent needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In answer to the calls for swift action from the Commission on the question of media law, I would like to inform the honourable Members that our discussion with the Hungarian authorities at political level and at expert level is intense and ongoing. The Commission will send a clarification letter to Budapest this week seeking further explanations. I should like to emphasise once again that we are acting very swiftly, given the complexity of the issue. I must also repeat what President Barroso said: that we are much encouraged by Prime Minister Orbán’s political commitment to correcting the law if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are fully confident that Hungary will take all the necessary steps to ensure that the new media law is implemented with full respect for European values on media freedom and for the relevant EU legislation as well as the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission will, in this regard, act in full accordance with its role as guardian of the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to conclude by saying that we have full trust in the commitment and enthusiasm of the Hungarian Presidency. We have seen the solid preparation made by the Hungarian authorities for this task, with a view to being a very energetic Presidency in this important semester. We believe that together, we can further the European project. I am sure that the European Parliament will support this work and will play its role in a spirit of loyal cooperation. We clearly need to make very substantive progress on our top priorities in this semester.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament who honoured us with their speeches in today’s exciting and valuable debate. This debate was far too valuable for us to address the arguments put forward in a brief, one-minute reply. I will adhere to the time limit, but I cannot help but respond to some questions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">First, I will don the hat of Hungarian Prime Minister. Allow me to express my surprise that so many serious and respectable people, like those who have added their comments, are in factual error. It would be undeserved and embarrassing, not just for you but for me as well, if I gave a complete list of all the factual errors people, starting with Mr Schulz, have made here regarding the Hungarian media law and Hungarian democracy. Just to make the extent of your factual errors clear, let me give you one example: the Hungarian media law cannot sanction unbalanced reporting and cannot impose any financial penalties for it. So what are you protesting against? And the list could go on and on and on. I would therefore like to make it clear that I am sorry to see you have been so badly misled and deceived. I can now see clearly that in this debate, I cannot even hope to be treated fairly, and instead have to trust that the European Parliament will be able to form an unbiased, objective opinion, which, as a matter of fact, I personally will gladly accept, and will proceed according to the stated procedure.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Nevertheless, I wish to remind you that I believe that Mr Schulz’s idea that the Hungarian Presidency will be gauged not on the basis of the programme presented, but the performance delivered, is a valuable one. I can only recommend you to follow the same principle in respect of the Hungarian media law, which has been in force for weeks now. I will gladly send you German language excerpts from Hungarian newspapers and you will see that the fervent speeches of Mr Cohn-Bendit are but innocent baby sounds compared to what the Hungarian press is publishing. So much for factual accuracy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On the other hand, I would like to remind the critics of the media law that we are living in the 21st century. How can you possibly believe that anyone in Hungary, or in any other European country, would be capable of suppressing the freedom of opinion in the age of the Internet? During the Hungarian electoral campaign, we largely won the elections through an uncontrolled Internet and Facebook. How can you believe that, in the 21st century, one could restrict the free flow of opinions? I am shocked to see how much you are living in the past.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Similarly, I would only like to note as a matter of interest that the media law you are objecting to repealed the press act adopted in 1986, during the communist regime, which, until the adoption of the new media law, allowed newspapers to be terminated simply by deleting them from the register. Nobody ever complained about this in the past twenty years, even though it was most anti-democratic. I therefore suggest that we continue this media law debate in the spirit of reason and rational arguments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to inform you that, contrary to some of the opinions that were expressed here, Hungary is in the process of rebuilding the rule of law. I would like to point out that, although it was not the subject of your debates in the past years, the Hungarian secret services had been used for political purposes over those past years, and this is now the subject of court proceedings. In Hungary, the police had been ordered to use force against peaceful masses, and this is now the subject of criminal proceedings. In Hungary, information of public interest was falsified, and this is what resulted in the current state of our economy. Today, the rule of law is being reinforced in Hungary, after a policy of dismantling the rule of law, which, for some reason, never drew any criticism from you. Listening to the debate about the media law, I unfortunately had to conclude that it is not really the media law you are having a problem with, but with the fact that, in an act of solidarity unprecedented in Europe, the Hungarian people voted a two-thirds majority to a political force in Hungary. This is, without doubt, a very exciting and interesting question and I am convinced that this can be used for the benefit of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Since Mr Lambsdorff also made a personal observation, allow me to respond to that as well. Mr Lambsdorff, I address you as a European addresses a European, as a Hungarian addresses a German. Your media law is not one iota more democratic than its Hungarian counterpart, and if you dispute this claim, please do so in an objective debate. And I will not accept, either from the Germans or from anyone else, that just because we have been living under a dictatorship for forty years, anyone could call into question the Hungarian people’s commitment to democracy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Of course the media law can and should be criticised, and I accept this as natural, but a nation should not be insulted. And I would like to make it clear that calling into question the commitment of the Hungarian people and the Hungarian Government to democracy is an insult to the Hungarian people … (interruption, applause) . Please allow me to refer to the statement accusing Hungary of taking steps towards becoming a dictatorship. I was here and heard it with my own ears. What are you protesting against? I was here and heard it with my own ears! You threatened me, claiming that Hungary was moving towards becoming a dictatorship. What is this if not an insult to the Hungarian people? And, I must make this clear, I will always stand up to protect my home country, Hungary. This is not a matter of media laws!</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards European issues, if you will allow me, I will now put on my other hat as well. I consider the issue of the bond market, as referred to by Mr Verhofstadt, to be an important one, and I would like to state that the Hungarian Presidency believes that the formation of a bond market is necessary and inevitable in the long term. We therefore support the European policies that guide Hungary and EU Member States within the euro area, and the whole European Union, in this direction. I would like to point out one thing, namely, that we should convince our own governments, the national governments, that they must not use the creation of a euro bond market as an excuse for saving on structural reforms. We must therefore first undertake the necessary structural reforms, and after that I believe the introduction of the bond market will be possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards the matter of Tunisia, I would like to point out that we are in continuous consultations with the foreign representation, and we support all democratic efforts and movements outside the borders of Europe as well and, together with the foreign representative, we will demonstrate this with sufficient emphasis. However, we must not contrast this issue with the global trends in the persecution of Christians. Both problems need to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, there have been a number of comments expressing concern about the turbulent beginnings of the Hungarian Presidency, and that this could be detrimental to our EU Presidency. Let me tell you that this will all depend on you. We, for our part, are ready, as am I personally, to follow and nurture both threads of this twofold debate during the Hungarian Presidency. So if you feel that during the Hungarian Presidency, you wish to debate both Hungary and EU policies, I would like to state that we are ready for that, and will not consider this situation uncomfortable in the least. Not that we are happy about it, of course. We are not happy that critical opinions directed at Hungary are being jumbled up with matters of European policy, but we do not regard this situation as unnatural. Europe, too, is governed by democracy, and we are having democratic debates.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I never expected the Hungarian Presidency to be a simple victory procession, like a beauty pageant where the models parade themselves and everyone simply applauds. I was never under that assumption! I am well aware that we will be having serious political debates. I am ready for this, whatever the subject may be, and let me assure you that Hungary and the Hungarian Presidency possess enough strength to see the debate on both Hungary and European matters through with the necessary seriousness and strength, and that no attacks concerning internal politics or Hungarian affairs will dissuade us from following through with our EU programmes and priorities and making this a successful Presidency. My goal is to turn this half-year, which promises to be the most difficult one for the European Union as yet, into one of the most successful ones. Thank you for honouring me with your attention.</p>

I would like to give you some thoughts to take with you for the next six months relating to the remarks about the Hungarian people and about you as the representative of the Hungarian people. Mr Cohn-Bendit has described in his biography his relationship with the Hungarian people. In my group there are Members of the European Parliament who have been locked up in communist prisons. In my group, there is one Member, Mr Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez, who was subjected to torture in Spain because of his opposition to the Franco regime. We all have a joint task, you and all of us who are sitting here, and that is to defend democracy, for example, against the sort of people who are heckling us here today.</p>
      <p sl="de">No one who criticises a law is insulting the Hungarian people. You can be sure of one thing. The Members on the left of this House and, in particular, my group, will promise you that values such as freedom, democracy and justice are our common values. If we believe that a law does not live up to these values, then we will criticise the law, but this does not mean that we are criticising the Hungarian people.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">If we all take that to heart, Mr Orbán, then something will happen which we and you both need. We cannot create a successful Europe by dismembering it. Europe will only succeed if the sovereign Member States and the Union with its community work together. Do not play one off against the other. For the next six months, you have taken on the role of President-in-Office of the Council.

The European Commission must now be able to do its work in complete independence. That is the only way to break free of party political games. Media pluralism and freedom of the press are fundamental European values. All EU Member States, not just Hungary, have made a formal commitment to respect them.

      <p sl="lt">I would like to welcome Hungary which has begun its first Presidency in the European Union. Hungary, which has taken over the helm of the Presidency from the old Member State Belgium, begins its Presidency at a rather difficult time, because not all European Union Member States are enjoying an equally successful economic recovery following the economic and financial crisis. Furthermore, even more efforts will need to be made for the crisis to be overcome fully, and therefore I agree with the priorities set by Hungary on European economic stabilisation and the issues of EU enlargement, energy and Roma integration. I would like to draw attention to the fact that the directive on maternity leave, which was rejected by the Member States, ought to be reviewed as a matter of urgency, not to mention the uncertain outlook for the Anti-Discrimination Directive, which is still blocked in the Council. These laws are very relevant to European citizens, and therefore their future must be decided as quickly as possible. Furthermore, I would urge the country holding the Presidency to pay more attention to the modernisation of higher education, which has an impact on youth employment. I am pleased that in its programme, Hungary lists combating child poverty as one of its priorities, but I would urge the country holding the Presidency to take concrete measures in this area and to cooperate with the European Commission by initiating a strategy or legislation on child poverty. So I wish Hungary a successful Presidency in the coming six months, improving the situation for European citizens and safeguarding their rights and freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="en">The media law adopted by Hungary’s Parliament is clearly at odds with Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that guarantees freedom of expression and information. The watchdog established under this Hungarian law has been given the job of ensuring that journalistic reporting is ‘balanced’. This could seriously inhibit press freedom and leave the way clear for arbitrary rulings. Moreover, this same watchdog is made up of elected members of the sole party in government. Such a composition does nothing to ensure either the objectivity of the watchdog’s decisions or its independence as an authority from Hungary’s government. I urge the European Commission to proceed immediately with a legal examination of this law and its implementation and, if necessary, to take action in relation to Hungary to ensure that this law is amended and brought into line with the fundamental values on which the European Union is based.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We view the way things are developing in the European Union with great concern. The Hungarian Presidency has not given any credible responses to these problems, which also exist in other EU countries. Quite the contrary, President Orbán has reaffirmed authoritarian positions, insisting on the liberalisation of the financial markets, and on the structural reforms necessary to fully achieve the objectives of capitalism which the EU serves.</p>

With this in mind, I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, and the Polish Presidency which follows immediately after it, will contribute to the realisation of these specific projects, by turning our age-old friendship into fruitful cooperation within the framework of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the start of the Hungarian Presidency has been decidedly spoiled and dominated by the controversial media law recently adopted by the country. The EU institutions could not ignore this matter following the letter addressed to Brussels by a large number of European intellectuals. From the information available today, it appears that certain provisions of the Hungarian law, for example, those regarding the procedures for appointing and dismissing the National Media and Telecommunications Authority, and also those regarding the scope of competences of this body, may raise doubts as to the independence of the Hungarian media.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The strong reaction of my political group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is not, however, meant as criticism of the Hungarian nation, but of the state holding the EU Presidency. The matter is urgent.

      <p sl="hu">Nobody can deny that the Hungarian Presidency took a turbulent start. I was hoping that a convincing introduction by the Hungarian Prime Minister in Strasbourg would dispel the concerns. I note with regret that this was not the case. Mr Viktor Orbán did not introduce himself to the Groups of the European Parliament as a European politician who seeks consensus and compromise, but as a ‘fighter,’ striking populist and nationalist tones, who is ‘protecting the Hungarian people’ from ‘attacks’. However, neither the Hungarian people nor the Hungarian Government had been insulted by the Members of Parliament, but a great deal of criticism has been voiced against the troubling steps taken by Fidesz, including the media law. It was mostly the Eurosceptics and far-right speakers who adopted insulting tones as they lashed out in conspicuous concert against those criticising the Hungarian Government. It saddens me that the implementation of the Hungarian Presidency programme could be jeopardised by the government’s attacks on the rule of law. How events will play out after such a turbulent start will, contrary to Mr Viktor Orbán’s warning, not depend on the European Parliament, but instead on whether Fidesz and its leader will be willing and able to engage in politics that respect European values both at home and on the European stage. In fact, the Prime Minister cannot have two hats – one for use at home as head of the government, and one worn in Europe as the President-in-Office – but only one: that of the politician who keeps our shared principles and values equally in mind regardless of where he is.</p>

Social inclusion, demographic challenges, etc. are all important issues but the situation of women needs to be assessed separately because their problems and needs are different from those of men: on the labour market, and in relation to pension and healthcare schemes, taxation systems, etc.</p>

Since the first day of EU membership on 1 January 2007, the Bulgarian authorities have been working to make Bulgaria a reliable external border of the EU.

I expect the Hungarian Presidency to secure a European Council resolution in favour of Bulgaria and Romania’s membership of the Schengen area by the middle of 2011.

We have made considerable efforts to make the EU’s external border secure and, as is confirmed by the reports on my country’s accession to the Schengen area, Romania is ready to implement the Schengen acquis.

The Danube strategy is a common project where all the partners must fulfil their commitments to ensure it works and achieves the adopted objectives.

According to the document presented by Prime Minister Victor Orbán, the Hungarian Presidency declares: ‘We would like to admit these two Member States to the Schengen area as soon as they fulfil all the necessary conditions’. This statement is being made at a time when the discussion about accession to the Schengen area by both countries, which joined the EU in 2007, appears to be switching from a strictly technical to a political tone. There is talk already about postponing it, even if the technical requirements were met in full. This is why I think that an effort needs to be made to build up trust. Therefore, dialogue remains an essential tool. Without it, Europeans from Bulgaria or Romania will still feel excluded and discriminated against. Do we really need second-class European citizens?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Sport is one of the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. This is very important news for the sporting world and, above all, for the millions of Europeans who are involved in sport and recreational physical activity at grassroots level. Despite the new legal framework, there has been little progress in creating better funding conditions for sporting ventures in Europe. Amateur sport is passed over in public debate and social research, and the role it plays in preventing disease and improving Europeans’ living conditions and quality of life is underestimated. The benefits of regular exercise can be grouped under four headings: health benefits, social benefits, economic benefits and political benefits. Amateur sport makes it possible for many political goals to be achieved, including the promotion of health and culture, education, social integration, combating discrimination, reducing crime and fighting drug addition. Sport also means lower healthcare costs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would therefore like to draw the Hungarian Presidency’s attention to the European Parliament’s written declaration 62/2010 on increased European Union support for grassroots sport, of which I am a co-author. The declaration is proof of our commitment to sport and to improving the quality of life of the people living in Europe. In it, we call for grassroots sport to be given due attention in the communication on sport and for a guarantee of sufficient funding for the EU sports programme. Greater EU support for amateur sport means support for a healthier lifestyle for millions of Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The central motto of the Presidency as a whole is ‘Strong Europe’. The crisis and the decisions that have been made to date at Member State level have shown that we need more Europe, not less, in order to meet the challenges we currently face. Combating the crisis, overcoming the problem of the Member States’ public debt and continuing measures aimed at ensuring the stability of the euro area and strengthening economic governance should be priorities. The Hungarian Presidency is counting on the ‘human touch’ and, above all, on a rise in employment levels. Europe is aiming to achieve sustainable growth, which should be secured by means of job creation and social inclusion. In view of the need for increased security of gas supplies, we should take steps to establish a common energy policy as soon as possible. The regional aspect that can be seen in the programme of activities is to be welcomed. This includes, inter alia , the Danube strategy, a strategy on the Roma and issues relating to the Eastern Partnership. There are also plans to extend the Schengen area to include Romania and Bulgaria. This is a matter of vital importance, since all the Member States should enjoy the same rights. There is also talk of concluding accession negotiations with Croatia during the Hungarian Presidency. A responsible enlargement policy should bring stability, peace and cohesion to the continent of Europe. The point of reference for the work undertaken by the Belgian Presidency was Europe, in the full meaning of the term. This does not mean that the national approach, which is likely to be the one chosen by Hungary, cannot harmonise or even contrast with the Community approach.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In connection with the Hungarian Presidency, many people have criticised the carpet used as part of the image of the Presidency, especially its part that depicts a map of the events of 1848. The map in question is that of Europe in 1848. Among other things, this is meant to symbolise that, already in 1848, Hungary was fighting for the freedom of the people living in Europe, including for the freedom of the press. As a Hungarian of Transylvanian descent, I am today a citizen of Romania. As a citizen of this country, I would like to comment on the process of the expansion of the Schengen area. The twelve newest Member States undertook to participate in building a common Europe in the hope that the same rights and obligations would apply to them as to the old Member States. Romania, too, believed that, after fulfilling the relevant technical criteria, it could become part of the Schengen area, an area free of internal boundaries, at the pre-defined date. Yet now we can hear talk about some Member States intending to impose further conditions on Romania in addition to the pre-determined criteria. I ask the Hungarian Presidency to do everything within its power to ensure adherence to the common rules and to remind those who express their disagreement of the immeasurable negative consequences of such a decision, because maintaining the credibility of the EU is in the interest of all of us, of all 27 governments. Lastly, one final thought about the carpet: the carpet is a useful accessory, and does us a service: people can even wipe their feet on it. It signifies that the motto of the Hungarian Presidency, ‘Strong Europe’, represents service. We, the minorities of Romania, Slovakia and of Europe, will be partners in this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Hungary is taking up the Presidency of the EU at a time when the economic and financial crisis is continuing. The basic themes of the programme of the last country in the trio of presidencies, shared with Spain and Belgium, are economic recovery, the integration of the Roma people, an energy strategy, the enlargement process, and public involvement in the European project. In terms of economic recovery, the programme views the institutionalisation of the financial stabilisation mechanism and the European Semester as essential. I believe that strengthening cooperation and coordination at economic level is extremely important as a tool for promoting European competitiveness and innovation, and therefore for preventing and/or foreseeing future crises. The new 2011-2020 strategy for transport will be adopted, along with the amendments to the directive on the transport network that are essential in order to achieve the internal market and social, economic and territorial cohesion. Road transport, the navigation of EU rivers and the implementation of the Galileo system are other topics that will be debated. Once again, regional policy appears to be the lynchpin of the entire Hungarian strategy, capable of providing integrated responses to the economic crisis and regional imbalances. The allocation of the post-2014 multiannual financial framework seems to be the essential matter of debate for the Hungarian Presidency.</p>

There is one more issue I would like to highlight, as a Member dealing with institutional matters and, at the same time, a representative of the country which will take the helm of the European Union from Hungary. The Hungarian Presidency is extremely important, not only because of its priorities, which coincide with those of Poland, but also because it is still a transitional Presidency. The Treaty of Lisbon weakened the role of the Presidency, but this role has not yet been fully delineated, and now is the last chance to do so. The range of instruments subsequently available to the Poles will depend on the place the Hungarian Presidency succeeds in finding for itself within the institutional jigsaw puzzle that is the EU.

I hope that the Hungarian Presidency will follow the route taken by Belgium with a focus on the overall interests of Europe. The Hungarian Presidency has presented a comprehensive list of priorities. As one means of bringing the EU closer to its citizens, Hungary has set itself the objective of implementing the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This should be interesting when you consider that Hungary is currently subject to a barrage of international criticism because of its new media law and this law is clearly in conflict with Article 11 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. As a full member of the Committee on Budgets, I am particularly interested in developments in the area of increased financial supervision and the permanent crisis mechanism. Belgium has set a good example and has led the way in putting the focus on social issues. Let us hope that Hungary will follow.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, we have today achieved an historic compromise with this directive on patient’s rights. I believe this is the most historic agreement that we have concluded since I have been in Parliament. A historic compromise that has been cemented between two parties that have been a great distance apart for far too long, namely Parliament, on the one hand, and the Council, on the other. Through hard work, we have now succeeded in securing a compromise that will benefit patients, who will be protected against unreasonably long waiting times, and, at the same time, we have found a balance that will ensure that the Member States will be able to monitor what is happening from both a medical and a financial point of view.</p>
      <p sl="da">The result that we have achieved here today is an extremely good one that will benefit patients and the Member States.

      <p sl="da">I would say that there is clearly something fundamentally appealing about improving the chances for Europeans to be able to receive proper healthcare. However, the problems that this directive will create clearly overshadow the benefits that it contains. What will we do, for example, if there is so much pressure on any particular country’s health system that the waiting lists become unmanageable? What will we do if doctors start to send people en masse to a particular country – with prior authorisation of course, but nevertheless? It could be Denmark, where I come from, Germany, the Netherlands or another country in the EU where healthcare is known to be of a high quality. It will mean that the citizens of the country in question will be at the back of the queue and, in any case, that they must not be put at a disadvantage in spite of the fact that they are the ones who, via their taxes, have paid to have a proper healthcare system.</p>

This was dumped on us by the Court of Justice but I welcome it, and I want to compliment Ms Grossetête for producing an excellent report, because with this directive, patients will benefit from complete and transparent information when they resort to healthcare abroad. It is very clear what is in this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Patients with rare diseases will be able to benefit from cross-border expertise and diagnosis so long as the treatment is unavailable in their Member States. The directive is intended to offer patients a choice which is based on their needs, not their means, and which is informed and not made under duress, so I think it is very positive indeed. Finally, it allows cooperation between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that it outlaws completely something which could be abused and that is the whole area of medical tourism.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I voted in favour of the directive presented by Mrs Grossetête, so that the principle of cross-border treatment in the European Union can finally be put into practice after many years of negotiations. I regard the directive in its current form as a good compromise, based predominantly on patients’ rights, but also protecting the interests of the national health funds of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For citizens of countries such as Poland, the opportunity to receive treatment abroad means equal opportunities when it comes to benefiting from modern healthcare. Patients are often deprived of access to rapid and appropriate healthcare as a result of overcrowded hospitals, long queues and waiting lists for certain key procedures. Time is a huge factor in some cases. The directive will make it possible for citizens to decide for themselves whether to wait many months for the procedure to be carried out in their own country, or whether to choose somewhere else to receive treatment. It will be easier for them to decide how to be treated if they are aware of the fact that the costs of the procedure will also be reimbursed – at least to a large extent, and sometimes even entirely – if it is carried out in another European Union Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Simplifying the rules governing treatment abroad can, of course, also be seen as mobilising market forces in terms of general access to medical services. In my opinion, therefore, these solutions will help increase the competitiveness of health services and, as a result, also have a significant impact in terms of speeding up improvements in such services.</p>

It goes without saying that we should put in place instruments which prevent what is known as health tourism while, at the same time, making it easier for the patients who need it most to benefit from new opportunities. I am thinking primarily of treatment for unusual and rare diseases carried out in specialist centres, often outside the borders of the country in which the patient lives. We cannot, however, allow interference in the shape of the Member States’ health policies. This is a domestic competence, and the Member States are free to take their own decisions in this respect.

      <p sl="fi">This right of patients to cross-border healthcare will compel the Member States of the EU to ensure that there are no waiting lists in their own countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The prior authorisation system is necessary: without it, many Member States could have difficulties controlling the costs of their own healthcare system and planning and assessing the future. It might also have resulted in a situation where wealth, rather than necessity, would have been the decisive factor.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Nevertheless, this will not, in fact, affect very many Europeans. Most want to receive health services close to home and in their own language. Nevertheless, such a system is what is needed, and if there are waiting lists, it will be possible to receive care in another country.</p>

      <p sl="en">There are still a few matters that need to be ironed out. I think the mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important because this is not just about healthcare, it is about after-care as well, but we have a period of time in which that detail can be finalised.</p>
      <p sl="en">I suppose the final comment I would make is that, in the current financial crisis, a lot of citizens are asking: is Europe working? Is it delivering for its citizens? That is an open question, but I think today, we can say with some certainty that Europe is working.</p>

      <p sl="en">The NHS is already used as an international health service and is subject to widespread abuse by non-British citizens at costs of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of pounds each year. The burden falls chiefly on my constituents in London. This will open up the NHS to yet more commitment to provide treatment for EU citizens who have never paid a penny in tax in Britain. The supposed means of retrospectively obtaining payment from the patient’s Member State will prove unenforceable.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is right that a foreign national in Britain should receive emergency treatment when necessary, but no foreign nationals should be admitted to Britain unless they have first taken out adequate travel and health insurance.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I think it is excellent that this historic compromise has at last been found between Parliament and the Council. I might say that this regulation on cross-border healthcare could result in the waiting lists that have come into existence in many Member States being dissolved. This would also be an opportunity to exchange best practices. In this connection, it is also important to ensure that the interests or rights of patients are established. Furthermore, it is just as important to remember that patient safety is essential when we engage in cross-border cooperation, and to ensure, at the same time, that there are proper standards of healthcare and treatment everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I therefore enthusiastically welcomed this report by Mrs Grossetête and I hope that it will promote public health in Europe and that, as a result, we can save a lot of people and speed up their recovery.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I believe it is important that we do not use the national tax systems to work against the internal market. This is essential particularly in the case of cross-border services which is where equal treatment is needed. There is currently a negative example of this in Hungary, where retrospective price limits are being used as a form of crisis tax. This is not acceptable and it will have a serious impact on the financial, insurance and business sectors and also the energy industry. I hope that the same thing will not happen in future in the field of healthcare services.</p>

      <p sl="en">When my constituents write to me and say ‘Look, I am not getting a good service in my constituency and I would like to travel abroad to another EU Member State to get better health services’, they are uncertain of their legal position. That is why I and many others will welcome this vote today on patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. I hope that what we see in those jurisdictions where patients get a poor service will be patients voting with their feet, within their rights under this directive, and moving to another Member State, thereby pressurising healthcare systems to improve their service and to ensure that they meet their patients’ needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we have to make sure that we facilitate the procedure under which Member States can reclaim expenditure by any of their citizens who have travelled abroad or are offered services elsewhere. Once we have sorted out those problems, this ought to be a directive of which we can all be proud.</p>

It is vital to preserve the tropical forests to maintain the balance of our ecosystems. It is also vital to protect the indigenous peoples of the forest, who are under intense pressure from the exploitation of the environment by large multinationals and from the felling of the forests on which they depend for their livelihood, for the sake of those companies’ profits.</p>

We have seen this in the internal market amongst the EU Member States, and there is no doubt that this will also be the case where the developing countries are concerned. It is the only real development initiative that we can and should actually bring into the world.</p>
      <p sl="da">If we take a look around the world at how the other large regions operate, conclude agreements and view their partners from a strategic point of view, we can certainly see that they are all moving quicker and quicker. We have a large free trade area between North and South America, in the ASEAN countries, Asia and Mercosur, etc. The only area which, in this regard, is standing back and is almost paralysed by the challenges of globalisation is the EU.</p>
      <p sl="da">Even though I support the report that has been voted on today, I would like to say that a free trade initiative with Fiji and Papua New Guinea is scarcely the most impressive result that we could have expected after so many years of negotiations.

      <p sl="en">We can bring the benefits of free trade to many of the citizens of poorer countries while recognising some of the transitional problems they will have to face in adjusting to increased competition. However, at the end of the day, we should shift the focus from producer interests to consumers. Many consumers, in many different developing countries, ask me why they do not have the same choice on access to goods and services that we enjoy in the West. Well, one of the ways in which we can help them is through greater free trade, empowering our consumers to have greater choice. Long may that continue.</p>

      <p sl="en">One of the greatest things to have come out of this agreement so far is the fact that the rules of origin on fishing should finally enable the people in the Pacific Region to actually add value to their fishing.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, I voted in favour of the oral question on international adoption in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">International adoption has proved to be the procedure most likely to offer the chance of a permanent family to those children for whom a suitable family cannot be found in their country of origin. Cooperation among the Member State authorities with responsibility for international adoptions is important for ensuring that adoption is carried out in the child’s best interests and with respect for his or her fundamental rights, as well as for preventing the selling and trafficking of children.</p>
      <p sl="it">The international adoption procedure also needs to be simplified, because all too often there is too much red tape, which deters families from trying to adopt. Lastly, Romania gives cause for concern, since it is the only country in the European Union to have a law banning international adoptions. There are currently about 70 000 orphans in the country, 40 000 of whom are in orphanages and 30 000 in foster care.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission should cast some light on the case of Romania, so that those abandoned children can be welcomed into families through international adoption.</p>

It can, as the motion states, be an overly bureaucratic process and we are right as a Parliament to look for ways that such bureaucracy can be reduced with a more streamlined process.</p>

I know that adoption at present involves a lot of bureaucracy, and it is good that the bureaucracy can be eased in this way. As a result, the processes can be speeded up and made more transparent.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is in the interests of everyone that adoption does not involve anything that is unethical or linked to human trafficking or child trafficking. It is very important to ensure that a child is not a means to an end, but one who, through adoption, finds a loving home and who will be treated as a unique, precious individual. It is important that the child should have the chance to have a father and mother, to have that right, and that is why, when decisions on adoption are taken, it is important to take the overall situation in a family into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="fi">These are very sensitive issues. We know that some studies have shown that we carry our cultural genotype in our DNA, but we need to ensure that a child can benefit from a good, loving home and a cultural environment where he or she can grow and develop into a well-balanced person and citizen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Faced with a choice between democracy and supra-nationalism, the European Union almost always opts for supra-nationalism and nowhere is this clearer than in its policy in the Western Balkans. We are maintaining to all intents and purposes protectorates in Bosnia, in Kosovo and arguably even in Macedonia, for the sole purpose of preventing ethnographic boundaries along the lines of what local people there would choose.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very difficult to have a functioning democracy unless people feel enough in common with one another to accept government from each other’s hands. If you want government for and by the people, you have to have a people that everyone recognises some identity with, some allegiance to.</p>
      <p sl="en">To put it in another way, democracy needs a ‘demos’, a unit with which we identify when we use the word ‘we’. I am not saying it is simple. People can sustain multiple loyalties, populations can be interspersed, but our prejudice, other things being equal, should be towards national self-determination. If you take the ‘demos’ out of democracy, you are left only with the ‘kratos’, with the power of a system that must compel by law what it dare not ask in the name of civic patriotism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, here are my remarks on the resolution condemning Lithuania, because nothing happened. The text adopted lacks the most important point of view. What I wished to propose, unsuccessfully, as an oral amendment to the recital part, would be: ‘whereas the intervention of the European Parliament in the proceedings of national parliaments at the earliest stage of work on any proposed legislation is contrary to the fundamental principle of sovereignty and subsidiarity of Member States and therefore compromises the European Parliament as ever more linked to former Soviet practices’, etc. as adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">The pretext for such a resolution was just one draft amendment introduced by one Member of the national parliament. I stress, one amendment. Nevertheless, in the Parliament text just adopted, this fact was stubbornly and unreasonably presented in the plural, and it was even mentioned six times that allegedly there were many bad amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The title of the resolution includes an absurdity as well. It states ‘on violation’. There was no violation, only a proposal by one parliamentarian; there was no decision by parliament which could be blamed as a violation that happened. Statements such as these reflect an extremely low quality of drafting work, not to say a lack of responsibility by those who drafted and presented for a vote this text, which required far more intelligent elaboration at least, if it was not simply discarded for trash. Therefore, I voted against the whole thing.</p>

I do not think there will be. A point that has been missed in this debate, as Mr Landsbergis has just reminded us and as Mr van Dalen reminded us earlier, is that this is a proposal. It is not a legislative resolution.</p>

I was against it even in the very earliest days when it was still called Section 27. It seemed to me utterly invidious to use the law as a mechanism to signal approval or disapproval. When we did that, we put an incredibly powerful weapon into the hands of the state that was later used in the bans on pistols and hunting and so on.</p>

It must be said that today, there is too much uncertainty surrounding the issues of access to care, reimbursements and responsibility for clinical follow-up in relation to cross-border healthcare. This directive is intended to allow all patients – and not only the best informed or richest – to enjoy a series of healthcare rights which have already been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union. It should be stressed that the aim of this document is absolutely not to encourage cross-border healthcare as such, but to ensure its availability, safety and quality when it is of use or necessary. European Union citizens must receive better information and more clarity regarding the legal rules applicable to travel to a Member State other than the Member State of affiliation for the purpose of receiving healthcare. I agree that we must combat ‘medical tourism’, but in order to protect patients’ rights, we must introduce a simplified prior authorisation system for patients which will nevertheless ensure that healthcare managers are given advance warning of any exceptional costs related to travel to healthcare institutions in other EU Member States.</p>

The issue of the recognition of prescriptions in the Union has also yet to be resolved, which causes great problems for people who travel. I do not feel that the free movement of patients and the right to choose treatment in another Member State will encourage medical tourism.

I would like to stress that this directive must be aimed at all patients – and not only the best informed or richest – and should ensure the safety of all patients. Already at first reading, Parliament came out in favour of this directive, but, unfortunately, the Council did not take all of Parliament’s amendments into account. For instance, the Council ignored the very important issue of the treatment of rare diseases. However, around 25 million Europeans suffer from rare diseases and they should therefore be given the opportunity to receive healthcare in other Member States. Furthermore, I agree with Parliament’s position that, in order to avoid discrimination against people on lower incomes, the Member State of origin must pay the hospital in the other Member State that is providing the treatment directly, without requiring citizens to settle an account in advance, or any costs incurred by the patient should at least be reimbursed immediately. It is also very important for every Member State to maintain national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information, i.e. about the availability of healthcare, procedures and the required documentation.</p>

While it has, so far, been the better informed or more motivated patients that have made use of the advantages of cross-border healthcare, this possibility is now opening up for everyone else. I agree with the conditional payment of costs based on prior consent in justified and precisely defined cases, when the cross-border healthcare includes a patient stay of at least one night in hospital, and requires highly specialised and costly medical equipment, or there is a particular risk for the patient or the general population. In these cases, I consider prior consent to be an instrument for preventing excessive health tourism.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The increase in health tourism does not reflect well on many European health systems. If a patient is facing an unreasonably long waiting time in his home country, however, we should not be surprised if he wants to travel to a place where he will receive more rapid and also perhaps better quality healthcare.

In accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, this directive allows the European public the greater security of enabling them to benefit from the healthcare they need in a different Member State and to be reimbursed up to the amount set out by their national system. It is important to create a system of prior authorisation for hospital care which is simplified and does not act as an obstacle to patients receiving safe and good quality medical care.

It allows European patients to benefit from treatments that are not available in their own countries or for which there are very long waiting lists.

Patients today wishing to avail themselves of medical services in a country other than their own come up against many administrative and financial obstacles. As a result, only the most affluent can afford the luxury of treatment abroad. In response to these problems, the proposal for a directive provides for administrative procedures to be simplified as much as possible, for example, by limiting the obligation for prior authorisation of treatment by the national healthcare body, and by ensuring better exchange of information on medical services in other countries by setting up national contact points. This does not mean promoting ‘health tourism’, as some are claiming, but ensuring the right to reliable, high quality care when it is needed.

The legislators’ role is to adopt a law that will minimise the formalities involved in accessing doctors and allow citizens suffering from ill health to have a wide choice of medical services. I am therefore wholeheartedly in favour of the proposal for a directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare and hope that the negotiations, which have already gone on for seven years, will result in an agreement with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the end, I voted for the directive on cross-border healthcare. The compromise between Parliament and the Council is acceptable, in particular, because it recognises the right of States to take measures to safeguard the financial equilibrium of their social security systems, not least through a prior authorisation system for the financial reimbursement of hospital treatment received in another Member State. This will prevent any kind of health tourism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The former Commission was misguided in thinking that healthcare was just another commercial service. Some MEPs are mistaken when they proclaim that ‘the Europe of health is now a reality’.

That, unfortunately, is the reality that cannot be glossed over by the directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the Grossetête report on the adoption of a directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. Today’s vote has brought us one step closer to codifying patients’ rights into European law. It is imperative that once this directive comes into force, patients are not left to shoulder the economic burden of cross-border healthcare and that reimbursement is carried out in a timely, expedient and smooth manner. High quality, equity, solidarity and universality in healthcare must remain the guiding principles during the transposition and implementation phases in the various Member States. In addition to this, governments should make public timelines and action plans on how best to monitor and ensure this kind of implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, for this directive to be truly effective, the Commission must monitor and supervise the coordination between the Member State of affiliation and that of treatment and ensure that any inequalities and disparities in access to cross-border care and treatment by patients are averted.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As someone who hails from the only region in France to share a border with three other EU Member States and who represents a constituency that is particularly affected by cross-border issues, I am very sensitive to these problems. Indeed, borders are still too often obstacles in areas of everyday cross-border life. Europe is founded on the principle of free movement of persons; this freedom, this mobility of citizens must apply to patients, too. Hence, the issue of cross-border healthcare is clearly a crucial one. That is why I voted resolutely in favour of this report on patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. This text will enable patients to seek treatment more easily in another Member State. Above all, it clarifies the rules that will apply; patients will be able to access more information (in particular, via contact points) about their rights or about reimbursement. This is therefore a decisive and a very concrete step that will bring real added value to the construction of a social Europe and of a true Europe of health.</p>

The provision of healthcare services in the shortest possible time and with a clear patient focus, which can also be used by other Member States, is an essential requirement in order to bring Europe closer together. Cross-border healthcare is a day-to-day reality in border areas like the one which I come from. Against this background, I am very pleased that it will be easier to access reliable, high quality cross-border healthcare and to have treatment costs reimbursed. I am particularly in favour of providing added value for patients who are on waiting lists. These new regulations will enable them to be treated more quickly in another Member State, rather than waiting a long time for treatment in their own country. It is true that establishing the rules for the refusal of prior authorisation is sensible and makes the situation clearer. However, some cross-border healthcare problems remain unresolved, in particular, for long-term cross-border commuters, who, after they have retired, will have no access or only restricted access to services which are important to them in the country where they previously worked.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare is a key step towards abolishing the barriers which patients have encountered in the EU Member States to date. Its primary goal is to make it easier for Europeans to access healthcare in other EU Member States and, in particular, to access services which are not readily available in their own country. This is particularly good news for those who live in cross-border areas and, above all, for individuals suffering from rare diseases who need specialist treatment which is not available in their own country. I am also pleased to see a number of provisions which ensure certain benefits for patients, such as the mutual recognition of prescriptions, the removal of the need for additional insurance abroad and access to medical records. The idea of creating national contact points, with the task of informing patients about their rights, is also key.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Patients should be comprehensively informed about the procedures for accessing treatment abroad. They should be similarly informed about the procedures for obtaining reimbursements for the costs of such treatment, which will be reimbursed according to the current costs in the country in which the patient is insured.

It is regrettable that today, there is too much uncertainty surrounding access to care, reimbursements and responsibility for clinical follow-up in relation to cross-border healthcare. This directive is intended to allow all patients – and not only the best informed or richest – to enjoy a series of healthcare rights which have already been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The aim of this document is absolutely not to encourage cross-border healthcare as such, but to ensure its availability, safety and quality when it is of use or necessary. The directive is intended to offer patients a choice which is based on their needs, not their means, and which is informed, not made under duress. Furthermore, I agree with Parliament’s position that, in order to avoid discrimination against people on lower incomes, the Member State of origin must pay directly the hospital in the other Member State that is providing the treatment, without requiring citizens to settle an account in advance, or any costs incurred by the patient should at least be reimbursed immediately. It is also very important for every Member State to establish national contact centres to provide patients with all the necessary information, i.e. about the availability of healthcare, procedures and the required documentation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of adopting the Grossetête report for several key reasons. The directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare has many positive features. It abolishes barriers to treatment, ensures equal access for all to healthcare throughout the EU, marks an end to discrimination against patients, introduces the mutual recognition of prescriptions, reduces waiting times for doctors’ appointments and removes the need for additional insurance abroad. The fact that the directive introduces wide-ranging access to medical care for individuals suffering from rare diseases, and higher rates of reimbursement for disabled people, are additional points in its favour.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The directive works to prevent medical tourism by stipulating that the costs of treatment will be reimbursed up to the level guaranteed in the insuring country, and if the costs actually incurred are lower than this, they will be reimbursed in full.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of authorisation has given rise to much debate. The prior agreement of the national health fund will only be required in the case of hospital treatment or expensive medical procedures, and it will not be required for any other form of treatment, provided that they are covered by what is known as the basket of guaranteed services. If a Member State has not authorised patients to receive specialist treatment at national level, the directive does not create any new right for patients to receive such treatment abroad or for the costs of treatment to be reimbursed. A key exception is the case of individuals with rare diseases.</p>

      <p sl="lv">The directive on the right of European Union citizens to receive medical treatment in any of the 27 Member States is a significant step towards better healthcare in the European Union. It is particularly timely given the widespread labour mobility within the EU. When the directive comes into force, patients will be offered extensive information on the new rules so that citizens can come to know what opportunities they have and make full use of them. Citizens will be able to receive initial treatment in any Member State, and doctors will not be able to withhold treatment. The directive provides that, in future, citizens will be able to choose in which Member State to receive planned medical services.</p>
      <p sl="lv">They will, however, have to obtain an advance authorisation from their home state, as payment for the treatment will be made at the prices prevailing in the state where the patient is living.

We should recall that citizens have the right to receive medical services in one of the Member States if such services are not available to them where they live. This is particularly important in cases of complicated or rare health problems. For this reason, both my group and I support this directive, because it represents an important step on the part of Parliament; one that will have a beneficial effect on the lives of the people of Europe.</p>

This result will benefit patients and significantly cut waiting lists, which are sometimes excessively long. Our society is increasingly mobile, and I think that, now more than ever, it is important to facilitate mobility among European Union citizens, including in a vitally important area such as healthcare.

However, the regulations will only be useful if they can also guarantee that there will be no health tourism, which would put even more pressure on the already hard-hit health insurance companies. Apart from the fact that some areas of medicine in countries with high medical standards could rapidly be overwhelmed, there is also the risk that poorer EU Member States, which have invested less in healthcare, will be required to pay massive costs. In this context, we must also not overlook the fact that the system which should allow the social security systems of EU countries to reimburse one another does not function and that debts of millions of euro have accrued over a number of years. Although the Member States can, in theory, exclude certain types of treatment if they are concerned that the influx of patients from abroad will put their healthcare systems at risk, in practice, this will not be so simple.

The new directive guarantees the mutual recognition of prescriptions and easier access to information on treatment abroad, as well as increasing the scope of treatment for individuals suffering from rare diseases and providing more opportunity for disabled people to obtain higher rates of reimbursement of the costs of medical care.

      <p sl="pt">Certain measures are required in order to achieve the goal of building an internal market based on free movement between the Member States. The free movement of people and services draws particular attention to the healthcare that the nationals of a Member State can receive in another Member State. The Court of Justice has recognised the rights of patients, specifically in terms of access to healthcare, ensuring that such healthcare is high quality and safe, and that patients should be reimbursed. The demand for greater legal certainty in this area implies a commitment from the Member States to cooperate with one another, particularly by recognising medical prescriptions issued in other Member States and ensuring a quality service in their own territory. I would stress the fact that the Commission is obliged to take measures in order to make it easier to understand information regarding prescriptions and instructions on the use of medicines, indicating the active substance and the dosage, which will clearly be beneficial to patients. Given the specific nature of this issue, there needs to be a separate directive from the one on services. I voted in favour of the report by my colleague from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mrs Grossetête, as I believe that the affirmation of the right of patients to cross-border healthcare is relevant.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare is an extremely important document for EU citizens, and so I have followed work on the issue very attentively. I am pleased to note that the directive gives patients the right to choose the place where healthcare will be provided, thereby strengthening the common market, which is the main subject of my work in the European Parliament. This also means that it introduces adaptations which take account of citizens’ freedom to travel and work in any EU Member State. This directive, which could be called a Schengen for health, covers such issues as the mutual recognition of prescriptions, an end to discrimination against patients on the grounds of country of origin and the removal of the need for additional insurance abroad.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of counterfeit drugs and medicinal products is another very important issue from the point of view of the common market. The directive stresses that they are a serious problem, particularly in the context of cross-border healthcare, and the same is true for medical tourism. The directive tackles this problem by ensuring that the costs of treatment are reimbursed to the level guaranteed in the country of origin, or, if the treatment or procedure cost less than this sum, that the actual costs incurred are reimbursed. The solutions introduced will help to improve the situation of patients in the European Union and will strengthen the common market, and so I voted in favour of adoption of the directive.</p>

I am pleased that this report also talks about patient mobility in the EU. Lithuanians living and working abroad must be guaranteed the opportunity to obtain treatment if necessary, without paying absurd amounts of money or waiting for months in uncertainty. Information is the key. I support the rapporteur’s proposal that every Member State should maintain national contact points to inform patients about the availability of healthcare and administrative procedures. Sometimes, however, treatment is not available for all illnesses in a citizen’s own country, and in such cases therefore, treatment should be provided in another country. We must strive to ensure that cross-border healthcare services or ‘medical tourism’ (as the rapporteur observes in this case) do not weaken our national healthcare systems. There needs to be a perfect balance. Low prices and easy travel are making Lithuania particularly attractive to other EU residents who may be looking abroad for opportunities of cheaper treatment and cheaper operations. Unless it is strictly controlled, ‘medical tourism’ could cause a surplus of services or unnecessary logistic costs, particularly for new EU Member States like Lithuania.</p>

More generally, these agreements recall the responsibilities incumbent on the European Union when it negotiates trade agreements. The European Commission must conduct a consistent trade policy and must ensure that trade agreements do not lead to large-scale deforestation so as to satisfy the demands for free trade in timber or biofuel production.

However, it still falls short of what is needed to tackle the causes of the problem of illegal or unsustainable logging. In particular, it is important to mention that this problem cannot be separated from the enormous weaknesses in the economies of these countries and the significant levels of poverty amongst their peoples, and that, at times, this activity is the only source of income for many families. This inevitably leads to the conclusion, included in our proposed amendment, which was unfortunately rejected, that it is only possible to put a stop to illegal or unsustainable logging if the terrible social and economic situation in these countries is addressed, reversing an economic model based on heavy dependence on exploiting and exporting a select number of raw materials to industrialised countries, which fosters neo-colonial relationships of dependence, and encourages the plundering of resources from developing countries and their subjugation.</p>

It must be stressed that these voluntary agreements on trade in timber must not run counter to the EU’s overall objective in terms of combating climate change and must guarantee sustainable forest use, stop deforestation and forest degradation, and related carbon emissions and biodiversity loss globally.</p>

      <p sl="it">The draft resolution in question concerns the important partnership agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cameroon. The main aim of this partnership is to provide a legislative framework within which to ensure the traceability of timber, put in place procedures to certify the quantities of timber exported from Cameroon to European countries, and check that the trade complies with legal and, above all, environmental requirements. Cameroon is the largest African exporter of hardwoods to Europe, which purchases 80% of its production. In the light of this fact, we must consider the need to adopt monitoring systems and procedures in this area of the market in order to avoid market activities being carried out using illegal procedures. I decided to support this recommendation because I am convinced of the need to develop agreements with countries outside Europe. However, I would emphasise that these partnerships must comply with the rules laid down to safeguard the environment and must be subject to stringent controls, in order to ensure that these activities become true opportunities for development and growth.</p>

Corruption is a fact of life in Cameroon. In the world rankings produced by Transparency International in 2010, it was in 146th place. Environmental organisations claim that the government of Cameroon is aware of the environmental crimes being committed by the forestry industry, but that corruption is preventing the companies from being monitored and prosecuted.

Experts estimate that, in 10 to 15 years, the most ecologically important tree species in the Congo Basin will have disappeared if the logging continues in the same way as it has been done up to now – aimed at maximum yield. This ultimately threatens the green lungs of Africa, which are vitally important for the global climate, and endangers the unique flora and fauna of Cameroon. To protect Cameroon’s tropical forests, what is essential is the combating of corruption and bribery (at the level of the officials and also of the community tenants of state-owned forests), effective criminal prosecutions, sustainable forestry, where the quantity felled is only as much as will regrow, and better training for loggers in order to prevent damage to the land during logging. Above all, European companies must take some responsibility, because around 80% of the yield is shipped to Europe. The EU must act in this regard by taking direct and decisive measures. I have therefore voted in favour of this report, as it is moving in the right direction.</p>

The concerns expressed by the rapporteur himself are enough to prove the weakness of the agreement, justifying our abstention. Specifically, the agreement does not, of itself, ensure that deforestation and the large-scale degradation of intact forests will be combated, and it may even promote them in the absence of additional or complementary measures, as it is aimed at encouraging the importing of timber products from the Republic of Congo to the EU.

Irrespective of their purpose and the rhetoric with which they are presented, these agreements are essentially aimed at free trade, with all the extremely negative consequences that result from it. Recently, in the last ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which took place in December 2010, the Council of the ACP countries expressed their concern with the fact that the European Commission is not respecting its objections on matters relating to protecting its economies. There is also a contradiction between the Commission’s much-vaunted flexibility and the inflexible stance that it has taken in the technical negotiations. In this Interim Economic Partnership Agreement with the Republic of the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea, the EU has also been subjected to severe criticism by social and political organisations in the Pacific Region due to the pressures that have been put on these two countries to sign the agreement, under the threat of losing their privileged access to European markets. Critics have also said that there has been a significant decline in solidarity between the Pacific States since the signing of this agreement, creating feelings of division, which has lead to the break-up of certain regional groups due to the pressures that they felt that they were under to sign the interim agreements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Now, the ones profiting from this are the Chinese, Australian, Thai and any other fishing fleets which unload their catch in Papuan ports.

The Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea have decided to conclude the agreement mainly in the hope of protecting their sugar and tuna industries. The interim agreement covers rules of origin in relation to fisheries, textiles and agriculture whilst, however, establishing derogations that could threaten the competitiveness of some EU industries. As regards the tuna canning sector, the derogation granted enables countries like Papua New Guinea to operate as genuine hubs for the processing of huge quantities of tuna from a variety of sources: the Philippines, Thailand, China, the United States, Australia, etc. This tuna is landed in Papua New Guinea’s ports and processed in factories that have been hastily set up by operators from the countries concerned for the sole purpose of benefiting from the total customs duty exemption granted by the EU under this interim agreement. This has been damaging the European canning sector, which has been complaining of unfair competition.</p>

Furthermore, a predictable unfettered increase in traditional exports, concentrated in raw materials such as copper, sugar, copra, fish and palm oil (agro-fuels!) is entirely at odds with sustainable development needs. Hence, Greens supported the Pacific Trade Ministers’ (unsuccessful) request to revise critical elements of the IEPA, namely, the definition of ‘substantially all trade’, the ban on the use of export taxes and weak infant industry safeguards, and the Most Favoured Nation (MNF) clause.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The EC/Pacific Interim Economic Partnership Agreement grants goods from the Pacific Region preferential conditions of access to the European market. I am in favour of the development of this region, but I feel that the derogation from the rules of origin for processed fishery products is unacceptable, as it allows for products manufactured in a country from raw materials which were not sourced from that country to be exempted from customs duties. This derogation is proving to be an incentive to fish in the tropical area without any concern for the management of fish stocks. Insofar as trade preferences do not only affect fishing zones in Papua New Guinea, it is difficult to monitor the origin of the catches, and this runs counter to the commitments made by the European Union to put a stop to illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing. I am also concerned about the traceability of products to be imported into Europe from this area. By voting against, I wanted to show my disapproval of such a clause, which, in my view, should no longer figure in any trade agreement in the future.</p>

The 1967 European Convention on the adoption of minors aims to coordinate the laws of Member States relating to adoption.

      <p sl="ro">Romania is the European state which probably allowed the worst abuses to be committed regarding international adoption in the 1990s, immediately after the fall of Communism. Indeed, this was due to the lack of experience in a state which lived through a dark period for almost half a century, but equally to those who were fully prepared to exploit these weaknesses. This resulted in losing track of almost a thousand children involved in international adoptions. With the support of the European Union, which we were preparing to join, Romania carried out far-reaching amendments to its adoption legislation, in spite of the huge international pressure not to resort to a drastic measure such as abandoning international adoptions. In these circumstances, and judging by Romania’s sad experience with international adoptions, the reluctance to accept a body like the European Adoption Agency, which will result in the creation of an actual European adoption market, is understandable.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Any resolution on international adoptions can only have the safety of minors as its objective, regardless of the interests of the states or the adopters.

Indeed, placing the child in an institution ought to be used simply as a temporary solution. At the same time, it is important for an EU-level methodology framework to be devised to carry out the assessment of the adopted children’s development in their new families, using regular post-adoption reports compiled by the social services in the country where the adopted children have gone and submitted to the competent authorities in the country from which they were adopted.

      <p sl="ro">Serbia has received encouragement with the vote on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. I hope that the ratification process will be speeded up by the vote of approval given today in the European Parliament. I should remark that one issue highlighted in the report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is linked to Serbia’s failure to recognise the authorities in Kosovo and to the maintenance of parallel structures. Romania, for its part, has not recognised Kosovo’s independence, which was declared unilaterally, in breach of international law. Serbia is an excellent neighbour to Romania, with centuries of history linking us. Indeed, Romania understands and supports its friends. Serbia’s future obviously lies in Europe and its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia should demonstrate Belgrade’s commitment to European values, democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Serbia will clearly have to follow the same path for joining the EU followed by all Member States. However, it must receive equal treatment with regard to this path. Recent developments have shown that Serbia has understood the European community’s expectations of it. Tangible progress has been made, but the EU must handle tactfully certain aspects of Belgrade’s recent history which weigh heavily on the Serbian people.</p>

Its involvement as the aggressor in fratricidal wars, and the brutal impact that they have had on neighbouring countries and on the international community as a whole have had serious consequences for the country and its people. The secession of Kosovo, which remains a deeply controversial subject, has heightened tensions in the region and continues to have an immense potential to cause instability.

      <p sl="pt">We voted against this resolution, chiefly because of the demands that are made on Serbia and the EU’s unacceptable position regarding Kosovo. For instance, Parliament is calling upon the Serbian Government to dismantle parallel structures within Kosovo which it claims ‘undermine the decentralisation process and prevent the full integration of the Serbian community into Kosovo’s institutions’, as well as the demands that it continues to make regarding cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. This pressure on Serbia is unacceptable, and is all the more complicated given that equivalent measures have not been taken in relation to Kosovo, despite public complaints about the trafficking of human organs by Kosovo’s current leaders.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is also unacceptable for Parliament to put pressure on Serbia to ‘enter into dialogue with Kosovo without referring anymore to new negotiations neither on the status nor partition’.</p>

In the case of the Western Balkans, including Serbia, it seems that the only possible route is accession to the EU. However, that accession is bound by a series of conditions. Serbia is demonstrating an outstanding predisposition for moving towards becoming part of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, despite the consent given today by Parliament, a resolution has also been adopted which, despite being the positive resolution adopted by this House in relation to Serbia, points out that Belgrade’s cooperation with the International Criminal Court and a full commitment to democracy and the rule of law continue to be imperative in its journey towards the EU.</p>

Dementia is a group of neurodegenerative diseases which should not be thought of as a normal part of ageing.

Since the population of Europe is ageing, and the social and economic consequences are also greatly affecting health systems in the Member States, action and specific initiatives need to be taken as a matter of urgency to combat this serious disease. Europe’s recent findings show that Alzheimer’s disease remains underdiagnosed in the EU and that many inequalities exist across the Member States in regard to prevention, access to treatment and provision of appropriate services. The focus should be on early diagnosis and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. Diet is a significant causal factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease and therefore, the prevention of dementia through modifiable interventions should be a priority and particular attention should be given to preventive factors such as a healthy diet, promoting physical and cognitive activity and controlling cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension and smoking, Furthermore, it is essential to enhance the dignity of all patients throughout the process of their disease and reduce inequalities, in other words, to safeguard the existence of services that guarantee coverage and equal conditions as regards access and treatment for patients, regardless of their age, gender, financial resources or place of residence.</p>

This is why coordination between Member States needs to be improved, along with adopting a more effective and solidarity-based response geared towards prevention and the treatment of people living with dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s, as well as towards supporting the people around them.

These strategies must address the disease’s social and health consequences, as well as the services and support necessary for sufferers and their families. Efforts to promote early diagnosis and health services focusing on prevention and research must become a health priority at European Union level too. The establishment of a public-private research, development and investment programme must therefore be encouraged at European level.

According to the 2010 report of Alzheimer’s Disease International, approximately 9.9 million people in Europe are affected and it is predicted that this number will rise considerably by 2020. The lack of professional carers for people with Alzheimer’s has to be a cause for considerable concern, since this situation will tend to get worse in the future if measures are not taken. These measures must include the training of a sufficient number of health and social services professionals and the guarantee of appropriate care provision through public services, respecting the wish of patients to remain in their own home environment wherever possible and promoting the fundamental principles of dignity and social inclusion and also the independence and self-determination of the patients. Since this is a disease where the medication costs are very high and cannot be met by the majority of patients, increased funding for these drugs is desirable.

      <p sl="it">I must also emphasise that it is important to take into account the specific needs of women, who account for twice the number of sufferers and a disproportionate number of carers in the areas of medical and social research, health and social policies. Alzheimer’s disease is a major challenge to European society. It is only by making a joint effort that we will be able to address the social and health consequences of dementia and provide services and support for people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, as well as for their families.</p>

I cannot, therefore, fail to support this EU initiative, which aims to make combating dementia one of the EU’s priorities.

      <p sl="de">Alzheimer’s is an insidious disease for which there are no effective drugs, despite extensive research. It is unlikely that we will find a cure in the near future for the disease and its consequences, such as increasing loss of memory and of other higher brain functions, which lead to a state of complete dependence on others. This makes it even more important to start treatment at an early stage. One important measure involves educating the public about prevention, but also about early recognition and delaying the onset of the disease. Many general practitioners are apparently beginning the treatment with anti-dementia drugs too late, in order not to exceed their budgets, and this is counter-productive. According to medical experts, treatment with the right medicines can postpone for up to a year the need for the person suffering from the disease to move into an expensive care home.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, it is important not to forget the severe physical and mental stresses suffered by the relatives who care for these sick people. These stresses lead to depression, burnout and similar disorders among around a third of carers. We are attempting to alleviate the suffering of people with Alzheimer’s disease at an EU level.

Therefore, this report is a step forward in the fight against this serious disease.

Parliament recently held a debate on issues relating to elderly people in the context of the economic crisis, labour market demands and raising employment levels. Statistics on the number of people diagnosed with dementia reveal the enormity of the problem. Every year, 1.4 million Europeans develop one of the forms of dementia, and the number of sufferers is estimated at 10 million. In Poland, over 200 000 people suffer from Alzheimer’s disease. Neurodegenerative diseases are one of the leading causes of disability among elderly people, and the problem is becoming worse as a result of the increase in the average lifespan.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Alzheimer’s disease is a major economic challenge for all societies. The World Alzheimer Report published in 2010 states that the worldwide annual costs of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia amount to USD 600 billion. We need a joint European strategy in the fight against dementia. We must develop and promote preventive measures against Alzheimer’s disease or, in other words, a healthy lifestyle, which means staying physically and mentally active, being involved in the community and eating a healthy diet. Those caring for patients should be guaranteed appropriate financial and psychological support.

In addition, I would also ask that we pay attention to the increasing number of surgeries for dementia-friendly communities being set up in countries like Germany, Belgium and Scotland. We must also consider the impact of expectations on the evolution of this disease.

The Member States must share their expertise and involve both scientists and healthcare professionals in the process. The alarming number of people suffering from the disease and the resulting costs for the individual Member States make the need for prevention urgent. This must take the form of a healthy diet and measures to delay the onset of the disease. The report also refers to the provision of practical and psychological support for relatives. It has been shown that a patient who is cared for at home needs three carers, who generally have to give up their jobs.

I agree with the very important call for a strong, long-term commitment from the international community, including the EU, to honour all the pledges made at the International Donors’ Conference in New York. It is important to take immediate action and coordinate the provision of humanitarian aid to the people of Haiti, more than a million of whom are still living in makeshift camps that were supposed to be temporary. Human rights associations continue to deplore the appalling living conditions in these camps, in particular, the ‘rape and sexual violence’ to which women are subjected.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, over the long term, it is clear that humanitarian agencies cannot and must not continue to make up for the weaknesses of the Haitian State or to take its place, and that urgent action must finally be taken to ensure long-term development, in particular, as regards access to healthcare and drinking water and urban renewal. At a political level, there is a need for immediate action to build the capacity of the Haitian State in terms of democracy and good governance, which are essential for national reconstruction, and to ensure that Haitian civil society and the Haitian people are involved</p>

      <p sl="lt">I supported this resolution which assesses the situation in Haiti, one year after the earthquake. The situation in the country remains very complex and chaotic, reconstruction efforts are struggling to get off the ground, millions of people are starving, and the earthquake has had a huge impact on more than 800 000 children, exposing them to the risk of violence, sexual abuse, trafficking and exploitation, The situation in the country became even worse with a political crisis following the presidential and parliamentary elections. Although the international community reacted effectively to the tragedy in Haiti, allocating financial and humanitarian assistance, hitherto, only a small portion of the USD 10 billion pledged has been paid. The cholera epidemic that has gripped the country has highlighted the incapacity of the Haitian State to react appropriately to the situation, along with the limitations of the international aid system. The continuing political unrest is hampering efforts to begin reconstruction work and help victims, and is making the situation even worse. The European Union, as the leading donor, must exercise political leadership in coordinating reconstruction efforts in Haiti and ensuring that aid reaches those who need it most.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The situation in Haiti has become extremely grave at a time when all the international community’s efforts have not helped to improve the situation in this state, devastated by civil war and natural disasters, and now hit by a cholera epidemic. Last year’s devastating earthquake brought Haiti to the attention of the global public. However, in spite of the joint efforts made on the back of a wave of strong emotion, the situation is not changing for the better. This is why the most important aspect of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament is probably the call to the UN to rethink the mandate of MINUSTAH in Haiti as a result of the epidemic and tensions caused by the recent, fiercely fought national elections, whose integrity is being seriously questioned by the international community. The poor population of the small state is actually the big loser in terms of all these problems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vitally important for the UN to be and remain in charge of coordinating all the civilian and military operations with the aim of both restoring security and providing humanitarian aid, and of carrying out reconstruction and development. The entire international community and the European Union, in particular, must place their involvement in rebuilding Haiti as high as possible on their own agendas before it is too late for its population.</p>

      <p sl="pt">However, the scale of the disaster in Haiti is lamentable and its effects are still highly visible a year on from the earthquake. Safety, health, public health and housing conditions are also lamentable, and it is vital to rebuild the capacity of the Haitian State in terms of democracy and good governance, which are essential for national reconstruction, and to ensure that Haitian civil society and the Haitian people are involved. It remains crucial to help this country recover from the earthquake, but it is also important that the international community take advantage of this opportunity to help to resolve the economic, social and political inequalities within Haiti.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This status quo has to be changed! The international community, in liaison with the Haitian Government, must enter into a firm, long-term commitment, honour the promises made, and make every effort to protect the Haitian people.

      <p sl="pt">Moreover, I regard it as essential for the reconstruction efforts to include local food production and food security through the development of rural infrastructures and aid to small farmers.

      <p sl="ro">It is important to Haiti’s inhabitants that the European Union shows solidarity with them after the disaster which has hit them, causing significant human and material losses. I therefore welcome Europe’s decision to commit to providing financial assistance for the reconstruction process in this country, amounting to roughly EUR 1.2 billion, as well as the proposal from the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton, to adopt an economic plan for the next 10 years, focusing on both development and growth in the region, along with the country’s reconstruction. It is an important decision, especially as the EU is one of the biggest donors to this country in the Caribbean region. However, I think that EU funds ought to be distributed according to criteria similar to those applied in Member States or according to specific programmes, not only for rebuilding houses, schools, roads and other infrastructural items, but also for granting micro-credits which will boost development and the launch of micro-projects for economic recovery, based on the current model used in the EU for micro-enterprises. In the wake of the Second World War, the United States implemented the Marshall Plan, which made a key contribution to the rebuilding of Western Europe. Europe, in turn, can launch a similar programme for Haiti.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The terrible disaster that struck Haiti a year ago shocked us all and led to a global current of good will, making logistical, human, financial and humanitarian resources available immediately and on a large scale.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With a year gone by, it was appropriate to reassess the situation on the ground, not least because Haiti no longer dominates the headlines in the mass media. The tabled resolution makes this assessment, and points out paths and solutions to the immense and serious problems experienced by the population in their day-to-day lives. As far as I am concerned, it does it well: all that is missing is a greater tendency towards involving local communities and associations in distribution, and in seeking solutions for the future.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, I would stress the strong focus on ‘long-term commitment’ and on seeking solutions that ‘tackle the root causes of underlying poverty in Haiti once and for all’, and the call for the EU/Member States to incorporate ‘local food production and food security into the reconstruction effort in Haiti, via the development of rural infrastructure and the provision of aid to small farmers’.</p>

      <p sl="pt">A little over a year ago, the world was stunned by the consequences of the earthquake that devastated Haiti, killing more than 200 000 people and leaving behind a trail of absolutely horrific destruction in its wake. At the time, the international community mobilised itself to come to the aid of the victims, while the international institutions, as well as worldwide public opinion and the media, echoed this commitment. Unfortunately, the focus of international attention seems to have moved elsewhere, so it is the duty of the European Parliament to recall what has happened and report on the current situation. One year on, it has to be realised that nothing has changed significantly and that the country, which was already in serious difficulties and collapsed through an act of nature, has not yet managed to recover. The data available having been collated, all the indicators point to this fact: nothing seems to have progressed quickly, with the necessary efficiency or with adequate competence. More than a million people are still homeless. The international community cannot abandon this country and allow it to become one more failed state.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The reality on the ground shows what the resolution seems to want to hide, which is that the principal preoccupation of the United States, shared by the EU, was to secure and perpetuate its political interference in order to ensure its economic and geostrategic domination of Haiti, ignoring the human drama that Haitians have been living for decades. After imposing structural adjustment policies on the country, through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which destroyed its economy and created a catastrophic social situation, the US responded to last year’s earthquake with a military invasion. All this was recently exacerbated by a cholera epidemic, which we now know was brought in by soldiers of the UN mission in the country, the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) (although it denies any responsibility). The majority in Parliament has said nothing about these facts. Nor has anything been said about those who have shown Haiti a true attitude of solidarity: Cuba and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA). Cuba has sent doctors and specialist personnel who, up to now, have treated more than 50 000 people against cholera and, with the help of the Haitian authorities, it has now been possible to reach the most isolated communities, thereby guaranteeing that no citizen of this country is left without help to face cholera, thus allowing thousands of lives to be saved.</p>

In addition to this, despite the fact that elections were held in November, amid strong suspicions of vote rigging, the country is still without a government. In today’s vote, we have asked the European Union to cooperate with the Haitian institutions with the aim of developing rules and regulations which will help the country to make better use of all the financial aid it has received over the last year and, above all, to do so according to principles of democracy and legality.

In view of the country’s current situation, the European Parliament calls on the European Union and the international community as a whole to show solidarity with the island and to cooperate more closely with the Haitian authorities, as well as stating that any measures to reconstruct the country should be taken only after consulting those living there.

      <p sl="pt">On 12 November 2010, the Lithuanian Parliament decided to initiate the process of appraising the change to the Lithuanian Administrative Code, according to which the public promotion of homosexual relations must be punishable with a fine. The Lithuanian authorities are in the process of considering these changes. This fact is relevant to our deliberations to the extent that no legislation has yet been passed that breaches any EU rule. Therefore, I shall refrain from appraising political, legislative and jurisdictional acts that lie strictly within the competence of the Lithuanian legislative, executive and judicial authorities. However, I do urge the Lithuanian authorities to maintain respect for liberty and the principle of equality and non-discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>

I would stress acknowledgement of and respect for the right of a Member State, such as Lithuania, to freely discuss and compare different concepts and ideas during the process of amending and passing national legislation. I would also stress the Lithuanian authorities’ reaffirmation of their determination to respect the European legal framework and not go against it, as well as to promote respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Lithuania is attempting to control the preaching of certain minority sexual orientations, no doubt wishing, and quite rightly so, to promote instead the family, consisting of a father, a mother and their children, which forms the fundamental unit of any society. Some people see this as an unacceptable attack on human rights and as outright discrimination. However, as the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) rightly points out, the legislative process under way in Lithuania is a long way from being completed and is currently being examined by the relevant oversight bodies in the light of the country’s constitutional and international obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The resolution also emphasises ‘the right of any democracy [ …] to modify and adopt national laws and provisions, without interfering in the debates of national parliaments’. However, the very fact that we are discussing the issue here and tabling texts constitutes interference and is a violation of Lithuania’s rights and those of its citizens. This is unacceptable. Since the subjects are connected, I would also like to take the opportunity as a French citizen to express my grave concern about the case taken to France’s Constitutional Court in the name of non-discrimination, challenging the articles of the Civil Code that quite naturally enshrine the principle of marriage as the union between a man and a woman.</p>

Let us remind ourselves that there is no place for homophobia in Europe and that Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights clearly prohibits all discrimination on a variety of different grounds, including sexual orientation. The Council is still blocking the introduction of a cross-cutting directive on combating discrimination aimed at guaranteeing equal protection against all forms of discrimination.

It was in line with this principle that I voted in favour of this resolution, because I believe that, while the European Parliament may not wish to interfere in a country’s internal affairs, it should always be able to express its opinions and to act as a sounding board in order to convey the needs of the European public as a whole. The resolution adopted today serves to highlight our Parliament’s common position with regard to the Lithuanian Seimas. It consists of a request to amend draft legislation that would amend the Code of Administrative Offences to punish the ‘public promotion of homosexual relations’, which, as the text clearly emphasises, could potentially criminalise almost any public expression or portrayal of, or information about, homosexuality. Therefore, I believe that it is our duty today as MEPs, but as citizens before that, to ask the Lithuanian Parliament to reject the new legislation in the name of the essential principle of safeguarding fundamental human rights.</p>

We should be taking on the fight against homophobia here in this House and in our national parliaments. It is also important to point out that the text we are discussing today is only a bill at this stage, presented by a few members of the Lithuanian Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall begin by expressing how fully I share the concerns of this House about the recent violence against people belonging to religious minorities, as well as those who stand up for religious freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">I expressed my views on this issue most recently on 6 January when I visited Bethlehem and the Church of the Nativity on the eve of the Orthodox Christmas. I went there to underline the need for all religious groups around the world to be able to gather and to worship freely. I also stressed that the European Union condemns all forms of intolerance and violence against people because of their religion, wherever it takes place. I have also strongly condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Iraq and Egypt targeting places of worship, as well as the assassination of Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of the Punjab in Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">These attacks are unacceptable: they are perpetrated by extremists with an agenda of intolerance which must be condemned and must be resisted. Honourable Members, all too often in today’s world, people’s human rights are violated because of their religion or belief. The victims do not belong to a single faith or to one region. Regrettably, no part of the world is spared from the scourge of religious intolerance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any discrimination or violence against individuals because of their religious beliefs runs counter to the values that we in the European Union uphold. Each violation must be taken seriously and each must be condemned with equal force wherever it takes place and whoever the victim may be, because, as we know and accept, human rights are universal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Long-established Christian communities in the Middle East face difficulties which have led to significant displacement in some countries and to a dwindling of numbers in the region as a whole. The European Union will not turn a blind eye to their plight. We consider their demand to have their rights respected as citizens of their own country to be entirely legitimate. Freedom of conscience and of belief belongs to everyone and every state has the duty to ensure it is respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU stands ready to enhance its cooperation with governments in order to combat intolerance and protect human rights. We must not fall into the trap that extremists and terrorists are laying for us: we must resist the manipulation of religion into a source of division. The best response to extremism is a united international front based on the universal standards of freedom of religion and freedom of belief.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union was a driving force in the UN General Assembly behind the resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief – which was adopted by consensus in December 2010. We make a concerted effort every year to build on that consensus, so that the international community can send a firm and united message. We are considering another initiative to rally strong cross-regional support on this theme at the forthcoming session of the UN Human Rights Council in March. We also raise the issue of freedom of religion or belief during our human rights dialogues and urge countries to eradicate discrimination and intolerance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our delegations closely monitor these issues around the world, and the European Union’s next annual human rights report this spring will address the situation of religious minorities around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I am fully committed to keeping freedom of religion or belief at the top of our agenda. The next Foreign Affairs Council on 31 January will again address this issue so that the European Union can step up its efforts to promote religious freedom.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have promised us that you will appear more often in front of the European Parliament, so that this will be settled. I believe that it is important for you, Baroness Ashton, and for everyone else to note that a broad majority of the European Parliament is in support of this issue and that this is an indication that it is part of a sequence of measures and not just a normal resolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">You are right when you say that we must ensure that intolerance and violence against people because of their religion, regardless of the religion in question, is regarded as unacceptable. However, it is clear that 75% of the attacks made for this reason in recent years have been directed against Christians. Christian Europe must take a self-confident approach and defend itself. It must not remain silent on this issue. The attacks are taking place to a large extent in Muslim states, but not only there. Christians are being persecuted in China, for example, and in other countries. We must not accept violent discrimination or acts of terrorism. Imposing the death penalty on someone because they have converted to Christianity is not acceptable and neither are the acts of terrorism and terrorist organisations or the fact that public bodies, which are not themselves responsible, turn a blind eye to these actions. The result of this is that the tradition, which dates back millennia, of Christian groups and communities being present in many countries, including Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran, is coming to an end. If the pressure continues on Christians in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, there will soon be no Christians living there. The 20 million Coptic Christians living in Egypt represent a specific problem which we take very seriously. We cannot talk about minorities in this case.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, I would like to highlight two demands made in the resolution. There must be clear references to the persecution of Christians in the human rights reports produced by the institutions of the European Union, including your organisation and the European Parliament. Resources must be made available within the External Action Service to handle the subject of Christianity and the issues of human rights and freedom of religion must play a major role in the treaties which we sign with other countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, thank you for your clear statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">The increasing number of attacks on Christians and the growing levels of religious intolerance are highly alarming. We must make clear our condemnation of these acts, because we are supporters of religious tolerance, freedom and diversity. I would like once again to express our deepest sympathy and regret concerning the attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt. This was a heavy blow not only against the Coptic Christians themselves, but also against the tolerance which is still widespread in Egypt. I say ‘still’ advisedly, because unfortunately, it has now been put at risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">On behalf of my group, I would like to express my very deep regret about the way in which Christians are being treated in Iraq. The aim of overthrowing Saddam Hussein was not to bring about the lack of tolerance of Christians that we are seeing now. However, there is also intolerance between different Muslim groups. Therefore, our group believes that it is particularly important to take decisive action against intolerance of other religious views and especially of religious minorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hardly ever make written statements, but I was happy to become involved in this case at the invitation of Mr Maurer, because it is so important for us to combat growing intolerance and to work together to overcome it. I am pleased that we have a joint resolution and a joint basis for action.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, in just the same way that I clearly condemn these attacks against Christians on behalf of my group, and not just the recent violent attacks, but also other discrimination, I would like to state specifically that I very much regret the growing Islamophobia in certain circles in Europe. This is simply an argument, which is admittedly wrong and invalid, but still another argument that allows certain radical Muslim forces to find a cause, a reason and a justification for discriminating against or even attacking Christians.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of us, whatever our views of individual religions, must admit that people have the right to practise their religion in peace. The existence of an aggressive, violent minority, whether it consists of Muslims, Christians, Jews or members of other faith communities, can never provide a justification for attacking other religions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, religious conviction is an individual matter with a different meaning to different people. The role of the state is to protect all citizens, regardless of their conviction, and to allow them to freely associate and express themselves across the world. A glance at our world today shows a very bleak picture: from the Bahá’i in Iran to Copts in Egypt, from the use of blasphemy laws in Pakistan to the attacks on Christians or places of worship in Iraq and Nigeria. Today, we highlight the increased violence against Christians specifically, which provides a reason for great concern. It is incredibly painful that people attack and get attacked, both in the name of religion, and people of all faiths are victims.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is unacceptable to see that some individuals, extremists, choose to use violence and even terrorism and do so in the name of god or in the name of a religion, claiming thereby to speak on behalf of others or even seeking to be above the law and thus associating countless innocent people with this violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">But let us not be mistaken. By giving the extremists more credit than they deserve, by accepting the link between religion and terrorism, we disqualify the majority of believers who, in the diverse ways in which they do, practice their faith peacefully. Terrorism is political and terrorism is a crime. Religion can never be a credible or acceptable reason to use violence or to breach human rights. Too often this does happen, not only through violence, but also in limiting freedom of expression such as through the abuse of blasphemy laws.</p>
      <p sl="de">Religion or conviction should never be a reason for people to live in fear and the European Parliament rightly speaks out against the extremist acts against Christians and supports those who condemn this extremism.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the massacres inflicted on the Coptic Christians in Alexandria provoked international outrage. The Eastern Christians’ situation as a whole is worrying: in Iraq, in Lebanon and even in Palestine, where Christians are leaving what they see as their Holy Land, worn down by the humiliation they have suffered under Israeli occupation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am glad that our resolution on freedom of religion gives the subject a broad interpretation and recalls the fundamental rights: the right to believe and not to believe; the right to choose a religion without being discriminated against. Whilst our text quite rightly mentions the recent attacks and killings that have gone on in the world, we must also admit that in some European countries, respect for this freedom of religion is under threat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We often witness acts of intolerance: the profaning of Jewish and Muslim cemeteries, anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic talk. Actions such as Switzerland’s vote to ban the construction of minarets and the rise of extremist parties who express intolerant views against certain communities are all signs that we must make the fight to uphold secular principles a priority in Europe. Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and ethnic and religious minorities are all facing a worrying increase in violations of their universal fundamental rights.</p>

China, India and Vietnam must hear our views on religious freedom in the framework of trade negotiations with the European Union. We must reinvigorate our neighbourhood policy when it comes to countries such as Egypt. Ultimately, our diplomacy must respond to each violation of the right to religious freedom. We therefore have the instruments at our disposal, we need only use them, and we must also convince the world that, after years of silence on the matter, the freedom of Christians really is important to us.

      <p sl="it">The most worrying part of this in institutional terms is the systematic curtailment of Christians’ rights as citizens, in that they are not allowed, for instance, to build churches, take public, civil or military office or freely practise their religion, amongst other things. The two things together – terrorism and discrimination – force hundreds of thousands of people to leave these countries. In Iraq, for example, over 60% of Christians have been forced into exile, and we are talking about some 600 000 people.</p>

In several countries where the majority of the population are Muslim, even some that are seen as being moderate, Christians are treated as second-class citizens.

      <p sl="fr">In those same Muslim countries, anyone who actually or reportedly criticises Islam can face the same fate. In particular, legislation supposedly aimed at repressing blasphemy must be repealed. We specifically call on Pakistan to quash the conviction of the poor woman who was accused by her neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can talk as much as we want, but fine words are not enough. We must act and make it clear to these States that our relationships with them are dependent upon whether they are willing to respect freedom of conscience.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer the Commissioner my heartfelt thanks for the content of her speech, because the purpose of our resolution here is to ensure greater protection for religious minorities in everyone’s interest.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, Baroness Ashton, speaking with the greatest sincerity, cordiality and friendship, I would like to bring something to your attention: if you have the patience to re-read the text that you have just read out, you will notice that you managed to give your whole speech without once using the adjective ‘Christian’. That is something that struck me, because there is actually a feeling of embarrassment in our institutions, and in that sense we are playing the game of the fundamentalists, who tend to identify the presence of Christians in the Middle East and other parts of the world precisely with the West and Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">My Iraqi Christian friends and our Palestinian Christian friends are Arabs, think in Arabic, love their country, love that mentality and love their history and culture. I would like to ask you, therefore, Baroness Ashton, whether we should not perhaps take a very thorough, careful look at ourselves and how we have approached this subject up to now, because it is a strong point of ours to call a spade a spade.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is what we must do: we must call hatred for Jews anti-Semitism, hatred for Muslims Islamophobia, and hatred for Christians by the name it deserves, because that is the only way we will succeed in involving everyone in those countries who loves justice and freedom.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is my question to you, and I would ask you to be specific in your answer. We are now about to adopt the agreement on Iraq. Let us include proper rules alongside the principles of a trade agreement, so that there can be economic advantages in exchange for rights. Let us do something tangible and in everyone’s interests, but let us do it quickly and well, because the world is waiting for a signal from Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to begin by reminding us of the words of the Universal Declaration. I quote, ‘Freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance’. It makes the point that protection of these freedoms is integral to, and inseparable from, the protection of all human rights. Our determination to defend them should be no less.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also makes clear that we should act against all religious persecution, which is a problem for all religions and in many countries including – let us be honest – some of the countries of our own European Union. The Pew Centre says that 70% of the world’s six billion people live in countries with strong restrictions on religious belief or practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally have a strong conviction that religion can be a force for good, upheld by the work of the Faith Council in my own east-of-England constituency which promotes mutual understanding, a role mirrored in the European Union’s own obligations for dialogue, as outlined in our resolution. But I know that when preacher of hate Terry Jones, who threatened to burn the Koran, said he would come to Luton – also in my constituency – to stir up religious hatred, he was told he would not be welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tolerance, dialogue, mutual respect and understanding are, for some, parts of their faith. For others they are values in their own right. Either way, they are values that we should promote and respect.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The terrible killings carried out by al-Qaeda in Iraq and Egypt and the threats that Eastern Christians face from Islamic fundamentalists are, in reality, aimed at only one thing: creating tension between religions, fuelling hatred, setting communities against each other and provoking a clash of civilisations. This attempt at destabilisation will fail in Europe, as it is failing in France, where the whole Muslim community naturally condemned these barbaric acts immediately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must solemnly reaffirm today the right of all minorities to practise their religion freely and safely everywhere in the world, including here at home in Europe. We must defend religious pluralism, tolerance and mutual understanding both here in Europe and everywhere in the world. This is why I hold the hope that the democratic revolution that Tunisia is experiencing will soon reach other countries, so that the values of respect, tolerance and secularism will spread.</p>

Have this House, my group and I, myself, not already asked many questions about the systematic suppression of Christians in these Islamic countries? With that in mind, I believe that the time for talking and fine pronouncements is over. It is time for action.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have two specific questions for Mrs Ashton. First of all, although the remit of the European External Action Service should be limited, the Service must take one task very seriously: it has to stand up for Christians who are being persecuted. Therefore, establish a separate unit within the Service that will be responsible for this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the European Union has signed bilateral agreements with all those countries. Freeze those agreements, put them on ice this very day! Squeeze those governments’ wallets until they demonstrate that they have made conditions safer for Christians.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We, of course, condemn all acts of terrorism, irrespective of who the perpetrators or victims are and of where they are carried out. However, our group’s members firmly believe in secular principles and a secular society. We therefore naturally condemn blasphemy. This means that we believe strongly in freedom of thought, freedom of conscience and freedom of religion, which includes the freedom to believe or not to believe, to choose one’s religion, change religion and to freely practise the religion of one’s choosing regardless of which religion that is.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It also means that we are firmly committed to the separation between religion and politics and we condemn the rise of fundamentalism in Europe and elsewhere, which is often a response to social unrest and the inability of public policy to address it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We believe that this resolution is a step in the wrong direction. To put it briefly, I would say that it lacks balance, especially in comparison with the motion tabled by my group. We feel this resolution gives the impression that Christian Europe, or the Christian community in Europe, is running to the aid of Christians throughout the world. We do not think this is the best way to combat the rise of these sectarian attitudes.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the joint resolution has rightly broached the issue of aggression against religious minorities in Europe itself. Exactly one month ago, a Jewish student in my country, the Netherlands, wrote the following: ‘I feel anxious, anxious about the paradox inherent in the protection of freedom of religion. If I have to leave tomorrow because there is no security here, where can I then live? The UK or France? No, the same problem exists there, as well’. My question is: is Europe heading towards a future with no Jewish communities in any of its Member States? This is an acid test of our European spiritual values.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That applies equally to the European attitude towards a well-nigh forgotten group of Christians in the Middle East, the Palestinian Christian minority in Gaza and the West Bank. They are entitled to expect concrete backing from the European Union, especially when Christian organisations take pains to provide a real home for disabled Palestinian children, regardless of their faith. Palestinian Christians face exceptional difficulties in the labour market, especially as self-employed entrepreneurs. They usually remain silent about their daily problems in order to avoid difficulties. Madam High Representative, let the Council and the Commission, as important donors to the Palestinian community, look after their interests and listen to their voices, as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to speak on a subject that is close to my heart. As an evangelical Christian, it has become apparent to me, particularly over recent years, that the expression of Christian beliefs is largely deemed unacceptable in a society that wants us sanitised of any strongly held belief and where we must all believe the same or believe nothing.</p>
      <p sl="en">This attack on conviction is more aggressive towards Christianity in certain quarters. This year, we celebrate the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible, yet today, to express beliefs founded upon the contents of the Bible is often deemed unlawful. We face a situation where Christians are being excluded from certain professions because of their faith and hauled before courts because of their faith. In the United Kingdom, equality laws are being used more as a sword than a shield, to punish expression of Christian faith.</p>
      <p sl="en">This marginalisation of Christianity was exemplified recently by the Commission in the publication of their diary: Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish and Chinese festivals were marked – yet there was nothing about Christian celebrations. I have no doubt that this was no accident, no oversight and I find it deeply regrettable. I would call upon the Vice-President/High Representative to address this in particular in her remarks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Freedom of religious expression is a fundamental right in society that should be protected and this debate is but a small recognition of the problem. We should not shy away from it just because it is Christians who are persecuted …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you very much for your statement. It is correct, it has been made at the right time and it is also encouraging with regard to the basic approach taken by you and your organisation to the problem as a whole, with regard to cooperation with other countries and with regard to the measures that are needed. This debate today is also necessary, not only as a result of recent events, but also because freedom of religion is one of our fundamental values and part of our European identity.</p>
      <p sl="de">This debate is important because discrimination, violence and persecution are taking place in many countries in the world and it is particularly worrying that a high proportion of all of those who die as a result of religiously motivated violence throughout the world are Christians. Our sympathy goes to all of those who have been killed, injured or tortured in attacks of this kind. Our sympathy also goes to their friends and families. We must do everything we can to reduce and even abolish this type of intolerance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, we are also seeing discrimination against Christians by official bodies and we must make every effort to combat and overcome it. We must make a commitment to ensuring the right to freedom of religion. This must lie at the heart of our bilateral relationships. We need effective instruments which will allow us to protect Christians and to protect freedom of religion. Therefore, I welcome the fact that ensuring the human right to freedom of religion will be one of the items on the agenda in every bilateral form of contact.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must also include provisions that guarantee freedom of religion in our agreements with third countries and I very much welcome your intention to devote a chapter of the European Union’s annual human rights report to the situation concerning freedom of religion.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to link the condemnation of these attacks and the call for urgent, concrete measures to protect Christians around the world with the more general demand for respect for the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience and thought.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no difference between someone who is murdered while attending mass and someone who is sentenced to death for adultery or for belonging to a Muslim, Christian or Jewish minority, or for having been born in a particular place rather than for practising a religion. The right to freedom and coexistence is universally recognised by humanist culture and international conventions. In contrast, we are seeing the world divided between those who uphold human rights and those who want to brutally extinguish them.</p>
      <p sl="it">Only an attitude open to dialogue and against any form of intolerance can provide a basis for protecting identities and values. A lack of respect for these can even lead to the expulsion of entire communities from their historical homelands. There is a great deal of work for Europe to do in this respect at a political and diplomatic level as well as in the cultural and social spheres. Today, we urge the Council and the Commission, and especially the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, to adopt clear guidelines for our relations with third countries in the context of the new European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="it">Bilateral agreements, too, must attach greater importance to the subjects of religious freedom and human rights more generally, violations of which should lead to the suspension of these agreements. I am also thinking that Europe should take a leading role in promoting dialogue between religions. A lack of such dialogue often goes beyond individual incidents and leads to real wars, in which religion conceals other, more complex reasons for conflict.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, we must also look closer to home: there is no lack of cases of intolerance in Europe. Our cities are, in practice, multicultural, and that fact brings with it religious traditions and values that must be respected and afforded freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is, therefore, no alternative to dialogue and mutual respect. It is important to repeat the appeal made by religious communities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the fate of Eastern Christians is changing the map of cultures, with communities thousands of years old – ‘Copt’ means ‘Egyptian’ in Greek – now looking to emigrate overseas to escape from the violence they have been suffering. However, the media or xenophobic parties should not make the mistake of calling this a clash of religions or a clash of civilisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to recount a short incident that I find significant. Years ago in Cairo, an old man from the countryside who delivered milk to our house three times a week stood at our door crying. We could not understand what he wanted, as all he could say through his tears was ‘Said Akbar , Said Akbar ,’ the great old man, the great old man. We eventually realised that he was showing his Christian customers his grief at the death of Karol Wojtyła, who had just passed away. This was a simple, sincere man, a Muslim who acted with all the ancient mutual respect of the Mediterranean peoples. This short but significant incident, reflecting widespread values in Egyptian society, happened in the same country in which the Copts were massacred at Christmas.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, however, Eastern Christian communities need protection. They are sometimes trapped in the settling of scores between terrorists and fundamentalists and authoritarian powers.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, tolerance of another’s belief is a trait of a civilised society. The horrific events in Egypt and Iraq go against human rights and basic principles of freedom of thought and expression. No one should be persecuted because of their religious beliefs. The action of curtailing Christians, or any other faith, in the practice of their religion is totally unacceptable in our society.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, before we criticise, we should put our own house in order. Last month, the Christmas religious services were prohibited in the occupied village of Rizokarpaso in Cyprus. As we all know, the EU Member State of the Republic of Cyprus is, at present, and has been for 36 years, under part-occupation by Turkey. The action by the occupying Turkish army of entering a church, forcing the priest to terminate the service and forcing the people attending it to leave, is unacceptable. This incident is now being considered by the UN.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, as we talk about the situation in countries outside the EU, and about the freedom of Christians, I would like to remind this Chamber that we need to sort out our own house first.

      <p sl="nl">I wholeheartedly support the joint resolution, in the form which we now see it before us, not because I think that we should solely concern ourselves with Christians, but because Christians are currently having to deal with intolerance in an increasing number of countries.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the attacks that have recently taken place in Iraq and Egypt are evidence of two tragedies for Europe, albeit of a different nature. Firstly, it is a tragedy that the events themselves have taken place, due to their cruelty and the loss of human life.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, however, it is also a tragedy to see how too often they go unnoticed in our society. In many cases, the way in which we act means that these events are confined to the accident and crime reports in the media, as if they were something external rather than an attack against us. It is as if they were happening somewhere else when, in fact, these attacks are taking place at the heart of and against the core of our civilisation, our Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">The role of the European institutions is, fundamentally, to raise awareness regarding the seriousness, the significance and the scope of the attacks against Christians in these places. The European institutions should not only issue generic statements condemning these attacks, but should also promote action along two lines: firstly, ensuring that this tragedy is more present in our societies and our media, and secondly, ensuring that the European institutions are more present where the tragedy is taking place.</p>
      <p sl="es">With this objective and with these two lines of action, allow me to say, Baroness Ashton, that the European institutions and you yourself must promote the important role of the victims of these events. The victims need to be given faces. The victims need to be present in our European institutions. We need to prepare a programme of visits, meetings and even material support for the victims, but it is the victims of this terrible persecution themselves who will do much better than we can to defend their cause.</p>

      <p sl="el">However, I should like, due to my origins, to comment on a specific incident which happened in Cyprus and which is referred to in the report. The Turkish occupying forces intervened in a church at which Christian services have been held for decades, in order to stop the service and, more importantly, to expel the congregation and force the priest to remove his vestments.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the barbaric massacre in Alexandria on 31 December comes on top of a long series of murderous attacks against Christians in many parts of the world: in Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Nigeria, and most recently Egypt. The main victims of the persecution – we should dare to say the word even though it does not appear in our resolution – have been Eastern Christians. This is a deep-seated problem and Christophobic acts are a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The remedy that the European Union must provide – that we must provide – must do justice to these Christian minorities. These are 12 million people who are in need of protection and who must be given a choice other than to flee or to face death. As has already been reiterated several times, it is not a matter of stigmatising one religion more than another, but simply of pointing out how absolutely vital it is to combat these Islamic extremists who are destroying freedom just as they are killing people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We hope, Baroness Ashton, that during the foreign ministers’ meeting at the end of this month, you will come up with a coordinated response and strategy to combat this violence against Eastern Christians. I think it is important to bring pressure to bear via the association agreements we have with some of these countries, for example, and to call on their respective governments to pursue the perpetrators and bring them to justice.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the victims of at least 75% of all cases of religious persecution throughout the world are Christians. The European Union cannot be a passive bystander, and it cannot sit back and do nothing on this issue. Today’s debate serves not only to remind Europe that it must be involved in the global fight to ensure respect for the right to religious freedom, but also that we should all give joint consideration to what instruments the European Union can use to prevent the persecution of Christians in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What can we do? As I see it, the first thing we should do is to ensure that respect for religious freedom is one of the priorities of the European Union’s external policy. When signing agreements with other countries, it is important for us to ensure that they include provisions which prevent persecution on the grounds of religion in the country in question.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, we should consider setting up a European centre for monitoring religious persecution throughout the world, which would provide relevant information without delay and enable the European Union to respond quickly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly and finally, we should put an end to our policy of double standards. The European Union and Europe as a whole is opening itself up to immigrants from various countries around the world. We are allowing places of worship to be built for them, and allowing them to practise their own religions. At the same time, however, we seldom stand up for the rights of Christians in those very same countries, in the countries where possessing a Bible is often punished by many years in prison, and on many occasions even death, in countries where it would not just be hard to build a Christian place of worship, it would be simply impossible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, the time has come for us to take a tough, resolute and firm stand for the rights of Christians around the world. Today, the time has come for us to be vocal in our demands for Christians and followers of other religions to be free to practise their religion.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this debate is very necessary given the recent serious events that are affecting the religious freedom and even the lives of Christians. I am particularly referring to what has happened mainly in Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="es">Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out in great detail what it calls freedom of religion or religious freedom. Despite this, it is, unfortunately, a right that is little respected in some countries. We are now even seeing that those who profess the Christian faith can pay for it with their lives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Baroness Ashton, the European Union must robustly defend the right to religious freedom in general, clearly incorporating it into its external action and demanding respect, freedom and security for what is now the most persecuted religious group in the world, the Christian community. We must demand that all the governments concerned do what is necessary to prevent these attacks, and when that is not possible, to arrest and punish those responsible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, freedom is a symbol of European identity, and that includes religious freedom, which is part of the basic core of human rights. That freedom is also a path to peace, as Pope Benedict XVI said in his message on 1 January. I would also like to highlight the essential role of Christianity in shaping the European identity. It would therefore be a sad paradox if the European Union did not demand as firmly as possible that the world protect the most basic rights of Christians and did not help them where it could.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Parliament resolution sets out methods for better defending religious freedom in general and the freedom of Christians in particular. I welcome the fact that the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council is to give them close consideration, and – I am finishing now, Mr President – that the forthcoming European Council on 14 February is to give its opinion on these serious events, just as, for example, President Sarkozy very courageously did.</p>

These figures come from organisations monitoring the persecution of Christians, and they mean that Christians do, in fact, suffer most in terms of religious persecution, which is something that we should remember here in Parliament. The situation is particularly tense in a significant proportion of Islamic countries, where Christians are treated as second-class citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe can no longer tolerate this situation, and not only because of its Christian roots. Innocent people are dying merely because they are followers of one religion and not another. The European Union does not react resolutely enough to attacks and discrimination against Christians. The persecution of Christians must be raised in bilateral negotiations and relations between the European Union and the countries in which such extreme and terrible events occur. Parliament should also require Mrs Ashton to be more proactive and resolute in her actions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I very much appreciate this debate and fully support the resolution, which I also sponsor. I believe there is a sleeping giant that is awakening because of the gratuitous and vicious abuse of Christians. If this viciousness and abuse applied to Muslims or the Jewish community, I would be equally concerned. Europe is a mosaic: its unity and diversity are our motto.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet in Cyprus, the Turkish Government and its representatives think it appropriate to require Christians to apply for permission to pray and turn them out of church when they decide to do this collectively. Has the Turkish representative to the European Union been called in? If not, why not? I would like to pay tribute to those Muslims who supported their Christian neighbours who were under attack. So let us not make this a motion against anybody. It is for Christians and for those who are being attacked.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not support and cannot accept abuse of people, individuals or communities because of their religious beliefs. This debate is about Christians; too many expect Christians to accept any old comments. They think it an anachronism. It is time we started to have mutual respect. I respect people in this House who have no religious belief or who have a different religious belief to me. It is time people in this House started to show respect for those who have Christian beliefs; it is in diversity that we have unity.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the number of cases of religious violence has multiplied recently throughout the world, causing concern and indignation. Banning the exercise of religious faith is a blatant infringement of fundamental rights and of international law, which stipulates that the right to faith is inalienable and self-evident.</p>
      <p sl="el">The ban on the Christian service in Rizokarpaso in occupied Cyprus by the occupying forces and the bombing in the Christian church in Alexandria used by the Coptic community are just two examples of the increased tension and religious hatred which are developing in numerous places not far from Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union must develop a set of tools which will protect the right of every religious faith in practice. The message that the European Union will not tolerate such behaviour must be clear and strong. I should like to call on the High Representative to include an evaluation of the situation of freedom of religious expression in her priorities. Finally, at Council and European Commission level, it would be a good idea to include protection of religious faith in all discussions with third countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Christianity has always been an indicator of European identity, and the European Union’s values derive from it. The EU cannot, therefore, sit back and watch while Christians are being persecuted, and this includes persecution in other parts of the world. In Arab and Asian countries, Christians are the religious minority most under threat, as is confirmed by the recent attacks on Christians in Egypt and Iraq and previous attacks in India, among the victims of which were small children. We have many instruments at our disposal to prevent and denounce such attacks, and the European Union must resolutely condemn attacks on Christians. One of the most effective ways to do this would be for the conclusion of agreements with the EU, for example, trade agreements with third countries, to be made conditional upon guarantees that the countries involved will respect the rights of Christians, and upon the inclusion of clauses providing for the severance of the agreement if these rights are violated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in 2009, we encouraged an intercultural dialogue in Europe, between Christians and Muslims, Orthodox Christians and Catholics and between Protestants and Orthodox Christians. In our community, we have attempted to bring about the growth of trust. We are doing this among ourselves. Of course, this means that we have our own views and the courage to express them. Sometimes, this is obviously not the case. I have recently read and heard that the European Commission has published a calendar for young people which includes the public holidays of all other religions except Christianity. All I can say is that things like this will only encourage those people in Egypt and elsewhere to continue committing horrific acts.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have an obligation to help Christians in those countries that have already been mentioned several times. The majority of them live in countries such as Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and Iran, which are the birthplace of Christianity. We must not allow these people to be driven out of their homes. They are not minorities, they are Egyptians and Palestinians, just like all the other residents of these countries. They want to continue living there, but this is being made difficult for them. We must support Baroness Ashton and we must attempt to ensure that the European Union includes a guarantee of religious freedom in all the treaties which it concludes with third countries and, in particular, with the countries we have referred to. We must make sure that no one is forced to leave their country for religious reasons.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, when I look at the situation in Baghdad and Alexandria, I get the feeling that we have gone back in time 500 years. Back then, we in the Netherlands were in the midst of the Hook and Cod Wars, during which Protestants and Catholics fought each other hammer and tongs. Mr President, there is no longer any place for that kind of thing in modern European society. When I look at Baghdad and Alexandria, however, I see that they are merely gross expressions of a life that exists under the surface in many countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For that reason, my message to you is that, in the framework of both that cultural dialogue and the freedoms which we have laid down together, the European Union needs to ensure the paramount importance of freedom of religion in every treaty it adopts, in every country it does business with and in every report it drafts, as I, indeed, pointed out in the report on Turkey. That also means – although Mrs Pack has not mentioned that – that these freedoms must be reciprocal and that freedom of religion must also be respected in countries where Islam is not the majority religion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I think that the intolerance and violence that have taken place are unacceptable and that we should engage the warring factions in dialogue. I therefore call on Madam Ashton, together with her diplomatic service, to ensure that we are absolutely consistent in discussing freedom of religion in every communication we have with the authorities of all those countries. You can count on the solidarity of Parliament in that regard.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Turkey, Pakistan. These countries have been home to them – to Christians – for centuries, and they have no wish to leave. It is appalling for Islamic clerics to promote anti-Christian sentiments in speeches to their believers. In northern Iraq, people are afraid to adorn their homes. In Baghdad, armed individuals burst in, shooting 52 people and wounding 200.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In December, we had the chance to meet the Iraqi bishops who were visiting the European Parliament.

Where have we got to with this?</p>
      <p sl="sk">In this context, I would like to mention Turkey, which is making major efforts for European integration, while, at the same time, prohibiting the establishment of Christian religious societies or congregations.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, I do not in any way want to undervalue the pressure on other religions, but the statistics speak for themselves: 75% of those threatened or killed for religious reasons are Christians, and around 100 million Christians around the world encounter persecution and violence because of their faith.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Recently, the situation has become particularly worrying in the Middle East, as we have heard here. Attacks on church services in Iraq, Egypt and Syria have claimed dozens of lives, including those of children. Elsewhere in the world, too, there are challenges. Dramatic economic growth in Asian countries conceals serious breaches of fundamental and human rights. In China, India and Vietnam, for example, freedom of religion is mainly only recognised on paper. We have to acknowledge that the EU and its Member States are closing their eyes to this, on account of trade relations, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Nevertheless, if it wanted to, the EU could do so much more to improve the situation for Christians and to promote freedom of religion in the world, for example, by insisting on a freedom of religion clause in all agreements concluded with third countries. For that reason, I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether the intention in future is to insist on such a clause and, furthermore, monitor its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Europe’s faint-hearted attitude is partly due to the fact that we ourselves are losing our old values here. We want to isolate religion in a private space. This is reflected, for example, in the crucifix debate that took place in Italy. In the same way, Mrs Pack mentioned here the calendar published by the Commission, from which Christian religious holidays have been omitted entirely. Secularism is not the answer to these problems. The answer lies in a respect for those with views other than our own and for the convictions of others.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the plight of Christians in the Middle East, Asia and Africa is no accident. This is not a series of regrettable but uncoordinated attacks. On the contrary, it is classic mass persecution. The Christians are intimidated, evicted or killed with a clear purpose: religious cleansing. This is happening as we here in Europe are bending over backwards to accommodate the endless sensibilities of Muslim believers. The result is a Europe full of mosques and the Middle East purged of Christians.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this is not about numbers. It is about liberty and identity. Even for those among us who do not believe, Christianity should be more than a forgotten, exotic and diminishing sect. We are free to believe or not, but we are not free to see our freedoms abused.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to say to the High Representative that in this situation, condemnations and statements are not enough. Attacks on Christian communities have dramatically intensified, especially in the countries of the Middle East and North Africa. It is difficult to find a state there where Christians can live as a normal minority and, most importantly, freely proclaim their faith.</p>
      <p sl="en">People who have newly adopted Christianity are exposed to the risk of death. We do not speak about new minorities there. Christians are among ancient traditional inhabitants in these countries. Nowadays, they increasingly are forced to leave their countries, are forced into ghettos, or have become internal refugees like those in Iraq. Therefore, it is a pressing task to formulate the EU strategy on religious freedom and to earmark a set of concrete measures against those states which deliberately fail to protect religious minorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like also to mention the idea of a colleague, Mr Mayor Oreja, which is to compose a list of victims with whom the EU external services should actively make contact. This is not opposing one religion against another.

My question is this: if Europe, as the cradle of Christianity, fails to defend Christians and their freedom to practise their religion, then who will?</p>
      <p sl="mt">However, we must also try to prevent Muslim communities from being radicalised and manipulated by extremists. We must also be careful not to label all Muslims as terrorists, because those who favour violence and extremism are in the minority. At the same time, Muslim communities worldwide are duty-bound to condemn extremists who are taking advantage of their religion and should disassociate themselves from these people, so as to prevent them from giving the Muslim religion a bad name.</p>
      <p sl="mt">In addition, we must urge the authorities of these countries with all our might to protect Christian communities from persecution.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Above all, despite the events which are unfolding before our eyes and which instil a sense of anger, we cannot forgo all sense of reason. As Mahatma Gandhi said, ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth will leave us all blind and toothless’.</p>

      <p sl="it">Therefore, as this is the last speech scheduled, I should like to add something that has not yet been said, and what comes to mind are the thoughts of a very great European, John Paul II, a man who very effectively helped to bring down the Berlin Wall. In his spiritual testament, he mentions the four values that underpin our future civilisation, that is to say, the civilisation of love: they are life, peace, bread and religious freedom.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then I think of everything that has been written by Giorgio La Pira, the former Mayor of Florence, who promoted large conferences on Christian civilisation at the height of the cold war. In his book Premesse della politica (‘Premises of politics’), he wrote that every political idea has a particular concept of man underlying it. For Christian Europe, he writes, man is essentially a praying being, that is to say, a being able to enter a dialogue, to conceive of the infinite and to talk to God.</p>
      <p sl="it">Taking away a man’s ability to take part in private and public dialogue is not only a negation of religion, but also a negation of man himself. I leave these thoughts with the House and with you, High Representative, as a contribution towards a concrete and effective commitment by our European Union, which is rooted in its Christian identity and never fails to proclaim its purpose of defending and promoting human dignity and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, today we are discussing a motion for a resolution on the situation of Christians throughout the world in relation to freedom of religion. The European Parliament supports fundamental freedoms and human rights all over the world. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is one of the driving forces behind this support and this distinguishes us from the conservatives who are focusing specifically on the situation of Christians.</p>
      <p sl="de">In general terms, this is not just about the position of Christians. From a liberal perspective, this concerns freedom of religion as a whole. By this I mean all the religions throughout our entire world. It is about protection for religious minorities and the obligation of every state to protect to the best of its ability the members of those religious minorities which are under threat.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also have problems in Europe. I come from Berlin, and there alone, we have had six arson attacks against mosques within the space of six months, fortunately not resulting in any deaths, following the uproar sparked by a social-democratic former central banker. However, the German state is attempting to provide the best possible protection for religious buildings. In the same way, Egypt is also increasing the measures it is taking following the second major terrorist attack against Christians.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we cannot have a policeman standing in front of every church, mosque or synagogue. I very much regret the fact that in many countries, including my own, Jewish buildings have come to look like high-security institutions. For this reason, it is important that we as politicians take responsibility for the attitude to religious minorities in our countries and that we promote an open, friendly approach to all religions.</p>

      <p sl="en">So I am delighted today that even some of the more aggressive and anti-clerical forces in this House have woken up to the existential threat to ancient Christian faith communities such as the Iraqi Assyrians, of which I am a patron in the UK, and the Egyptian Copts.

This is precisely the problem of our communities today. Everyone is talking – and mostly about ideas – but we only listen to what we ourselves are saying. This includes the problem of the outbreak of Islamic fundamentalism which has occurred in recent days and which occurred in Egypt in the savage attacks around the New Year.</p>

      <p sl="en">As I have already indicated, part of the reason I was very pleased to be able to participate in this debate is that this has been raised once before with the Foreign Affairs Council – but we will come back to it at the end of January – and the concerns that honourable Members have made have resonated and echoed with the concerns which have been raised with me from a variety of different sources, not least from some of the Member States and some of the ministers who have been most concerned about these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to make it clear that I did, in fact, talk about Christianity. I began by expressing the reasons I had for specifically going to Bethlehem, and that was to recognise that although I was in the Middle East, I was also in the heart, in a sense, of many religions – specifically on the eve of the Orthodox Christmas. That was a very powerful statement in itself and it was a very personal and deliberate act to do that. I know that, unfortunately, Mr Mauro is no longer in his place to hear my reply, but I hope that he is told that I did in my words indeed mention that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to just pick up two or three things. A number of honourable Members have raised the question of how we use the tools that are available to us to ensure that these issues can be addressed. I want to remind honourable Members that almost all of the trade and cooperation agreements which we have concluded since 1995 have included a human rights clause, and that exists in agreements with, I believe now, 134 countries.</p>

Honourable Members will remember that in my previous capacity, it was I who raised the issue of ‘GSP plus’ and Sri Lanka. You will know that we have taken steps to suspend them from that scheme, specifically on the grounds of issues of human rights. It is very important, as honourable Members have said, that we continue to look at the way in which we conclude agreements and the tools at our disposal to do that and to make sure that those levers are pulled if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things that I think will be very interesting as the Commission begins to look at the future of the GSP regulation is to see whether aspects of that regulation that concern the ratification and implementation of human rights and conventions could be improved.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wanted to put the other side of that, which is, of course, the instruments that we use to promote and support democracy in human rights. We are, as honourable Members know, supporting projects worldwide in the fight against racism, xenophobia or discrimination on any ground. We have funded anti-discrimination NGOs in some 60 countries. Therefore, we strike a balance between using the tools at our disposal to ensure that we are able to demonstrate when we feel very strongly that this has been violated, and using those tools – combined with the willingness that we have and the availability that we have – to support those NGOs, in particular, those that are active in the field of anti-discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wanted also to just touch on one other area, and that is the role of the delegations across the world and the role of monitoring what is happening. A number of honourable Members indeed raised this as a particular point. I have already said that I think it is really important that we monitor the issues across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was particularly struck by one issue that honourable Members talked about in a number of contributions and what, in a sense, has become very much more recognised in recent weeks and months but which nonetheless has been a concern to many honourable Members for a very long time: the concern about the way in which religious people, of all kinds of religion, are treated or discriminated against on a regular basis across the world and our need to be mindful and watchful of those issues, not when they become violent – when they become violent, in a sense, we are, of course, bound to act – but before they become violent, too, when this is a regular source of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is important that we see our delegations across the world as a source of being able to see and recognise the kind of discrimination that honourable Members feel ‘bubbles below the surface’, if I can use that expression, and notify us when they see it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think it is important, as I have indicated that we put forward at the last Foreign Affairs Council, that in our human rights work and in the report that we produced, we are also addressing the situation of religious minorities across the world. Christianity has played a very important part in our discussions today but many honourable Members have pointed out that this also needs to apply in ensuring that we have respect and tolerance for other faiths in everything that we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it will be important to try and get a sense of what is really happening both through our monitoring in our reports and also through our delegations across the world. That I think will give us a greater sense of knowing how then to use the instruments that are available to us, particularly from the Commission side; but also a sense of the political will, not just from me, but – as you have rightly pointed out – as parliamentarians you have a strong voice and a strong role in this, together with the Member States and the ministers involved in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I began, I said that I am committed to trying to make sure that we use what we have better, that we monitor carefully what is happening and that we use the political and economic instruments at our disposal to keep this at the heart of our agenda for the future, and I am very grateful for all the contributions. To those whose comments and questions I have not answered: it is not lack of will, I will consider them very carefully, and all of this will feed into the debate that we will have at the Foreign Affairs Council at the end of January.</p>

We citizens of the European Union support and promote religious freedom and have a duty to emphasise that this must be respected, protected and promoted as one of the basic human rights. Indeed, the aim of terrorism, in this whole context, is to cause uproar and conflicts through attacks which the perpetrators try to justify by referring to an underlying religious motive. I would like to stress that terrorism does not have any type of religion. This is precisely the reason why any kind of fundamentalist thinking must be left at the door of mosques, churches and synagogues. The world’s religions do not encourage violent attacks. Indeed, the people who participate in such attacks should not believe that they are fighting for something. Quite the opposite. I believe that they are fighting against morality, fellow human beings and humanity itself.</p>

      <p sl="en">The persecution of Christians in Islamic countries, and some non-Islamic countries such as communist China, is a growing and despicable trend. One of the most recent outbursts of anti-Christian violence was in Alexandria at New Year when 25 people were killed and 80 injured in the bombing of a church. The background to this attack has been highlighted to me by the Coptic community in London and elsewhere in the UK. They estimate that there were more than 100 attacks on Christians in Egypt last year, in which many were killed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those responsible are motivated by fundamentalist and extremist Islamist ideology. I and the UK Independence Party, which I represent, do not want an EU foreign policy or an EU foreign minister – currently in the form of Baroness Ashton. However, since the Baroness is in this position, she should take account of the fact that the EU signs deals worth billions of euro with countries that are among the worst persecutors of Christians. The EU should use its economic muscle to insist it will not give preferential deals or favourable treatment to those countries that tolerate the persecution of Christians. This is the very least it should be expected to do.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Statistics on religious freedom show that the majority of acts of religious violence have been against Christians in recent years. In 2010, the number of attacks on Christian communities rose worryingly. Unfortunately, many lost lives need to be mourned, resulting from the bloody attacks on the Christian communities in Nigeria and Pakistan, the terrorist attacks against Coptic Christians in Alexandria and the Philippines, the jihadi terrorist attacks against Assyrian Christian families, and the coordinated bomb attacks on Christian homes in Baghdad. Moreover, I repudiate the deplorable persecution of Christians by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the reprehensible repression of the activities of the Catholic Church and other religious communities in Vietnam. The European Union must renew the commitment it has always shown to the pursuit of religious freedom, freedom of conscience and freedom of thought, which are fundamental principles of the acquis communautaire . Governments have a duty to guarantee these freedoms. Therefore, and given the increase in anti-Christian violence worldwide, I would argue that the Council, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy should take rapid, robust and energetic action to guarantee the defence of religious freedom in the world.</p>

      <p sl="pl">All is most definitely not well when it comes to respect for the rights of Christians to follow their own religion. Last year alone, the European Parliament had to respond to violations of Christians’ human rights exceptionally often. I have been the co-author of three resolutions on related subjects – one on Iraq, in particular, the death penalty (including the case of Tariq Aziz) and attacks against Christian communities, adopted on 24 November 2010, one on recent attacks on Christian communities, adopted on 20 January 2010, and one on religious freedom in Pakistan, adopted on 19 May 2010.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This year’s events in Alexandria are a reminder of the fact that the European Parliament called on the Egyptian Government a year ago to guarantee the Coptic Christians and the members of other religious communities and minorities the ability to exercise all human rights and fundamental freedoms – including the right to choose and change religion freely – and to prevent any discrimination against such groups. Meanwhile, tomorrow, we will hold another debate on the freedom of Christians in Pakistan. The statistical method is not ideal, but sometimes it allows us to make a better assessment of the scale of a problem. Deutsche Welle journalists have done some interesting calculations regarding violations of Christians’ rights; they have calculated that, on average, a Christian martyr dies every three minutes somewhere in the world as a result of his or her beliefs. It is truly shocking that such a thing is happening literally before our eyes.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As Europeans, we try to ensure that everyone in Europe can freely practise the religion which allows them to follow their heart and conscience. We also adopt legal regulations which protect citizens from discrimination on the grounds of religious faith. We teach tolerance and equal rights in schools, and we allow immigrants to make free use of their religious symbols. It so happens that we are doing this at the expense of Europe’s majority religion. Our tradition and civilisation draws most extensively of all on its Christian roots, and there are more Christians among us than adherents of any other religion. I say this also as a representative of a political group which includes the phrase ‘Christian Democrats’ in its title. We have no influence over how Christians are treated in many countries of the world. However, we can and should ensure freedom of religion for all Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="it">The problem becomes a political one, however, when religious differences are used as a means to prevent growth and development. The hatred fostered by these terrorist attacks is designed precisely to destabilise the social and political system in the countries where the violence occurs. Given the European Union’s role of promoting respect for human rights and for civil and democratic freedoms and, above all, given its Christian origins and roots, it has a duty in all this to react firmly by condemning all forms of extremism and promoting dialogue, religious freedom, mutual respect among communities, and tolerance.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Christians are currently persecuted in over 70 countries around the world. This means that the fundamental human right to religious freedom is violated in every third country. The European Union has started to realise that persecution on religious grounds is a serious violation of human dignity and freedom. The debate on religious freedoms and the situation of Christians, which has been going on in Parliament for several months now, is also significant in formal terms, since the Treaty of Lisbon strengthened the position of churches in European debate, and they now have the right to be official partners in dialogue with the European Commission. The European Parliament, which acts as a guardian of human rights, should find ways to defend freedom of religion around the world as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Bearing in mind the recent violence against Christian minorities in certain Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries, I believe that it would be a good idea to raise this issue at the forthcoming EU Foreign Affairs Council and, together with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to draft specific instruments to protect the Christian community. The European Parliament should call on countries where persecution takes place to take effective steps to protect religious minorities, despite the difficulties involved in doing so. We should therefore also start to take the matter of religious freedom seriously when the EU signs agreements on cooperation with third countries.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on an oral question to the Vice-President of the Commission, the Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, by Arnaud Danjean, Ioannis Kasoulides, Elmar Brok, José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, Michael Gahler, Krzysztof Lisek and Andrey Kovatchev, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), concerning the security situation in the Sahel region (O-0180/2010 – B7-0808/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-486-000" speaker_id="96747" name="Arnaud Danjean" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the subject we are dealing with today is one that we ought to have begun looking at many months ago, given that the security situation in the Sahel region has been steadily deteriorating for over three years now. Furthermore, we are dealing with the subject in a week in which we in France have buried two innocent young victims of Islamic terrorism, who were killed on the Niger-Mali border a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Aside from the intense feelings that these crimes arouse, we need to recognise the real threats concentrated in this region on Europe’s doorstep, as the threat is not only from terrorism, even though the kidnappings and murders are the most dramatic manifestation of the deteriorating situation in Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Criminal networks are rife. Trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings is threatening the stability of these countries, but also that of our own continent. For make no mistake, in the same way that the majority of the victims of the terrorist acts in this region are European citizens, Europe is also the destination for this trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the face of this extremely worrying situation, the European Union should put in place an integrated, comprehensive strategy to combine its development and security policies. This is absolutely vital. There are initiatives already in place of course, via the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) in particular, and almost EUR 2 billion have been set aside for these countries for combating poverty, developing the economy and establishing more effective governance. Certain Member States have bilateral cooperation policies, too, of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we now need to go much further. In particular, our action needs to be much more coordinated. We need to strengthen the regional approach and encourage these countries to work together more to deal with the common challenges they face. We also need to expand the range of policies at the EU’s disposal and integrate them as much as possible, in the areas of development, security, strengthening institutional structures, customs, the courts and the police.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, there are few regions so close to Europe that harbour so many threats to our security and there are few regions in which the EU can at last put into practice the integrated approach envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon, on the basis of which the European External Action Service which you currently head was formed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, please can you give us some details about the strategy that you intend to implement in this region?</p>

    <intervention id="3-487-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Catherine Ashton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to begin as Mr Danjean did, with the terrible news of the death of two young Frenchmen who were kidnapped 10 days ago in Niger’s capital, Niamey, and killed only a few hours later. We have condemned what is a truly appalling crime and I reiterate our condolences to their families, as well as to those of Niger’s officers who were killed during the ensuing shooting. I want to express solidarity with the French authorities and the authorities of Niger.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, another five French citizens are still being held hostage somewhere in the desert of northern Mali by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. In the last year alone, 10 European citizens were kidnapped and four were killed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The security situation in the Sahel is alarming: organised crime networks, weak state presence in the desert zones and low capacity of security sectors in addition to widespread poverty, drought and food shortages. These threats pose a serious challenge to development work and prospects, as it has become too risky for those engaged in development to continue their operations in this environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and its Member States have been contributing for several years to tackling the development and the security problems in individual Sahel countries, but threats to security transcend national borders and the only possible, the only effective response is a regional and comprehensive one. We need to make the ongoing European engagement in the Sahel more coherent, more coordinated and more effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last October, the Foreign Affairs Council gave me the task of preparing, in association with the Commission, a strategy for the Sahel for the beginning of this year. This strategy was to be based on a holistic and integrated approach, making use of the various instruments at our disposal in a coherent way, so we can foster security, stability, development and good governance in Sahel.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that, in order to respond to the complexity of the challenges of the Sahel, we have to act at various different levels. Firstly, we need a political and diplomatic dimension. That is necessary to ensure that we facilitate dialogue between the Sahel countries, which continue to harbour mutual distrust. We should build on the national strategies that we have – where they exist – and encourage the setting up of regional initiatives and tools to jointly address security threats.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel, the EU should reinforce the dialogue on security in the Sahel with the Maghreb countries, regional organisations – the African Union, ECOWAS and CEN-SAD – and also the international community at large, and the United Nations, the United States and Canada in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need to assist the Sahel countries in enhancing the capabilities of the security sectors – army, police, justice and border control systems – in each country. They must be able to effectively re-establish the rule of law and security and redeploy state authority in the most sensitive regions. We will encourage regional cooperation between Mali, Mauritania and Niger at an operational level so they can jointly and more effectively face the threat of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, organised crime and domestic banditry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, in the longer term, the EU should continue to contribute to the development of the Sahel countries in order to help them increase their capabilities to provide social services and development to the population. Individual countries will continue to promote internal stability and help find both socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, in order to prevent and fight against extremism and radicalisation, we need to support states and legitimate non-state actors in designing and implementing strategies and activities, with the aim of fighting Islamic radicalisation and promoting democratic, tolerant and non-violent visions for society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our endeavour will be to use, in a coherent manner, the short-term and long-term instruments that we have in order to implement the different components of this strategy. Member States’ engagement to build into the strategy will, of course, be part of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am working very closely with Commissioner Piebalgs, whose involvement in the preparation of the security and development strategy is essential, to ensure the necessary resources for its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that if we set up this new comprehensive and holistic strategy, continuing the political, diplomatic and operational development strands of our engagement in the Sahel, we will give a new impetus to tackling the multiple threats and challenges that this region faces. I am looking forward to presenting this strategy properly in a few weeks’ time and involving the honourable Members of the European Parliament in discussion.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled, in the last three years, we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting European Union interests and citizens in the southern Sahara, which has become a haven for the Islamic branch of al-Qaeda, with a whole string of murders, kidnappings, extortion, blackmail, drug trafficking and people trafficking, the victims of which have been German, Italian, Spanish and, most recently, French citizens. We therefore want to express our solidarity with our French fellow Members, and say, Baroness Ashton, that this situation demands a firm, unflinching response from the European Union, as President Sarkozy has demanded.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this context, this response needs to be made in the political, economic and development spheres, and Mr Danjean reminded us of the huge resources in the European Development Fund.</p>
      <p sl="es">Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the G8 anti-terrorism summit in October – when you received the Council mandate – in Mali, which Algeria did not attend. You said that the response needs to be a regional one. I think it is a bad sign that two of the parties in this conflict – such as Morocco and Algeria – are not cooperating with each other, on top of the unstable situation in Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the anti-terrorist centre created by Algeria 2 000 km south of Algiers, in which Mali, Mauritania and Niger are participating, and to tell me if you share the interpretation that the aim of this anti-terrorist centre is to prevent the European Union and the United States from being present in order to guarantee security in the area.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be positive agreement between Mr Danjean’s remarks and what you said in your speech, Baroness Ashton, regarding the analysis of the situation, which is that the situation in the Sahel is critical.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are talking about one of the poorest regions in the world, bordering on some of the countries that have been shaken over the last week by more dangerous instability than ever. It is also a region where terrorist infiltration and drug trafficking are intertwined to a truly worrying extent. All that makes the situation unsustainable and a real threat to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need to see a qualitative leap in Europe’s initiative. The 2009 initiative for security and development in the Sahel has so far proved ineffective. What is needed is the new strategy for security in the Sahel that the Council of Foreign Ministers have called to adopt, which we are awaiting. I believe there are two important points that have been highlighted: firstly, a regional approach; and secondly, an integrated approach that enables us to make the best possible use of the various instruments available to the EU in a concrete, operational and coordinated way. We must realise, however, that the path for a possible mission must be assessed very carefully, because Common Security and Defence Policy missions are one of the instruments we have available, but they are no replacement for a political strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our group therefore fully endorses Europe’s new, renewed commitment in the Sahel and we are anxious to see the new strategy, discuss it in detail and support its implementation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there has been an alarming increase in the Sahel region of the type of incidents mentioned in the oral question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The people most affected by the activities of the criminal networks and terrorists are expatriates, many of whom have behaved in an exemplary way, as did the two French nationals whose tragic fate we condemn. At the same time, each incident further undermines the authority of the respective governments, who are attempting to tackle their economic, security and political cooperation problems within a regional system whose institutional framework, let us not forget, is broadly based on the European model. The issues raised in this discussion are extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want to do what is expected of us as the European Union, in the first instance, we must agree on a common approach to the Sahel region in particular and to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in general.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we must look seriously at both the immediate and the underlying causes behind the deteriorating situation in this region. One of these underlying causes is the extreme poverty of these States, which are therefore weak and unable to fulfil their sovereign functions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, we need to define a clear EU strategy on this subject, and I would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her announcement on this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly, we must not skimp on the resources needed to help the States in question regain control of the situation, especially the security situation. I would like to finish by pointing out that in tackling the problems raised in Mr Danjean’s question, we are, in fact, taking care of our own security.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, what is this all about? Is it about organised crime or about political and/or religious terrorism? This is an important question when it comes to assessing the situation. Experts on this region are of the opinion that this is more to do with crime than with religiously motivated international terrorism. Measures against terrorism often have fatal consequences for peace and democracy and can be used as a pretext for promoting other interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">It may be that this is also about Africa as one of the areas in which Europe is interested. In the words of Gilles de Kerchove, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, it concerns Africa as Europe’s backyard. I am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise Africa. The Sahel region can only be made secure by improving the situation of the population. Increasing security and military budgets in countries where the population is suffering from an acute food shortage is a disastrous move.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like you to consider the fact that kidnapping and other crimes are a business in which many people are involved in a confusing array of organisations. Western funding for security structures could have a counterproductive effect on efforts to combat crime and could continue putting innocent people at risk in future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Antoine de Lecour and Vincent Delory in Niger give us a painful reminder of the need to implement a strategy for promoting security, stability and good governance in the Sahel region. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has actually supported such a strategy for a long time and I would like to welcome, in this context, the European Commission’s announcement to the effect that a strategy which will combine security and development aspects will be presented by the end of this month.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I truly believe that we need to look at the security issue in the Sahel from every aspect because, if terrorism has managed to take root in this region, the reason is that it has found there political, mainly social and obviously economic conditions conducive to this development. We are dealing with extremely permeable borders and a lack of any effective government control. All these factors have obviously facilitated the spread of illegal trafficking. There are also development deficiencies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that there are two extremely useful factors to help ensure the security of the Sahel and, by extension, European citizens. Firstly, a strategy is required at Sahel-Sarahan level, aimed at restoring the authority of the states in the region over the abandoned territories as well as, obviously, at establishing the rule of law. Secondly, I believe that we need to launch joint socio-economic development programmes in the border areas so as to create job opportunities for the local populations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, requests to debate this topic have been made several times, and commitments have been adopted each time to put the required initiatives into practice in the Sahel region, whether to stabilise the region or to ensure greater security.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we know, given the lack of borders and the huge size of the region, the Sahel is an ideal area of transit for drug traffickers and terrorist groups, specifically al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The weakness and instability of the states in this region are the main problem and, as has been pointed out, the threats directly affect the peoples and countries in the region, particularly Mauritania, Mali and Niger.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main task the European Union has to address is to draw up a credible security strategy based on the various facets of possible European action: cooperation and development policy, regional programmes, coordination strategies for highway security, and security training policies. Hence, the European Union not just should, but must intervene as quickly as possible, and therefore we are looking forward to the Commission drawing up a complete strategy, as you announced, Baroness Ashton, as well as strong intervention on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, my request is clear: we need to pay far greater attention to what is happening south of Europe, because many things are about to change and we had better not be caught unprepared. It could only do the EU good to be more far-sighted.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the deterioration in the security situation in Sahel is extremely serious. It has cost many lives and is threatening to undermine the political progress that has been made in recent years in the fight against terrorism. Naturally, I would also like to extend my sympathy to all those who have been so badly affected by this horrific violence.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is particularly regrettable that the attacks by al-Qaeda are increasing in the Sahel region at a time when they are decreasing in many other parts of the world. An estimated 25% of the global cocaine trade to Europe from Latin America comes through the Sahel region every year. Drug smuggling enables terrorist activities to be funded by stable incomes and it also makes it possible to recruit young people in the region and pay them well.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This frightening development is also worrying our colleagues in the Sahel region and, at the most recent meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in December, we discussed precisely how the security situation in this region can be improved and the smuggling reduced. Baroness Ashton, the EU’s efforts here need to be very clear and they also need to be stepped up. Together with the countries in the Sahel strip, we must extend and coordinate our efforts by means of an overall regional strategy just like you mentioned. The EU has a huge joint responsibility here to provide high quality assistance with a definite strengthening of the democratic forces.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as you know, Niger, one of the central countries of the Sahel region, is holding presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of this month. I think that Baroness Ashton’s decision to send a European Union delegation to those elections is an important gesture of support, and I want to thank her for thinking of me to chair it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would first of all like to express my regret at the recent murder of two young French people in Niger at the hands of terrorists, not forgetting the Nigerien soldiers who died during the rescue operation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The population of the region clearly rejects violence and terrorism, as they are the first to suffer as a result, but they ask the European Union to do everything it can to help them to eradicate terrorist violence and, among other things, to provide weapons and training for their armed forces so that they can respond adequately to these terrorist incursions.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, despite having a great wealth of natural resources, Niger is one of the least developed countries in the world. The European Union must therefore work to establish an effective development cooperation strategy to help Niger and the whole region out of the difficult situation they are in. I think there is a great deal at stake for us in this area of the world, because it is not only its welfare, but that of Europe that is dependent on its stability, given its geographical proximity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, insecurity in the Sahel region requires development effort, as Commissioner Piebalgs said a few days ago. However, development, although essential and long lasting, is not enough on its own. As Baroness Ashton said today, the EU needs a coherent strategy that makes use of all available instruments, including those aimed at reforming the security sectors of the countries in the region and at democratic and institutional capacity building. The European Union has not acted in this way, though. We need only take a look nearby at Guinea-Bissau, today practically transformed into a narco-state, from where the European Union very recently withdrew a European Security and Defence Policy mission. That was wrong, because what was needed was to strengthen the size and mandate of this mission, especially since the centre of organised crime in Guinea-Bissau targets Europe directly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another example of how the European Union is not doing what it should in the Sahel is the way in which it has washed its hands of seeking a solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. If we continue to look the other way – particularly now with the highly charged events happening in Tunisia and the consequences for the entire region – we shall only aggravate the security situation in the Sahel and deliver another cornered, desperate generation to criminal and terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which are already at large in the region.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot continue not having this coherent strategy in place, as described by Baroness Ashton.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the Sahel is a pivotal region lying between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. The worrying level of insecurity there concerns us all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to draw your attention to the resolution adopted on 4 December last year by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which addresses precisely this subject, and to the recommendations this resolution makes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A common European strategy is obviously needed, but the European Union will not get anywhere if it is acting alone. This is why the actors present in the region need to engage in wide-reaching concerted action. A summit of the Heads of State of the countries in the region, organised under the auspices of the UN, the EU and the African Union, would be an opportunity to tackle the problem head on and to try to find solutions through a broad-based strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to demonstrate real political will, a two-stage action plan for the region is desperately needed. The first stage would deal with the immediate, urgent situation. This would involve the region’s states pooling the resources and information they have and coordinating their actions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second stage would involve raising the awareness of the local inhabitants about the problem and looking at prevention. It is important to prevent the ranks of terrorists from swelling day by day as a result of the frustration and lack of direction of the region’s inhabitants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union cannot stand by and do nothing to tackle this problem. I would therefore urge Baroness Ashton to do everything necessary in order to move the discussions on and to come up with concrete solutions to this major problem.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the deterioration in the security situation in the Sahel region is no longer a regional problem. Unfortunately, it has now become a European Union problem with the increase in the number of attacks where European citizens are the victims.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Sahel is facing, first and foremost, a terrorist threat, which is growing steadily and whose victims are mainly Europeans, who are being kidnapped and murdered with appalling frequency. This is also a transit region for drugs and arms smuggling, as well as a channel for illegal emigration to Europe. I believe that practical cooperation must be stepped up with the North African authorities to increase the involvement of the armed and security forces in the region in combating terrorism. Similarly, we have available a number of political instruments for boosting regional cooperation in order to counter this threat.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that the European Union’s technical assistance efforts will be focused, to a larger extent, on supporting the development process because we cannot overlook the fact that the terrorist groups find the Sahel a fertile ground for support, particularly due to the poverty among the population and the fragile state of government authority. I believe that increased, properly targeted development aid can play a key role in improving the situation in the region.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that the situation in the Sahel region has worsened considerably. A lawless zone allowed to develop on Europe’s doorstep is a threat that we should combat decisively and immediately. The number of extremist groups is increasing, and they are threatening the lives of civilians.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I, too, condemn the loss of human life and kidnappings and am concerned for European nationals in the region. Until now, Morocco has acted as a stronghold against the different forms of trafficking from the Sahel. However, drug, arms and human traffickers are now bypassing Morocco by going through Mauritania and the Canary Islands to reach the European Union. I see it as the EU’s responsibility to take action to help these States put an end to these threats.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe’s security is determined not only on our own territory but also in the regions nearest to us. The time has come to act, and I call on the Commission and the Council to implement an action plan that will help restore security in the Sahel region.</p>

      <p sl="en">This poses a vast security challenge on top of the similar problems we already face in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border region, in Somalia and in Yemen. The EU must now cooperate strongly with our US allies and other democratic countries such as India and Israel, as well as neighbouring moderate Arab and African governments, in finding a joint strategy to defeat this menace to global security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam High Representative, Operation Atalanta, off Somalia, has been a success. Perhaps something now needs to be considered – under a NATO hat, a French-led Common Security and Defence Policy mission, or whatever – to defeat this global threat, particularly in the region of Mali, Mauritania and Niger, which are already extremely poor countries and need every bit of help we can give them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be quite brief because honourable Members have been very helpful in offering not only support for the breadth of the approach that we will be taking but also raising particular issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I pick up two of them, the first is – and, in a sense, Mrs Salafranca began with it – about how we should support regional initiatives, which are often dominated by individual countries but do not include all the members of the region, and how best to try and provide the kind of support that ensures we engage with all the countries of that region. I am putting it slightly more broadly than the honourable Member did, but very deliberately so. One of the challenges for us is to back initiatives that countries are able to take individually and collectively, but ensure that they can be effective by ensuring that they are comprehensive, either in terms of the numbers of countries or in the approach that they take.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things we need to look at is how to balance our own actions against supporting actions from those most concerned. I am always very conscious of looking at ways in which we intervene, through our support and through the instruments at our disposal, to back up and support initiatives on the ground – home-grown initiatives – as being often but not always the best way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the Western Sahara and the proposals being made, these are things we need to look at. I need to see where best we can lend support. I am conscious in a number of discussions with honourable Members that these issues, particularly Western Sahara, have become more prominent. We need to think about this approach in a very comprehensive way. We will continue to work on this. It will be part of the discussions that we have at the Foreign Affairs Council, but also something that we will return to with the Parliament to make sure that we have got it right.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is now really important that we move forward into a strategy that really does consider the short, medium and long term but also the breadth of the way in which we can engage as a European Union, as a Parliament, as a Commission and as a series of Member States able to pack this up into one seriously thought-through strategy for the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the events which followed the elections in Belarus on 19 December have come as a shock to all of us: the force used by the authorities against their citizens prompted statements of concern and condemnation across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">My colleagues and I have met with many of those affected, among the opposition movement, civil society, the families of those imprisoned and the population at large. We have had the opportunity to express our sympathy and solidarity and to listen. However, honourable Members, the time has come to act.</p>
      <p sl="en">I greatly appreciate the fact that Members of this Parliament have already been able to contribute to our reflections on this issue and that my colleague, Commissioner Füle, was able to present our current thinking to the AFET Committee last week. I am looking forward to studying the EU resolution which emerges from your debates. It is important for all of us to be as focused as possible in our thinking, given the urgency of the situation that we are addressing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have spent time with a number of representatives of the opposition and the wider public in Belarus, including, as I have mentioned, relatives of those detained. I have also met Foreign Minister Martynov. These conversations have left me in no doubt that the events we witnessed were an affront to our vision of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. Not only was there unwarranted use of force, but the electoral process as a whole was also clearly undermined by the detention of civil society and opposition representatives. The assessment by the OSCE-ODIHR supports this conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of those detained in the last few weeks have been released. However, a significant group – as many as 30 people – still face charges that could lead to very substantial prison sentences and, as honourable Members know, that group includes some presidential candidates.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have already condemned the repressive measures taken by the authorities in Minsk and I have called for the immediate release of all those detained on political grounds, as well as the reopening of the OSCE office in Minsk. I have reinforced this message in a joint statement with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my meeting with Foreign Minister Martynov, I emphasised that the EU expects an immediate response from the Belarusian authorities to the demands of the international community. In determining the next steps we take, we need to start from basic principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first of these principles is that the security and safety of peaceful activists, including presidential candidates, must be at the forefront of our minds at all times.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second is that Belarusians are our neighbours and partners, and their interests should be paramount. While we express our concern to the authorities, we cannot isolate the people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third principle is that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is at the core of EU foreign policy and of the Eastern Partnership and is part of a set of common values which we share with our closest partners. We will work with those partners, as we have done with the United States, to maximise the strength of the message sent to Belarus by the international community.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, our assessment leads to a clear conclusion: that we should use our channels to convey a firm and prompt reaction. That reaction should give the authorities in Belarus a clear signal of our views, without isolating citizens and civil society. Our reaction should be a balanced one. On the one hand, we have to consider targeted measures against the Belarusian authorities and, I believe, to conduct a review of sanctions. On the other hand, we need to have an intensified dialogue with, and to support, civil society and citizens – and, in practical terms, that means continuing our assistance to NGOs, the media and students, and perhaps an increased effort to enhance mobility for citizens who wish to travel to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the short term, reintroducing a travel ban for President Lukashenko, and extending that ban to further named individuals, is certainly an option if detainees are not released.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to intensified support for civil society, I have asked the External Action Service, in cooperation with the Commission, to prepare options for urgent measures focusing on NGOs, media and students. I know that the European Parliament has scope to provide scholarships for students expelled from university and I hope, Mr President, that this facility can be exploited. Of course we shall be trying to leverage additional resources from elsewhere, including Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I mentioned earlier the issue of mobility and I am thinking in particular of visa facilitation: I want to encourage Member States’ consulates in Minsk to facilitate the delivery of visas as an ad hoc measure in the interests of Belarusian citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the short-term measures I have just described will, of course, have to be considered by the Foreign Affairs Council on 31 January, but it is not too early to reflect on some longer-term aspects of our relations with Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I said earlier that we need to work with other international partners on this issue and that is one reason why Belarus should continue to participate in the multilateral track that we have available, and why we need to engage strongly with our Eastern Partnership countries to build a consensus on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, as far as bilateral financial assistance from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) is concerned, we should place a stronger focus on the needs of the population and on civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, last year, we drew up a joint interim plan, mapping out the development of our relations with Belarus in the medium term. I believe we need to pause in this process. That does not mean abandoning the joint interim plan, but we need further consultation, including with civil society, and a review if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is the framework within which we are currently working. I am now very interested to hear the views of Members of Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there was no room for doubt in the minds of international observers, and there should be no room for any doubt whatsoever in our minds. The recent presidential elections held in Belarus in December were not fair. They were not fair, and so the policy that we have been conducting since 2008 with regard to the Belarusian authorities, a policy of dialogue with Belarus and an outstretched hand, cannot be continued any longer. This is not the time for ‘business as usual’; this is the time for new decisions, a new policy and a hard line in dealings with the Belarusian regime, by which I also mean both political and visa sanctions, without ruling out economic sanctions. We should, of course, make intelligent use of such sanctions and target them in such a way as to ensure that the lives of ordinary Belarusians are not affected, but we should not hesitate to impose them, including the suspension of Belarus’ membership in the Eastern Partnership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Since the elections were unfair, the results of the elections are not credible. We can thus state, calmly and in full awareness of the facts, that the Belarusian democratic opposition can claim a moral victory in these elections. We should therefore support the opposition in its attempts to create a political representation here in Brussels to represent both its interests and the interests of the whole of free Belarus in its dealings with the European Union and the Member States at a political level. Finally, we should demand the release of those who have been arrested, both the presidential candidates and the political activists, independent journalists, students and university lecturers. They must all be released before we engage in any further talks with representatives of the Belarusian state.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Lady Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament expresses its great regret that these presidential elections have turned into another missed opportunity for the country to set out firmly and with commitment on the road to democracy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We can, however, say that essentially, the European Union’s policy of gradually engaging Belarus on certain conditions has yielded certain results, so we should be wary of calls for a radical change to our policy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I say this because it is thanks to our engagement that the presidential campaign ultimately made some progress, and it could be that it was also the reason why many more people gathered on the square in Minsk than the organisers had expected. In other words, we had probably generated an atmosphere of greater freedom which the citizens of Belarus may have interpreted correctly.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, from here on, we have to be, in the first place, clear and firm enough with our demands to the authorities in Belarus to free those detained and to immediately stop persecuting all those who took part in or organised the protests in one form or another. We cannot compromise on this, and we have to be quite clear about what we want.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Anther element, however, is what we can do in the medium and long term. Firstly, we have to avoid casting the country back into isolation, because in that way, as the representatives of the opposition and of civil society stressed, Belarus’ isolation means the isolation of the country’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="bg">What we have to do is, within the framework of the policy we already have towards Belarus, to try and take certain measures to adjust our policy, so that it benefits the country’s citizens and supports its media, civil society, the opposition. In this way, we can create an environment in which fair and democratic elections will be possible.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We should, in my view, work towards this with Belarus’ non-EU neighbours, Russia and Ukraine, and, as a parliament, try and use the opportunities provided by the Eastern Partnership and EURONEST to engage the other five countries in the Partnership in joint activities to democratise Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="de">The deterioration of democracy in Russia might also be the very reason why the Kremlin has recognised the Belarusian presidential elections and described the violent repression as an ‘internal affair’ of Belarus. Such indifference to the appalling situation in Belarus is a significant sign of tendencies in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament has come up with a strong resolution that proposes targeted visa and economic sanctions against the criminal regime of Lukashenko. It is vital that the European Union stands united on this and that the Member States cease pursuing any bilateral initiatives with Lukashenko and his regime. We must suspend the Eastern Partnership and other cooperation until the political prisoners are released. At the same time, we must increase support to civil society, NGOs and independent media in Belarus in order to prepare them for the build-up of Belarus after the downfall of Lukashenko, which will hopefully take place by means of democratic elections.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think that the High Representative is completely echoing our feelings when she says she was shocked.</p>
      <p sl="en">We were indeed shocked after 19 December, as many of us had already hoped that there would be a gradual opening-up of Belarus towards the European Union. I now think that a lot of those hopes have gone for the time being. It is very worrying to hear – almost hourly – news of ongoing repression in Minsk and other parts of Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just yesterday, the harassment of the human rights organisation Viasna continued, with house raids, arrests and detentions. This is an organisation which has very courageously been defending human rights in Belarus. The authorities have still not allowed it to register.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Belarusian Helsinki Committee received a warning after it contacted the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers. It has good reason to believe that those charged with these serious offences are not going to be given a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, we also had news of the former presidential candidate, Mr Sannikov, his spouse Iryna Khalip, a journalist and correspondent of the Novaya Gazeta in Minsk, and their child – which was a worldwide sensation. We have heard that the child may be allowed to stay with its grandparents, as the parents are detained. However, I would just warn that this is not good news yet. We still need confirmation, which may arrive next week.</p>
      <p sl="en">So why is this ‘strike hard’ happening in Belarus? We really need to insist on an independent international inquiry into what happened, in order to understand all the background and to understand whether provocateurs actually instigated this violence – which has now been declared criminal – and not those who were actually only calling for democracy in Belarus. In my view, the most appropriate body to conduct such an investigation would be the OSCE and, failing that, the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">What about new elections? We should be careful about calling for new elections too soon because we need to safeguard the road map towards democratic reforms. We need to guarantee freedom of the press, of association and of assembly. Without that, we would not be gaining much, even if Belarus held new elections today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are talking about the situation in Belarus, but let us not pass the buck. It is easy to level accusations at the Lukashenko regime, which deserves such accusations, and we should indeed accuse and denounce it. However, Europe should also take some of the blame. Is it not the case that the visit of the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, served to lend credence of sorts to the regime? Is it not the case that the visit of the Lithuanian President, Mrs Grybauskaitė, served to lend credence to the regime? Is it not the case that the visit of the German and Polish foreign affairs ministers, Mr Westerwelle and Mr Sikorski, served to lend credence to the regime, and indeed came in very useful for the regime? The truth of the matter is that politicians from European Union Member States have given Mr Lukashenko a certain amount of room for political manoeuvre, without asking for anything whatsoever in return. Today, we must demand respect for human rights, but also take blame where blame is due.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, my group has not signed up to the compromise resolution on Belarus. However, I would like to make it clear that this should not be seen as an acceptance on our part of the results of the election, the arrests and the reprisals against those with differing opinions. For us, fair, transparent and democratic elections – ‘the freedom of dissenters’ to quote Rosa Luxemburg – are a basic requirement for establishing a relationship with Belarus and with all other states. This also includes the immediate release of all political detainees.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I doubt whether sanctions are really an effective means of bringing about the immediate release of political prisoners and radical changes in the democratic system in Belarus. Sanctions have had little effect in the past in Belarus and elsewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, you are as well aware of this as I am. A better approach seems to me to be to confront those who hold political power with our arguments and demands in the context of a political dialogue, not to give them the opportunity to discredit the criticisms made by those in civil society by referring to external criticism, to establish a transparent political system and to coordinate our efforts with those of all our foreign policy partners in Belarus. This also seems to be more honest in relation to our own arguments, as this morning’s discussion on the Hungarian Presidency has shown.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the brutal repression of any political alternative to President Lukashenko’s regime since the election of 19 December 2010 has clearly reduced Minsk’s room for manoeuvre in the outside world. Belarus, on its own initiative, has abruptly discontinued the shuttle diplomacy which it had been conducting between Moscow and Brussels for the past three years. Currently, President Lukashenko is managing to maintain strong political and economic ties with the Kremlin. It is precisely this dependent relationship that demands a greater European involvement in Belarus’s civil society.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Do, therefore, by all means, continue pursuing the mind change strategy as a necessary step towards regime change. Do actively demonstrate European solidarity. For example, reduce visa costs for Belarusians as soon as possible. Next, initiate a critical strategic discussion with the Belarusian political opposition and, as part of the same process, pay particular attention to reformist forces within the power apparatus. That is balanced politics. Brussels must not abandon Minsk now. Do not leave Belarusians subject to Russian or Chinese law; chart an independent path for them towards a free society and the democratic rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Alexander Lukashenko has never missed an opportunity to prove himself a dictator. The December elections were actually a ritual of re-appointment. But we in the EU clung to the illusion that Lukashenko would miraculously change. Indeed, we said we would wait for the December elections. The elections came and Lukashenko remains the same and the opposition is either in hospital or in jail.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is time for the EU to reconsider its approach to Belarus. Clearly there is no place for Belarus in the Eastern Partnership. Belarus should be suspended. Our only partner should be civil society. I await the results of the Foreign Affairs Council on 31 January and I hope that both Lady Ashton and Commissioner Füle recommend suspension.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, regarding the implications for the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, we can no longer give Lukashenko a veto on Euronest. Belarus was used to block Euronest. Therefore, the conclusion is that Euronest should be launched as a matter of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, High Representative, the European Parliament resolution on which we will vote tomorrow should send a strong message to Belarusians, the whole of Europe and the world. There must at least be a return as soon as possible to the situation that existed prior to 19 December and combined efforts to ensure that Belarus follows the path towards democracy and strengthening human rights. The most important objective today is the release of political prisoners and a cessation of attacks against the opposition, non-governmental organisations and the free press. However, I agree with the High Representative that when we take a swing at the regime, we must not hit Belarusian citizens. We must calculate with millimetre accuracy whether we will harm Belarusians, as well as mutually beneficial ties with EU Member States in the fields of business, culture, education and tourism, which are essential for the opening up of Belarus in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The recent policy of dialogue with Belarus has borne some fruit: now almost half of all Belarusians are in favour of closer relations with the European Union. We must react to events in Minsk so that from next year, this figure would grow even more. That would be a tangibly painful reward for the organisers of 19 December. In conclusion, I would again like to mention the financial, visa-related Berlin wall, which unfortunately has grown between the European Union and its eastern neighbours, and which is most difficult to overcome in Belarus. It is high time to tear down that wall and make it possible for ordinary Ukrainians, Belarusians, Georgians and Russians to have access to and obtain visas to the European Union without any difficulty. Those millions of euro that are taken in incomprehensibly high visa fees really are not recouped because they deepen the chasms inherited from the past, this time between European Union Member States and their neighbours. It really should not be like this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in life, and certainly in politics, hope is very important. Hope provides something to look forward to, hope allows people to believe that things will be better in the future, and hope is what has been very much absent from Belarus since 19 December. The hope that these elections would be more democratic than the previous ones. The hope that the opposition would have better odds this time and the hope that the Belarusian media would present a more balanced picture to the citizens of Belarus. All of those hopes have been dashed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is precisely why the EU should change its policy on Belarus. Unfortunately, the policy of rapprochement with the regime has not worked. The EU will have to impose sanctions on the Belarusian leadership. Sanctions which will affect, not its citizens, but its leaders. Sanctions such as withdrawing all visas for the leaders and their families. This last thing is important, if we are to break the complex ties between political and economic power in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fortunately, Lady Ashton seems to be on the right track. The Commission has also responded appropriately by demanding the immediate release of all political prisoners. This Parliament, too, could also make a contribution by sending a mission to Belarus, as soon as possible, in order to show the opposition, the free media and the NGOs there that we support them. It is only with their help and through their efforts that the new Belarus will be able to take shape.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude, the EU should give a new impetus to the neighbourhood programme. So far, this programme has not exactly lived up to its promise. We should not just support the development citizenship in Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Using the same approach, we could also show Belarusians how important it is for their country’s future, too, that they seek a rapprochement with Europe. If we do this, we will ensure that hope returns once again to the people of Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, our hopes that Belarus would move closer to democracy after the presidential elections have been bitterly disappointed. Despite all our negative experiences and our reservations concerning the government of Mr Lukashenko, the EU has stretched out its hand to Belarus over recent months. The extent to which the proposed cooperation would depend on these elections was made entirely clear and, for a while, it seemed as if the elections would be at least partially fair, correct and free.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the slight concessions have obviously shaken up the repressive system in such a way that the President has once again revealed his true colours as a ruthless dictator. His alleged election is a dreadful sham, his power is not legitimate and his violence against the opposition is a brutal crime. The electoral fraud and the suppression of protests represent a significant step backwards for Belarus. Once again, there is an atmosphere of fear and repression in the country. The electoral fraudsters brazenly claimed that foreign secret services and diplomats had intervened when, in fact, the system itself had sent out the agitators. It is also outrageous that the secret service, which is controlled by the President and still calls itself the KGB, is using methods from the Stalin era to terrorise the opposition and civil society.</p>
      <p sl="de">This violation of fundamental human rights by a member of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is unacceptable. The post-communist regime has become unbearable. We have drawn up a parliamentary resolution which forms a good basis for the discussions between the European foreign ministers. The resolution focuses primarily on the immediate release of detainees, medical care for the injured, the dropping of absurd accusations and the establishment of an independent investigation committee, together with targeted political and economic sanctions, which will have an impact on those in power, but not on the population.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must now support the pro-European forces within the country whose hopes we have raised, who want a change of government and who have cast their votes. They see the future of their country as being in the EU and not in a closer relationship with Russia. The fact that the first leaders to congratulate Mr Lukashenko on his election victory were the Russian President, Mr Medvedev, the Russian Prime Minister, Mr Putin, and the President of Ukraine, Mr Yanukovych, demonstrates their understanding of democracy and the bleak prospects awaiting Belarus in this direction.</p>

Well, Mrs Hautala, there is one more thing to say in addition to the information you gave us about the organisation Viasna.

The second very important thing you said was that we must not isolate Belarusian society. The measures we take should adhere to this principle, and they really must be ‘soft’ measures, or, in other words, building civil society, supporting the media and students and abolishing visas. We should support such measures and, in particular, earmark more funding for them.

We need a long-term strategy and action and it will really be a test for the new foreign policy which Lady Ashton is now heading.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not only about Belarus. How we tackle the Belarus question will determine the true political dynamics of the whole region: in Moldova, in Ukraine, also vis-à-vis Russia and elsewhere. For the moment, geopolitically speaking, the course of events takes Belarus away from Europe, and Europe is in retreat as it is in Ukraine. Obviously, we are right to recommend the double-check approach: sanction and isolate the regime, open increased assistance to the society. I would say: let us replace the carrot-and-stick policies directed towards the regime so far with ‘stick to regime and carrot to society’. However, to a much greater degree, we should remember that our partner is society, not the regime.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as we debate here today, it appears that Alexander Lukashenko is rushing through plans for an inauguration this Friday, with no international guests, precisely because the international community does not recognise the Belarus elections as free, fair or transparent. If it goes ahead, it will be a black Friday to follow what has begun to be dubbed ‘Bloody Sunday’, 19 December, when 700 democratic protestors were arrested, including seven of the nine presidential candidates in the elections, one of whom has had both his legs broken and another beaten by riot police until he sustained brain damage.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask the Vice-President/High Representative and the EU Member States to back the Polish proposals for a visa ban and, as our resolution makes clear, support the principle for further targeted economic sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, one of the things that the European Union can do is to express clear and simple demands for the release of all political prisoners, for the authorities to lift any threat of banning or restricting the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, and for quick movement towards the organisation of new elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the future, I agree with what has been said today both by Catherine Ashton and by my own group, that we need to keep the multilateral track open and we need to put an emphasis on civil society and support for it. But I do say that this is not simply a watershed moment for democracy and human rights in Belarus: it is a test of Europe’s own Neighbourhood Policy. Yes, we seek clear and closer cooperation and partnership with our neighbours to encourage a process of increasing congruence with those on our borders where there is a genuine mutual commitment to do so, but this will not work if there is an absence of actions when that mutual commitment is missing and things are going wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">The pain we should worry about in this debate is not the pain intended of proposed smart sanctions by Europe against Belarus, but the physical pain of the beatings inflicted on people who share Europe’s commitment to democracy and human rights and who need us to stand together with them in solidarity so that the long years of pain of Belarus can come to an end.</p>

A policy of agreement and tolerance could not bring about the desired effect.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I fully agree with my colleagues in suggesting sanctions against top Lukashenko cronies and providing support and assistance to the Belarus opposition, NGOs and ordinary citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The joint motion for a resolution mentions the possible move of the 2014 world ice hockey championship away from Belarus if political prisoners are not released. This is a reasonable and extremely effective tool. Mr Lukashenko is an avid hockey fan and so are the citizens of Belarus. Such a move would certainly raise attention and many questions across the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The IHF is the body in charge of such a decision. It could be a chance to improve their tarnished image, caused by admitting to the IHF Council a former high-ranking KGB officer and Communist spy in the USA and a person who helped to defraud hundreds of thousands of citizens out of billions of dollars. When the time comes, I hope the IHF will make the right decision.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, it is good that several of us here have openly admitted that the so-called policy dialogue of the EU and many Member States has failed. Lukashenko, who is a clever political player, has been able to exploit his campaign programme, has enjoyed all the political and economic benefits, and, at the same time, has continued to pour contempt on democracy and human rights. He has even succeeded in charming a few politicians here, like Mr Rubiks, whose greatest concern in this situation seems to be whether the opposition will acquire help from abroad.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The sanctions that the resolution demands must definitely be implemented against the political leadership. At the same time, however, we must ensure that help reaches the ordinary people who have lost their jobs and student places while hoping for democracy to come along. Now it really is the last chance for the EU to show its colours and demonstrate that we support the people of Belarus in their struggle for democracy, and that we want Europe’s last dictator out.</p>

As we are all aware, Belarus is the last dictatorship in Europe, and we should show our full solidarity. As we are also all aware, the US is providing only limited funds in this area, and the proposal which we would like to put forward today is a very significant programme of funding aimed at supporting both the opposition, the media and non-governmental organisations, but also, and above all, the young elite. I am talking here primarily about the hundreds or even thousands of Belarusian students who are currently unable to continue their studies, and I would like to make a very specific proposal, namely, that a special Erasmus programme be prepared, within the already functioning Erasmus system, targeted exclusively at Belarusian students. We know that we can make huge savings by using this programme, and that it will not require much effort, but the creation of a modern young future for a democratic state may prove effective in the long term, and I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that this is the case.</p>

    <intervention id="3-552-000" speaker_id="28306" name="Ana Gomes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Libya has a strategic position with regard to controlling migratory flows to Europe, in addition to significant energy resources and great potential as a neighbour and partner in the Maghreb.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Some Member States have close relations with Libya, but it is important to ensure that such relations are duly anchored in the fundamental values and interests of the Union. Therefore, we support the development of relations with Libya through the establishment of a framework agreement covering various areas of cooperation with a view to stimulating a substantial political dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot forget, however, that Libya is governed by a dictatorial regime with a history of serious breaches of human rights and terrorist attacks and interference in other countries, though, in the last few years, there have been signs that it wants to do a U-turn. Consequently, the framework agreement with Libya can only have the consent of this Parliament if certain conditions are met. A sine qua non condition is that Libya allows the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to operate in the country again with an extended mandate. Let me say it quite clearly: no UNHCR, no agreement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Libya must be persuaded to ratify the Geneva Convention on Refugees. As it is already a party to the African Refugee Convention, it is difficult to understand why its internal legal order does not recognise refugee status.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Any re-admission agreement between the European Union and Libya has to exclude all those who claim to be asylum seekers, refugees or persons requiring international protection, and it must be applied completely in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement. Critical situations, such as occurred with the 400 Eritreans who were on the verge of being expelled en masse from Libya last summer, must not happen again.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union must encourage Libya to adopt legal and social solutions that improve the inhuman living conditions of the approximately 2 million immigrants – about a quarter of the population – who are working in Libya. These immigrants deserve legal protection and cannot continue to be treated as abeed, slaves. The European Union has to invest in joint programmes to combat the growing traffic in people, which has devastating consequences, particularly for women and children. The European Union’s support for the International Organisation for Migration and all the organisations that help migrants in transit in Libya must be increased to improve the conditions of migrants interned in detention centres, which are starting to fill up again, in spite of suddenly being emptied in the middle of last year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Union cannot abstain from persuading Libya to commit itself to a moratorium on the death penalty and it is essential that it demands that the Libyan authorities publish the identity of national and foreign citizens who are executed. The Union must insist that Libya ratifies the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Within the framework of cooperation, the Union must encourage reforms that modernise social, political and judicial structures, which open the country to the outside, which expose society to free information, which promote independence of the media and which invest in the institutional capacity building of corporate and labour organisations and other organisations that are representative of civil society. The Bouazizi revolution in Tunisia will certainly have repercussions in neighbouring Libya, and even the Gaddafi regime can understand that.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have to strengthen the support given to the health sector in Libya through the Action Plan for Benghazi by extending it to other medical centres and other public health requirements. We understand that the negotiations between the European Commission and Libya are at an advanced stage, though some difficulties have emerged with regard to trade and energy cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">From our point of view, it would be advantageous to set up an EU office in Tripoli soon to facilitate the negotiations and monitor the development of the situation in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, in these recommendations, we ask the Commission for detailed information on the budget lines used and planned in the cooperation with Libya. I hope that you will be able to let us have this information soon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I wish to point out that only recently did Parliament have the opportunity to consent to the Council’s mandate for the negotiations. That is unacceptable and cannot continue. Finally, I would like to express my thanks for the cooperation of all the shadow rapporteurs, who were essential for the broad consensus that has been achieved on potentially such a divisive topic.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to brief this House regarding the negotiations on the European Union-Libya Framework Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission and the European Parliament are already working closely on the Libyan issue. We have a joint interest in ensuring the positive development of our relations with Libya, which is an important neighbour. In this context, I would particularly like to congratulate your Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries for the agreement reached during the visit to Tripoli, which indeed provides for regular consultation with the Libyan Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am determined to ensure that the close cooperation between our institutions continues. In particular, I am keen to inform the European Parliament regularly about the latest developments regarding negotiations on the Framework Agreement. I know that our chief negotiator debriefs you after each negotiation session.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give you some information on the latest state of play. We completed the ninth round of negotiations in mid-November in Tripoli. The next one is scheduled for 24-26 January in Brussels. Since the launch of negotiations more than two years ago, we have made good progress. In fact, we have provisionally agreed the preamble and six out of ten titles of the Agreement. In particular, we have reached a provisional agreement on the title on political dialogue, which contains important references to respect for human rights, the fight against weapons of mass destruction, the fight against terrorism, etc. Libya has agreed to establish a regular dialogue on human rights and fundamental freedoms, which was a key objective for us. In fact, we are very satisfied with the outcome achieved in this title.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you might be aware, there are some outstanding issues, namely, the questions of energy and trade. Energy represents the core of Libya’s economy – indeed, 70% of Libya’s GDP. Therefore, the attention and caution Libya devotes to this issue is understandable. As for trade, Libya has limited experience negotiating complex trade agreements. This is why progress has been moderate in this field. Experts from both sides meet very regularly to ensure that we can reach agreement on these two issues as soon as possible but, of course, there are difficult political issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of them is the question of the Rome Statute. Libya categorically refuses to make an explicit reference to the Rome Statute. However, it is ready to make a commitment on cooperation with the European Union on the fight against impunity, in particular, on those crimes defined in the Rome Statute.</p>
      <p sl="en">On migration there are also difficulties, notably because Libya refuses to readmit third-country nationals. I have taken note of the recommendation made by this House regarding this particular aspect of the negotiation and I will certainly discuss this with Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also on migration, I can reassure this House that we are committed to ensuring that Libya respects its international commitments regarding the principle of non-refoulement. This is an important point for the European Union. We also consider that it is important that Libya should adhere as soon as possible to the 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1967 Protocol on the status of refugees. However, it should be noted that Libya has indicated that it does not intend to adhere to this Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to stress that we are following closely negotiation between Libya and the UNHCR in the hope that a satisfactory solution will be found to ensure that the UNHCR is able to discharge its mandate fully and in a legally secure environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">More generally, in October, we reached an agreement with a view to developing cooperation with Libya on all migration-related issues, including the issues of international protection, improving the conditions of migrants in Libya, management of migration and border control. This is a positive development because we need to work jointly with Libya to tackle all the challenges that it faces in relation to migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me conclude on the issue of the negotiating directives, which this House has repeatedly requested access to. I am fully aware of the obligations created by Article 218 of the Lisbon Treaty. As you know, negotiating directives are a classified document of the Council. This is why the Council had to study your request in a horizontal manner. I am glad to tell you that this debate has been concluded and, as you are probably aware, the Council has granted access to the negotiating directives of the European Union-Libya Framework Agreement in respect of the agreed procedures and of the Council’s security regulations. The Council has informed the Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the June 2009 Council recommended prioritising the conclusion of readmission agreements with Libya and Turkey, considered as major gates for illegal immigration into Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Libyan gate mainly affects Malta and Italy. Massive illegal immigration in Malta risks altering its demographic composition. Although shared responsibility is recognised by all, little is done in practice to correct this development. The number of arrivals in Malta decreased only when Italy, equally affected, reached a bilateral agreement with Libya, in which Libya assumed responsibility for patrolling its shores and harbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is needed is an EU-Libya readmission agreement in the context of a framework agreement. Negotiations are difficult, but we support the Commission’s efforts and we encourage it to continue until it succeeds.</p>
      <p sl="en">We commend the migration and cooperation agreement concluded between the Commission and Libya last October. It is essential to prepare Libya with regard to issues such as the protection system for asylum seekers, the management of land borders, the alignment of legislation with the African convention on refugees and the management of migratory flows.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know about the human rights situation, the dependent judiciary, the conditions of detention, torture and capital punishment in Libya. However, the readmission agreement is necessary. This excludes people who are entitled to asylum, need political protection, or risk mistreatment in Libya, while the principle of non-refoulement applies to everybody.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work done by Mrs Gomes in my view makes a serious contribution to what the Commission should do in defining the framework agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">Libya undoubtedly plays a decisive role in the fight against terrorism, in peace and security in Africa, in the fight against illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, and in the energy sector. Our aim in the context of the European Union’s strategy must therefore be to consolidate Libya’s integration into an international political and economic system based on shared rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">To achieve that, a number of conditions need to be imposed on Libya, and that is what the recommendation is calling for. First of all, in the matter of immigration, Libya is clearly a transit country. This is an extremely important subject, but it cannot be seen simply in terms of security, stopping immigration and refoulement.</p>
      <p sl="it">The subject involves the need for a government ruled by the streams of economic and social policies equal to the challenge of migration, the issues of the recognition of political refugees and the ratification by Libya of the Geneva Convention and, lastly, the problem of the readmission of immigrants based on concrete guarantees to safeguard the immigrants’ living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there is the question of launching economic and democratic reforms to make decidedly more room for democracy in this important country. We shall have to take this issue into ever greater account, as the events in neighbouring Tunisia are showing.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, this recommendation calls for reflection on the issue of bilateral agreements. Such agreements can certainly make a valid contribution to defining and solving problems, but they are not the final answer. For example, the problem we have with Italian fishing boats shows that the bilateral agreement option does not address these problems. Now, however, the review of the partnership and neighbourhood policies also involves the call to rethink the Libya question in a new framework, which means including Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many of us have called for the Council’s mandate for the framework agreement to be made known. In this respect, Commissioner, there is a real need to break step and involve the European Parliament more and more in defining new policies for the countries to the south of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Regarding this report, I would like to highlight the importance of addressing the situation of immigrants in Libya trying to cross the Mediterranean. I can fully understand the concerns of the southern Member States relating to the flow of illegal immigrants and the pressure it puts on their budgets as well as on society in general.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, while keeping in mind the interests of Member States, we cannot set aside European values. The EU cannot afford to have the blood of any asylum-seeker or refugee on its hands.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we witnessed in Tunisia the rising of the people against an oppressive and abusive regime which has denied them basic human rights for years. It is a big source of shame for the EU that for many years, we have been supportive of this dictatorship. To make things even worse, the EU risks committing the same mistakes in Tunisia’s neighbouring country, Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the Commission and the Council do not change course, it will continue to prop up yet another dictator in the region in the name of stability and border control and migration. For years, the Gaddafi regime, one of Ben Ali’s best friends as we have seen recently again, has been systematically violating the human rights of its citizens and especially of migrant workers. Nevertheless, the EU and several of its Member States have increasingly close relations with Libya, and the EU is now even negotiating this framework agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore urge the Council and Commission to notice the writing on the wall and ensure the following conditions are fully satisfied before we can conclude any agreement with Libya:</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, Libya needs to ratify and implement the UN refugee convention and grant the UNCHR full access to the country; secondly, it needs to guarantee adequate protection and rights for migrants and adopt asylum legislation including the principle of non-refoulement; thirdly, no readmission agreement with Libya can be concluded until the high risk of inhuman and degrading treatment faced by migrants in Libya has ceased to exist.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, on that matter, because I do not think this will come too soon, I really wish the Commission to fail in the negotiations on the readmission agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, Parliament needs to be fully informed at all stages of the negotiation process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Greens strongly object to any dirty deal with a dictator like Gaddafi on the back of migrants and Libyan citizens. Continued EU support for this oppressive regime is neither in line with the EU’s values and legal commitments, nor does it serve its long-term interests in the region. As we have so vividly seen now in Tunisia, only a democratic and free country will be truly stable and prosperous.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Libya is a country where human rights are routinely abused and democracy is non-existent. Colonel Gaddafi has never stood for election since coming to power 41 years ago. Indeed, political parties are banned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Gaddafi is the Fidel Castro of Africa. He tries to portray himself as a benevolent father of his own people, even claiming that he has no formal role in the state hierarchy. We in my country, the UK, know him differently as a previous sponsor of terrorism, in particular, the Lockerbie bombing of 1988.</p>
      <p sl="en">To polish up his international image he has, to his credit I suppose, compensated grieving families, but in truth, the maverick Gaddafi would be totally ostracised by the West were it not for Libya’s prodigious reserves of oil and gas. This gives Gaddafi leverage over the EU and, in particular, he has sought to divide the Council by courting the leadership of certain Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, on pragmatic grounds, I accept the need for cordial trading and diplomatic relations between the EU and Libya under a framework agreement. But I do fear that all we are really doing is consolidating Gaddafi’s power, which, in due course, inevitably will pass to one of his sons in a dynastic succession akin to that of North Korea.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her work and Mr Füle for being here today. We consider that in what is, from every point of view, a sensitive region, constant efforts should be made in the Mediterranean to develop understanding and cooperation, cooperation on an equal footing that takes account of the asymmetries and inequalities that exist in the various sectors of development between countries in the Mediterranean and between the European Union and its neighbouring countries in the region, cooperation that targets lasting peace. This can be achieved through dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and, as such, we must be open to reciprocal influence. Within this framework, we are in favour of strengthening relations between the European Union and Libya.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, there are certain sensitive issues which require particular attention in the process of developing these relations. I shall comment mainly on the issue of refugees, immigrants and the readmission agreement. The aim is to achieve a readmission agreement with Libya, as part of the framework agreement being discussed between the European Union and Libya. If such an agreement is signed without any concomitant reforms to improve the social and economic circumstances of immigrants, this will add to the continuing infringements of human rights, meaning that we shall be advocating the forced return of immigrants to conditions which do not guarantee their safety or minimum acceptable living standards.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need to demand that the Libyan authorities duly recognise the presence of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. We must also address the sensitive issue of the death penalty. The right thing to do would be to seek an agreement suspending its application in Libya, with the ultimate aim being its abolition.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of concluding the framework agreement between the European Union and Libya because it is a step forward compared to the past on important points such as immigration, cooperation in economic and health matters, particularly the fight against AIDS, and, to some extent, the energy programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important subject is Libya’s control over terrorist activities, not only on its own territory, but also on the country’s southern borders. Progress has been made with an agreement between the Council and the Libyan Government, including on general principles such as the Statute of Rome and the United Nations Convention on Refugees. Much remains to be done – that is obvious – but it is important for Parliament to support the agreement already negotiated without bringing it back into discussion and risk losing the results that have already been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope the collaboration between the European Union and Libya brings about the same results that were achieved with the Friendship Agreement between Libya and Italy, which, amongst other things, has settled the long-standing dispute over the country’s colonial past.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the European Commission has provided a new export product to Libya, a rogue state, and its dictator Gaddafi. Oil production is not the only way that Libya makes money these days – it also enriches itself by blackmailing Europe. Dictator Gaddafi will pocket EUR 60 million of European taxpayers’ money in return for preventing fortune seekers from Africa from reaching Europe. That EUR 60 million is just the beginning, because Mr Gaddafi is now demanding that that amount be increased to EUR 5 billion each year and backing up his demands with threats. It could be that the European Commission has allowed itself to be led astray by Mr Gaddafi’s pretty face, but I do not trust that man one inch.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have a few newspaper articles with me from recent years: Gaddafi demands billions from the EU. Libya puts pressure on London and Edinburgh. Gaddafi wants more money or else he will let Europe turn black. Gaddafi: ‘Islam must become the religion of Europe’. Gaddafi rejects democracy in favour of strict observance of Sharia law. Gaddafi uses 30 million Africans who want to come to Europe as a bargaining chip. Gaddafi wants to launch a jihad against Switzerland.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Honourable Members of the European Parliament, we should not reward this scoundrel Gaddafi. We should punish him if Libya continues to allow so many refugees free access to Europe. Nor should we reward the refugees with refugee status or permanent residence. They should be sent straight back to Africa. Rewarding refugees with European refugee status, benefits and training programmes will lumber us with an even bigger stream of asylum seekers, with many drowning in the attempt to get a foothold on the European mainland. The European Union’s generous and feeble asylum policy is the real cause of the large influx of asylum seekers.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Libya is quite good at ratifying international agreements, but it seems to be just as good at refraining from implementing these agreements. It is a disgrace that Libya has a seat and a vote in the UN Human Rights Council. Incidentally, it is also a disgrace that Saudi Arabia does too. By means of forceful pressure from its largest trade partner, the EU, Libya really should be made to pay attention to what respect for human rights and freedoms means and what these entail.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As we all know, the EU’s relations with Libya concern various aspects of how refugees should be treated. Until the Council and the Commission can persuade Libya to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to reside lawfully in the country, it will not be feasible to feel the slightest degree of confidence about how refugees are treated in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Libya’s leader is a master of capriciousness and unreliability. The EU is now about to conclude a framework agreement with him. I cannot help but wonder what the term ‘framework’ means to a regime like Colonel Gaddafi’s, which shows disrespect without bounds when it comes to human rights issues. We know that Libya practices widespread discrimination against migrant workers on account of their nationality and that the racist persecution of African migrant workers exists.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Human dignity is more important than money. Therefore, respect of human rights and freedoms must, in fact, be so important as to prevent us from handing over people to a state in which torture or other forms of inhumane treatment are practised. This is, incidentally, what the charters of the European Union require.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Libya is the European Union’s third biggest supplier of oil and gas, while the Union is Libya’s main trading partner, accounting for more than two thirds of this country’s total trade. We must also take into account the progress made by the authorities in Tripoli, which have successfully shifted the country from a situation of isolation and embargos to becoming open and economically and diplomatically dynamic.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the European Union is not merely a community of economic interests, but is based on a set of values which we cannot abandon for the sake of pragmatism. Admittedly, Libya no longer sponsors terrorism, has abandoned its nuclear programme, agreed to pay compensation to the families of terrorist attack victims, released the Bulgarian nurses condemned to death for spreading HIV and concluded agreements with some European states. I think that we must encourage this progress, but the partnership between the European Union and Libya needs to have a solid moral foundation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this respect, the report from Mrs Gomes, whom I would like to congratulate on the job she has done, highlights the serious shortcomings in the respect for human rights, which we are duty-bound to tackle. Last year, we adopted a resolution in which we asked Libya to abolish capital punishment. I believe that it is appropriate for us to reiterate this request for abolition, backed up by the request to comply with international norms for legal fairness, especially as foreigners are victims of abuses.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Particular attention must be focused on the problem of migrants and refugees, both those extradited by Libya to their countries of origin where their lives are exposed to serious threats, and those returned by Italy to Libya where they are likely to face harsh reprisals. On the other hand, pressure is required for Libyan asylum legislation to be adopted and for agreements to open the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which kept a record in Libya of almost 13 000 refugees and asylum seekers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As regards the readmission agreement as part of the EU-Libya Framework Agreement, I call on the Council to drop this plan as it would involve repatriation to a country which systematically violates human rights. The policy of the Berlusconi government cannot be accepted as the example to follow. The Italian exception must not become the European rule.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is barely credible for the European institutions to still want to conclude a framework agreement with a dictatorship like Libya.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot go on saying that Libya has very important trading relations with European Union Member States and acts as a partner for the European Union in the Mediterranean basin, and putting respect for human rights as a secondary issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">The primary condition for us to be able to start a credible dialogue with Libya is for that country to ratify the Geneva Convention. We cannot barter economic interests for human lives: not just the lives of Libyan citizens, but also of people from other countries who are fleeing civil wars and religious persecution and pass through Libya only to find death and horrendous torture.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have a duty not to forget the thousands of calls for help made by people held in Libyan prisons. We cannot forget the horrors that Gandufa prison revealed to us.</p>
      <p sl="it">Libyan citizens do not enjoy many political and civil rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly and association. The oral amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which seeks to replace the term ‘treaty’ in recital B with ‘agreements between Italy and Libya on joint coastal patrols’ is absolutely unacceptable, and the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori will vote against it.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreement between Italy and Libya is much more complex: it is a treaty with precise conditions regarding more complex issues than joint coastal patrols. For the European Parliament to remain credible, it needs to call a spade a spade, even if that may be embarrassing.</p>
      <p sl="it">A separate discourse needs to be entered into for the UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, which is unable to carry out its work in Libya and is accused by the Libyan regime of incredible abuses and crimes. Are these the bases on which agreements should be conducted? We cannot deal with either terrorists or dictators. We are the European Parliament, not the board of directors of an economic giant.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Gomes for giving us the chance to debate a mandate for negotiations that is certainly thorny, as is the content of the negotiations themselves. The Tunisian example should serve as a warning that we need to proceed very cautiously, especially in the way in which we report on the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot simply notch up successes as we go through the negotiations and celebrate because a regime such as the Gaddafi regime may have agreed to certain human rights references, for example, because that regime is well-known for its major violations of all fundamental rights. What is more, all the migrants who arrive on our shores, though they are increasingly fewer in number, say in so many words that they would rather drown on the way here than go back to Libya, because of the rapes, torture, abuse, forced repatriations, mass expulsions and racist acts. It has already been said, and I will repeat it: the list of serious, mass human rights abuses of migrants in Libya is long.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So yes, of course, I think it is absolutely urgent that we do everything in our power to improve these people’s situation. This is a job for the High Commissioner for Refugees, and it is our task to resettle the individuals identified by the HCR. It is also a job for community-based organisations, which, at the moment, are extremely thin on the ground and need to be strengthened by all means possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that, if we truly want to abide by the goals we have set for our foreign policy in the Treaties, we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants staying illegally in the EU back to Libya.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, back in 2007, President Sarkozy denied any link between the release of five Bulgarian nurses from Libya and the Libyan order for French missiles worth EUR 240 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">These arms were sold to a country held responsible for the Lockerbie bombing and the supply of terrorist weapons. Yet even Gaddafi’s son suggested that there was a link between the two deals. It was arms for prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2004, the EU removed the arms embargo against Libya in exchange for migration controls. That was arms for borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, the London Times reports that Baroness Ashton suddenly wants to drop the EU arms embargo against China, which was imposed because of the massacre in Tiananmen Square, saying it is ‘a major impediment to developing stronger EU-China cooperation’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Actually, I believe it is a major impediment to saving the euro, is it not? Just like the Libyan deal, it seems the EU is so desperate now to save the euro that it is prepared to risk our collective security, as only the Chinese have enough money to rescue the euro. This is arms for bonds. Chinese foreign exchange reserves are USD 2.9 trillion. It has already bought Greek, Spanish and Portuguese bonds. However, China is also the country that bans the word ‘democracy’ from its search engines and executes thousands every year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the overthrow of the Tunisian Government has caused shock waves in neighbouring countries in the Maghreb region, which are mainly dictatorships, and also in Libya. A radical change of this kind is, of course, also an opportunity for democracy, but only when it cannot be exploited by Islamic agitators.</p>
      <p sl="de">The unrest will certainly have an impact on the influx of refugees. Therefore, it is important for us to cooperate more closely with the African countries on the refugee problem. However, Colonel Gaddafi’s call for the European Union to pay Africa at least EUR 5 billion a year to combat illegal immigration is definitely a move in the wrong direction. The countries of the European Union are already paying billions of euro in development aid. In my opinion, the aid system urgently needs to be reviewed to ensure that the aid no longer benefits dictatorships and corrupt regimes, but instead reaches the people who really need it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the plight of Christians in Islamic countries must be given a higher priority in EU foreign relations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Füle, we are responsible for all the men, women and children who seek refuge here because their lives are at risk. This responsibility is the result, on the one hand, of the moral values which Europe now represents and of the personal history of many Europeans, which is often forgotten in this context, and, on the other, of the legal guarantees given in international treaties and conventions.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we take on responsibilities, then we must also be prepared to bear the accompanying burden. This means sharing it equally between the Member States. It definitely does not mean placing the responsibility on the shoulders of a few countries whose borders happen to coincide with the external borders of the EU or, and this is the reprehensible thing which I cannot condone, paying regimes such as that of Colonel Gaddafi to relieve us of the burden.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us have no misconceptions. If we can prevent people from undertaking a dangerous journey which may put their lives at risk, this is a good thing. However, Colonel Gaddafi and his regime are not concerned with saving lives or protecting people. They are only interested in hard financial facts. The European Union should beware of becoming the accomplice of a regime which shows a complete disregard for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have visited the camps in Libya and seen what goes on there. We had the opportunity to speak with the people in charge. They are not concerned about human rights or about giving refuge to people. They complained that we had not given them any gunboats to allow them to defend their borders more effectively. We rightly have not supplied Colonel Gaddafi with any boats, because they could become dual-use items. We also have to take this into account. We must not betray our values simply because we want the economic benefits or a readmission agreement. I am also of the opinion that we should take a look at the negotiation mandate of all the Members of this House and not just a few. Secret diplomacy will not take us any further forward, particularly not following the experiences we in the European Union have had with the regime – and we cannot give it any other name – of Colonel Gaddafi. This is another point which we should not forget and I am calling on you to make sure of this. Mrs Gomes has mentioned all the criteria which must be met if we should ever reach the stage of an agreement.</p>

      <p sl="mt">It is all very well for those colleagues who do not originate from a country neighbouring Libya to criticise this agreement, but it is far more difficult for those Mediterranean countries that lie at close proximity to Libya to find a way of cooperating with this country.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this debate on Libya is taking place at a time when very significant changes are happening in another neighbouring Mediterranean country: Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have always believed that the European Union must help to promote serious reforms in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of making it an area of freedom and prosperity. I refer to my speeches in this House in recent years, in which I have repeatedly said that the Union’s policy cannot be focused on simply maintaining the status quo .</p>
      <p sl="es">This is not, however, the specific issue being debated today, which is the Framework Agreement with Libya. I would like to stress the need to cooperate with Libya in managing migratory flows, including an agreement to readmit illegal immigrants including third-country nationals, as is the case in all readmission agreements concluded by the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Giving in to Libyan positions that are contrary to this agreement would be detrimental given Libya’s important position as a transit country, and it would also send a very negative message for the negotiations with Morocco and Algeria on readmission agreements, which have been in deadlock for many years.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, we do also have to insist that the Libyan authorities respect the rights of refugees, including – as has already been said – the principle of non-refoulement.</p>

Despite all its contradictions – I was in Libya with Mrs Gomes – there is no doubt that a framework agreement could certainly make a contribution to the fight against terrorism, to fundamental freedoms and to the energy issue.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank the Members of Parliament for their remarks. I will send the rapporteur, Ms Gomes, more details of national indicative plans for the years 2011-2013, showing EUR 60 million being provided for our programmes in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am fully aware that certain topics are problematic in relations with Libya. Nonetheless, the European Union has taken the option of building relations with Libya in order to be able to address all issues in an open and constructive manner, including very sensitive ones like human rights, the respect for fundamental freedoms and the rights of migrants.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year, I visited the detention centre in the Libyan Desert with Cecilia Malmström. I have absolutely no illusions about the challenges we face. I also had the opportunity to understand what the alternatives are to our engagement in the field of migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me add a third, personal remark: we are not rewarding anyone with these negotiations; we are taking care of our interests in accordance with the values we believe in. Libya has shown its strong will to deepen relations with the European Union. We consider that this is positive and that the European Union should continue to pursue the policy of engagement.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who have participated in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this debate highlights the dilemmas we face. From my own visit to Libya, as part of the delegation led by our colleague, Mr Panzeri, in November 2010, I came to the conclusion that we have to pursue the line of engagement. We recognise that we have to deal with a difficult interlocutor, but it would be unconscionable not to pursue that line because there are humanitarian obligations towards the people who are suffering so much in Libya, in particular, the migrants who are going through Libya and enduring the situation there.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that many of the difficulties are due to the fact that this regime is isolated. Despite the difficulties, and despite having no illusions that we will achieve an agreement soon or that all the conditions that we put forward will be met, we need to pursue that line. In my opinion, this is clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, in that sense, having the EU delegation established in Tripoli is extremely important because I think that – as many have said here – what is happening in Tunisia now is bound to have repercussions in Libya, despite the differences. In Libya, we are not dealing with a similar situation in many respects because of the total dependency of the people on income from oil.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, I think that the message is that, despite our different perceptions at this stage, we are committed to following closely the negotiations by the Commission. I am grateful for the briefings we have had and which have been useful. We will follow them very closely and will be able to make recommendations at any time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that through the very wide consensus achieved with the collaboration of my shadow rapporteurs and everybody, we are conveying a very clear message to the Council and to the Commission, which has the task of negotiation, but also to our Libyan interlocutors, on what points we believe are absolutely essential to be met if we are to achieve the improvements that we want to see in the bilateral relations, and also on the crucial question of respect for human rights in Libya.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have agreed in the European Parliament that we want a common European asylum system to be in place by 2012. This also involves having the same or similar conditions in all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the implementation of the system has met with resistance and that is primarily due to the fact that during the discussions on the asylum package, we were given inadequate information, sometimes no information at all, or even conflicting information. We had very little data as the basis for the financial estimates relating to the Procedures Directive and the costs in the Member States. Our aim is to call on the Commission to provide Parliament with a study or with the necessary information. This concerns areas such as the interpreting service and also legal advice. It is not clear what effects this will actually have in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, during the process of revising the Procedures Directive, it has become clear that we can produce a high quality, fast procedure which is of benefit to both sides, because it helps decisions to be made quickly so that the situation is clear to people and there is a low error rate. Our objective as liberals is to give the Commission our complete support for its plans. However, we need arguments, including in the discussions with the Member States, which will demonstrate the effects of the revision of this asylum package and, in particular, the Procedures Directive. For this reason, we are calling on the Commission to give us genuine support to ensure that this asylum package becomes reality by 2012, so that we can establish a common European asylum system.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is important that the EU comes to grips with the problems of migration and the right of asylum. The Commission has submitted proposals in this area. However, there is currently no accurate analysis of the implementation of existing legal provisions. There are also hardly any detailed calculations and analyses concerning the new proposals. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports the right of asylum and the right to protection for people who need it.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, when we look at the actual situation, it is unfortunately clear that people are applying for asylum for very different reasons or even systematically abusing the system. The right of asylum and subsidiary protection is not a tool for general migration into the 27 Member States. We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people’s fates as a result of our right of asylum.</p>
      <p sl="de">Asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care. Victims of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the EU. This is why the Commission’s obligations in this respect are laid down in the new drafts. I think many of them are appropriate, including interpreters, proper healthcare and taking into consideration special protection needs.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would also like to mention the points which I believe are problematic. The authorities in the Member States are being given far too few opportunities to prevent abuse. The option of the accelerated procedure and the border procedure should be restricted by applying charges. If an applicant commits a serious breach of his duty of cooperation, there are very few possibilities of imposing sanctions. On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion. If he reappears, he is offered an extended range of procedural options. Even if an application is obviously without any foundation, the use of the accelerated procedure will only be possible after the second subsequent application. This will lead to significant cost increases.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current Commission draft states that free legal advice will be available from a lawyer, which will also result in the Member States’ costs rising considerably. I would simply like the Commission to reconsider the practical consequences of its proposals, the financial impact and the problems for the authorities in the Member States. We want to see a system with high standards, but it must be workable and should not present already overburdened Member States with completely impossible tasks.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all, I would like to point out that I think one of the issues for this debate is the establishment of a common European asylum system by 2012, which will finally allow us to stop adding to the worst national practices on asylum.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not lose sight of this, as it means we need to move towards greater harmonisation, based on common rules. Indeed, I believe that practical cooperation alone will not resolve the current discrepancies between the national asylum systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like, if I may, to express my concern about the state of play regarding the common European asylum system, in view of the many hold-ups within the Council. The future of this complex undertaking is by no means clear. We only need to look at the Commission’s attempt to salvage the situation with its forthcoming proposal for recasting two directives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Against this background, then, we need to talk about costs, since that is what our debate is focusing on today. What we are hearing is that firmer procedural guarantees will considerably increase the financial burden on Member States of examining asylum claims, which they will find even more difficult given the state of their budgets in the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I repeat, it is inefficient, shoddy procedures that are more costly for Member States. I believe that a front-loading approach, as advocated by the Commission in its recast proposal, in other words, improving the first-instance procedures, will allow us to make real economies of scale in the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why? Because from the outset, these harmonised procedures will help the authorities to identify bogus applications more easily and will provide clearer guidelines for the grounds for decisions. This will allow the right decisions to be made and made more quickly, which will then reduce both the length of the procedure and the number of decisions appealed against and overturned by the courts, and will hence reduce the costs of detention and, ultimately, the overall costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, if we want to talk about the issue of costs, why not also talk about the Dublin Eurodac system? Why have none of the Member States ventured to ask for a cost-effectiveness report on the application of this system? What we do know is that some appalling human consequences are not being matched by any evaluations backed by convincing evidence, both regarding actual transfers and regarding the prevention of secondary movements or multiple claims, even though these are the very reasons why the Dublin system was created. Let us talk about costs therefore since we must, but let us look at the system as a whole, including the costs of the Dublin system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From my point of view as rapporteur on the Asylum Procedures Directive, I believe that the level of harmonisation as it stands is inadequate and is detrimental to the quality and efficiency of the process. These deficiencies take their toll both on Member States and on the victims of persecution. We are still aiming for 2012, but we must not feel we have to rush through a text based on lowest common denominators purely for the sake of sticking to deadlines. What we need are fair, accessible and effective procedures, and this will remain my goal and that of my political group in this debate in any event.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think the aim of this discussion is to get the Council to finally show its hand, because I have to say that given such an ambitious, not to mention necessary, reform package on asylum, it is unbelievable that all we are getting are snippets of information, some contradictory, as to what is holding the Council up on these proposals that have been on the table for a long time now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are getting a vague idea that the Council or the Member States may be stalling because of costs, but it is not even clear what is meant by this. Are they talking about human costs, political costs or financial costs? These different costs are sometimes linked in any case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One thing is for certain: there are instances of unsatisfactory practices and inadequate protection in Europe at the moment. In the first place, it is not true that Europe shoulders all the world’s problems. For example, in 2007, I think Europe took in only 14% of the world’s refugees. In the second place, some of the existing practices are utterly unacceptable. I am thinking of instances such as phallometric testing in the Czech Republic, right here in Europe, or the documents of the Committee against Torture, which brought to light many cases such as forced repatriation without the right to appeal or based on hurried-through procedures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think we can certainly talk about costs: for example, we could talk about the cost of expelling migrants, which is very costly: the French Senate says that it costs EUR 20 000 per person expelled. Above all, we can talk about how we might improve the situation. There are certainly questions to be asked as to how we can improve the first-instance decision-making process, as Mrs Guillaume has done in her report, when roughly 50% of first-instance decisions are overturned on appeal. There are clearly very substantial economies to be made in terms of financial, human and political costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We might take another look at the aberrations of the Dublin Convention, and I think the Council should look very carefully at these, because they also represent very substantial costs both in human and in financial terms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, and I will end here, one thing that is very expensive is detention, as the Parliamentary study confirms. The cost of detaining asylum seekers is prohibitive. This needs to be said, people need to be told and it needs to be discussed in the Council. This is absolutely urgent.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, sometimes we are the victim of our own working methods. If we had had just one asylum directive regulating the procedures, assessment criteria and reception, we would have had only two options: either to adopt the directive, with or without amendments, or face the failure of the negotiations. Such a scenario would have enabled us in the European Parliament to say ‘no’ to a common asylum policy and ‘no’ to a system modelled on the Dublin Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the reality is different. We have a whole range of directives. The Council has the option of giving priority to one directive, while considering another too controversial. Before long, we will end up in a situation where we will, indeed, be able to negotiate a new Dublin Regulation, but still have reached no agreement over asylum procedures or reception, for example. Let us think through what the implications of that might be. If that were to happen, we would be making Member States responsible for examining asylum applications, without having any guarantee that those applications would be properly examined or asylum seekers taken care of in a humane way. I find that totally unacceptable, especially given the current situation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore have this question for the Council and the Commission: how are you going to ensure that you rescue the Asylum Procedures Directive from the doldrums without sacrificing quality? You will soon receive a number of proposals from Parliament on how the directive might be improved. Will you try to convey to Member States the clear signal which the MEPs have sent out and will you dig your heels in, should Member States insist on an à la carte approach?</p>
      <p sl="nl">By way of conclusion, I would like to clarify one point. I made no reference in my question to the costs of the asylum procedure. I omitted them, not because I was unaware of that issue, but because humane treatment of asylum seekers is paramount for me. That requires a neat process and proper arrangements for reception. If we fail to regulate that properly, then I will no longer have any desire to work on the other sub-initiatives. I hope that I have the full support of the European Commission on this, in particular.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President, for your kind words. Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I would like to thank Parliament for giving me the opportunity to talk about the very important issue of asylum application procedures this evening.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Parliament addressed five questions to the Council, and since they all deal with the Commission’s proposal for a recast of the Asylum Procedures Directive, I suggest we debate these five questions as one.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In your questions, you referred to the September 2010 Commission report on the application of the Asylum Procedures Directive. This report confirms that considerable differences continue to exist between Member States in terms of asylum procedures and procedural guarantees. The Council and the European Parliament agree that this does not conform to our mutually accepted goal of creating a common European asylum system. In October 2008, the European Council adopted the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which stressed that the EU and its Member States are committed to addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by migration and asylum in a fair, effective and coherent way.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Among other things, the Pact contains a specific commitment to taking the necessary initiatives for completing the establishment of a common European asylum system. The European Council therefore invited the Commission to submit proposals for the creation of a single asylum procedure containing common norms.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Stockholm Programme also set out clearly that, in the context of the creation of a common European asylum system, increased harmonisation must remain one of the fundamental policy objectives of the EU. After the European Council had thus given the process political impetus, the Commission submitted multiple proposals in the field of asylum policy, both in 2008 and 2009: Eurodac, as you mentioned earlier in the introductory debate, the proposal for the amendment of the Dublin Regulation or the proposal for the amendment of the Reception Conditions Directive; similarly, the proposal for the establishment of a European Asylum Support Office; and lastly, the proposal for the amendment of the Asylum Procedures Directive and the Qualification Directive.</p>
      <p sl="hu">After these had been received from the Commission, the Council immediately set to work. In this stage, the Council and its preparatory bodies subjected all proposals to intensive and meticulous examination. To this date, the only proposal that Parliament and the Council managed to adopt out of these was the Regulation establishing a European Asylum Support Office, and I am pleased that the Office will soon commence its operation. Last year, Parliament and the Council also agreed on the amendment of the Long-Term Residents Directive, which I believe will give significant momentum to further work on a common European asylum system.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Unfortunately, as you are absolutely right to complain, progress in other areas has proven more difficult. I am certain that you are fully aware of the political sensitivity and technical difficulties of the issue. In this we, the Council, and, I believe, Parliament as well, will all need more time. As you have very accurately pointed out in the questions submitted, the proposal for a recast of the Asylum Procedures Directive contains a particularly high number of problematic issues. Parliament, too, is in the progress of forming its position, which is a good indication of the complexity of the process. It is clear that there remain considerable concerns within the Council with regard to several issues related to the proposal. These especially concern the issue of the potential effects of the proposed measures on the costs of national asylum procedures and the effectiveness of such procedures. You have yourselves mentioned earlier this evening that we must indeed pay special attention to effectiveness and costs. The Member States firmly support the harmonisation objectives with a view to reaching an agreement on certain common fundamental norms and values and uniform protection criteria. As such, the Member States are committed to fully respecting asylum seekers’ right to protection.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, the Member States wish to make their systems sustainable, especially considering the current difficult economic situation. In order to achieve this, the guarantees provided to asylum seekers and the rules, which must be effective and enforceable and must not result in increased administrative or financial burdens, must be balanced. The Council in general is convinced that if we fail to strike an appropriate balance in this regard, those who do not need protection at all, as Mrs Hohlmeier has already mentioned, will be motivated to abuse the asylum system. Such abuse may harm those asylum seekers who are in real need of protection and, in the long term, could jeopardise the issue of asylum in the European Union. In this context, the Commission’s announcement that it intends to submit an amended proposal has gained extensive support in the Council, as I think the Commissioner will elaborate shortly.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am certain that this new proposal will give new momentum to the debate in the Council, ensuring that this new proposal will reflect the opinions of the Council and Parliament as well. We will thus be able to make progress in the matter of the proposal on asylum procedures, which is, as you have correctly pointed out in the questions submitted, an important element of the asylum package. To this I must add that, in response to the Commission’s announcement, the Member States have firmly expressed their readiness to lend their assistance to the Commission in drawing up the new proposal.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In this context, please allow me to point out one more aspect. A more accurate estimation of the costs of examining the applications submitted would be facilitated if we had such an estimate, which would enable us to conduct an appropriate debate in the Council. I must unfortunately inform you that we in the Council possess no such information. In accordance with the Treaties, the examination of asylum applications falls under the competence of the Member States. The collection and ordering of information relating to the costs of examining asylum applications is not a task the Treaties confer upon the Council. Therefore, as a representative of the Council, I cannot make a commitment in this debate, either speaking for myself or on behalf of the Council, to make available the information in question. However, the Council, of course, remains committed to continuing its work on the proposal for the amendment of the Asylum Procedures Directive, and I would like to thank you for the work you have done so far, and I am confident that the Commission will incorporate the observations you have made so far in the new proposal.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are counting on the commitment and expertise of the European Parliament. The Hungarian Presidency is confident that, through proper cooperation, we will be able to make progress in this area as well. Please note that it is the goal of the Hungarian Presidency to prepare the common European asylum system that is scheduled to be created in 2012. You, too, have mentioned here several laws in connection with which we definitely wish to make progress. We intend to reach a political agreement in the discussion on the Qualification Directive, as well as in the field of the Dublin Regulation, before the end of the Hungarian Presidency. We will do everything in our power to increase harmony between Parliament and the Council on issues related to the procedure as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Asylum Procedures Directive is an essential element of the common European asylum system. It is the aim of the Commission to establish a system that is balanced, fair, efficient and cost-effective. Financial impact is a critical aspect of every Commission proposal and is assessed thoroughly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission carried out extensive research at the time of the preparation of the Asylum Procedures Directive proposal, in line with the requirements on impact assessment. The evaluation of financial impact was mainly based on statistical information and data obtained from Member States through the comprehensive questionnaires sent out by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only a few Member States could identify the full cost of asylum procedures. Others provided certain elements, mainly on the costs of legal assistance and interpretation. The Commission assessed financial implications on the basis of the available information.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission concluded that given, inter alia , the aim of reducing costs, an approach based on front-loading was to be preferred: i.e. investing resources in the early stages of the asylum procedure in order to make it faster, more efficient and fairer. Additional investments in the first-instance procedure improve the efficiency of the asylum process. Such investments are offset due to savings at the appeal stages and a reduction in overall reception costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The choice of this approach was fully supported by the findings of a recent project in the UK, the so-called ‘Solihull Pilot’, presented at the ministerial conference on asylum in 2010. This project confirmed the hypothesis that front-loading the asylum process – in particular, by providing access to competent legal advice for asylum applicants at the start of the procedure and allowing the legal representative to interact with the decision maker – leads to significant improvements in the quality of first-instance decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It resulted in much quicker decisions and a higher percentage of positive decisions at first instance, fewer appeals and a higher percentage of removals to countries of origin. It was possible to reduce considerably expenditure on appeals and on accommodation and welfare. These savings considerably outweighed the additional legal aid costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to remind you of the recent study, prepared by the European Parliament, on burden sharing between Member States for the reception of asylum seekers, which provides an analysis of costs of asylum procedures and reception, including legal aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, the Commission has paid considerable attention to the cost element as part of the impact assessment. The findings have been confirmed by empirical evidence and the information has been complemented by the European Parliament study. Therefore, the Commission does not intend to prepare another study on costs. However, during the next stages of the negotiations on the Asylum Procedures Directive, the Commission will continue to be attentive to the cost aspects.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is no question but that the asylum package is currently blocked and this is a pity. It is an unfortunate situation and we should all do our best to unblock the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can think of many reasons why the situation is blocked. First of all, we seem to have concentrated on new proposals when we all know that there is existing legislation which Member States are struggling to implement – and this has created an ill-at-ease feeling amongst Member States, because they are clearly not prepared to move on to new laws when they have difficulties with existing ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the new proposals feature and envisage new and much higher obligations and burdens which are, at times, unrealistic, especially in the current context, and which could also, as has been highlighted already, lead to abuse that should be avoided.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, there is indeed a lack of a financial assessment, of a study to determine costs, and I am afraid I have to disagree with you, Commissioner: I do not think that the study carried out by the European Parliament on burden sharing is about the costs of these proposals. In any case, it is a job for the Commission to study the financial implications of its own proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, there is no proposal on a proper, legally binding burden-sharing mechanism and this, too, creates difficulties for a number of Member States, and indeed for this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Council is still stonewalling on proposals such as the review of the Dublin Regulation. I am very happy to hear the Council say that the Presidency will pay close attention to this and increase the efforts to find a solution on the Dublin dossier.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is difficult. We are in a difficult situation and we need to get out of it. The EPP Group is still very much open to cooperating with the Council, and most importantly with other groups here in Parliament, to try and reach a compromise that is acceptable for all.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, all of the EU’s institutions have a deadline of 2012 when the common European asylum system is to be ready. I have to admit that I have a feeling of both hope and despair about this. Will we manage to do this or not? It is based on a common system for the reception of asylum seekers, the examination of applications and decisions concerning these people’s futures. Once we have this system in place, it will be the same in all countries, which is not the case today. There are currently huge differences with regard to how people are received in our various Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">From the report that Commissioner Füle just referred to, we know that it is a fact that there are large differences in how the Member States receive asylum seekers. We also know that the costs decrease when we increase the quality of the first instance decisions. We are currently working on amending the Procedures Directive, and it would therefore be very important for us in Parliament to be aware of the specific costs for different Member States when it comes to the asylum procedure.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I believe that, by carrying out thorough examinations, we will reduce the risk of mistakes being made and people getting into difficulties. It will be interesting to see whether the Commission can come up with a more thorough procedure and demonstrate how we can reduce the costs of the reception of asylum seekers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the end of the day, this will perhaps be the decisive argument that Mr Busuttil referred to, in other words, the key to unblocking the situation with regard to the fixed positions that we see the Council taking. I deeply regret the fact that the Council is so closed in this process.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have been visited today by the Hungarian Prime Minister, who has taken over the Council Presidency, and I would now ask the Hungarian Presidency to continue the good work that was started while Belgium held the Presidency. It would be unfortunate if this process should cease. Together, we can indeed develop an operational asylum system that has humanity and consideration for our fellow man as key concepts, and we can do this by 2012. Let us continue to hope and work towards this being possible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I think that there is always an implication in these discussions that humanitarian action is expensive, so we do not take humanitarian action because it is expensive, but this implication also has an interesting correlation: we would take humanitarian action if it was not expensive. Well, it happens that there are cases where a humanitarian policy is a cheaper policy. A recent study from the British House of Commons proves this point exactly: a system that allows a rapid response to asylum seekers is very much cheaper, and delay and the forced removal of families is also more expensive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are only talking about administrative costs, without counting the costs for the asylum seekers themselves, both those who are entitled to asylum and those whose claims are ultimately denied for the right or wrong reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The question, then, is: if we can take humanitarian action, fulfil our moral duties and do so more cheaply, why are we not doing it? The EU does not have a concerted plan of action, nor does it have a common plan of action, and I take the liberty here of disagreeing with Mr Busuttil: it is not because the implementation of current legislation is expensive for the Member States, but because this implementation is partial and incomplete. At the moment, we have a policy that is solely repressive and ends up being unfair to asylum seekers, the authorities and, ultimately, as we are now discovering, European taxpayers, too.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would ask the Council to let us have up-to-date information and to answer these questions so that we can finally progress towards a consistent and concerted policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate is a result of the implementation of the common immigration and asylum system enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. Member States lose even more control of their own destinies while having to pay the – as yet unknown – cost for the privilege.</p>
      <p sl="en">Britain’s asylum system is already a mess, with thousands upon thousands of cases pending and applicants simply lost and gone to ground. The whole system is essentially a racket for those not eligible for legitimate immigration. I realise that I am wasting my breath in speaking about this here, since most of you could not care less about preserving the democratic powers of the nation state. Most of you are entranced in a grotesque fantasy world of endless EU integration, like characters in some kind of painting by Hieronymus Bosch, but the British people will one day hold to account the treasonous and treacherous politicians in Britain who made this possible by denying them a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the aim is to standardise the right to asylum within the EU by 2012. However, it is unclear whether we will still be able to make use of rapid deportation in transit zones, for example, which has proved its worth in Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has rejected the plan to abandon this airport regulation with cryptic statements which indicate that it will still be possible in future to turn away asylum seekers at the border, if they come from a safe country.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are all familiar with the debate about what is a safe country and opinions about this differ widely within Europe. The plan is also to give siblings the right to stay, which previously only applied to parents and married couples, and to extend the right to medical treatment. I do not even want to start discussing the proposals that asylum seekers should be brought into line with the relevant country’s social security system.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I very much doubt that these proposals will reduce the costs of the procedure. I also doubt that there will be less red tape. I believe that the burdens on the Member States will be greater and that asylum law will be relaxed, which will ultimately lead to an increased influx of migrants.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that this directive on procedures is particularly important. Once refugee status has been rigorously ascertained, it means the recognition process should be quick and smooth and that, frankly, has not been the case.</p>
      <p sl="it">While the asylum package, which should define a new, more up-to-date frame of reference, is stuck in the Council, a different view has emerged in the Member States regarding the effectiveness of the asylum procedures based on the rules already in force. I say to the Commissioner and the President-in-Office that you cannot invoke the crisis to reduce the funding needed for an important procedure, or other arguments that I do not find wholly convincing regarding a procedure that is currently stalled.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is fair that people who cannot remain in their own country for documented political, religious or other reasons should have the right to be received in the Member States, just as it is equally necessary to deny the right to be received if someone claiming to be a refugee actually is not one. It is true; the Stockholm Programme has strongly stated this principle: 250 000 applications have been made in the last two years, which is a large number, although lower in the last reference year. What is needed is advice, probably interpreting, lower costs and a balanced sharing of the burdens.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is needed is probably for the support offices to work better and harder – we rely on the one in Malta – and for the European Union to really want to take a decisive step forward, to guarantee refugees their rights but, at the same time, to allow only those entitled to be classed as refugees to enter the EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as my colleague, Mrs Guillaume, said, this is a crucial moment in the development of the European asylum system. We have had some real progress in some parts of the package – including, during the Belgian Presidency, my own report on beneficiaries of international protection – but clearly these are just the side elements of the asylum package. It must be stressed today that the procedures recast forms the backbone of the package.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore essential that we move forward on this recast in view of the rapidly approaching 2012 deadline for the creation of the common European asylum system. One of the recurring criticisms by Member States of the proposed recast of procedures is that it will lead to an unnecessary financial burden on them, but there is a significant body of evidence – and I pay tribute to what the Commission said on the Solihull project in the United Kingdom – that front-loading asylum procedures leads to better decisions at first instance; quality decision making is a key element which we must not miss. We therefore want more information from Member States backing up their claims.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would like to stress that this debate should not just be about costs. As Mr de Jong said, the procedures recast is about harmonising practices and raising standards across the EU. It is clear that standards vary too much between Member States and the current legal framework needs revising. We know the Commission is going to come forward with a revised recast proposal in the coming months in view of the opposition of the Council. Parliament should put forward a strong position on this matter to ensure that the Commission does not water down its original proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The right to legal assistance, a guarantee of personal interview, limitations on the use of accelerated procedures; all of these safeguards are essential to a fair and effective asylum system. This goal of achieving a common European asylum system is not a goal that Parliament set; we all remember in 1999, in Tampere, that it was the Council that set these goals; they reset these goals at The Hague and at Stockholm, so let us revise our history and understand that we depend on the Council to unblock the system and we will work cooperatively with the Hungarian Presidency to try and maintain the momentum of the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is what so many of the Members across the party divide want to see; we may want to see different outcomes but we will cooperate, and let us hope in the Hungarian Presidency we can see some genuine progress.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in 2012, we urgently need a common asylum policy. The report presented by the Commission on 8 September highlights the numerous obstacles that the Member States encounter when seeking to achieve the objectives of Directive 2005/85/EC.</p>
      <p sl="es">Asylum seekers’ right to legal aid applies at different levels. Many Member States invoke the directive in providing legal assistance at the appeal stage, while others grant that right during both the application process and at second instance.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some Member States require proof of merit in order to decide whether or not free legal assistance is granted at the appeal stage. In the majority of cases, there are major differences regarding the deadlines for appealing, while the applicability of the automatic suspension of the effects of refusals also presents difficulties, as it only applies in six Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">These differences demonstrate that the directive must be reviewed. In reviewing it, the Commission stresses the need to focus efforts on the initial phase of the procedure, in order to be more effective in differentiating which people have a right to protection. According to the Commission, this measure will help to save significant interpreting and legal assistance costs at second instance.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the proposal is not accompanied by a detailed study of what the interpreting and legal assistance costs would be at first instance, nor of the costs that the Member States actually incur currently when applying the European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, the Commission needs to provide information as to the actual costs relating to its proposal to focus efforts, and I do not think that the refusal that I have just heard from the Commission is acceptable. I sincerely believe that this is unacceptable and that it needs to be reconsidered or qualified.</p>

Although some of your competences are not those that have been mentioned here, the Presidency can act to ensure that the Commission has all the information it needs on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are aware of how difficult it is for the Commission and the Council to collect this data, as there are Member States that are not prepared to provide it, perhaps because they have not conducted a study as to the consequences of improving the procedures for deciding on refugee or international protection status. Perhaps the Member States do not consider that standardising these procedures would improve the quality of the first period – as has been said here today – and would reduce the number of appeals currently being lodged that have to be managed by the Member States that receive asylum applications today.</p>
      <p sl="es">Perhaps this has not been highlighted sufficiently. The effect of the diverse range of procedures is that some Member States cope better than others with asylum applications. By improving these procedures, the Commission’s proposal would avoid the use of a significant amount of resources and secondary movements and therefore, the cost of the common asylum system would be less by standardising the procedures and avoiding hosting costs.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are not only talking about the cost of these procedures but, more importantly and essentially, about the cost of not having a common asylum system. We currently have several thousand asylum applicants at Europe’s borders from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and states that have collapsed or are out of control, such as Somalia or Sudan. When we talk about these costs, we do not take into account the human costs of keeping the applicants in detention centres for several months without the necessary guarantees, or even the guarantees that our criminals have, and with no assistance whatsoever, while the refugee commissions decide whether or not to grant them status and what type. Neither do we take into account the human costs of those who have subsidiary protection for years and remain in the camps when their only crime is having fled wars and arrived on boats, and being obliged to give their fingerprints. Their crime is not having had the money to catch a plane and present themselves at the airports.</p>
      <p sl="es">Has the Council considered that making these procedures quicker would prevent not only these tragedies, but also the cost to some Member States of maintaining that situation?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I wish to start by congratulating the authors of this question, and specifically, my colleague, Mrs Hohlmeier, and I am very much in agreement with what Mr Díaz de Mera has just said. We know that this is only one of the five instruments that deal with the bases of the European asylum system. It deals with the minimum standards applicable to asylum procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report that the Commission presented to us last year, however, recognises that the Member States have adopted divergent practices and that considerable variation exists between the procedural guarantees provided in each Member State. There are significant disparities between the Member States, ranging from the provisions relating to accelerated procedures to those relating to personal interviews, assistance and access to an effective appeals procedure.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us be clear: some Member States have transposed this directive incorrectly or incompletely and others simply apply it not very strictly. We have two options: either we abandon having a European asylum system or we have to eliminate these procedural differences. We have to introduce improvements, that is to say, the improvements that appear necessary, in particular, improving the quality of the examination of applications, known as front loading. Therefore, the assessment that we are asking of the Commission is necessary. It is necessary to identify where and what we can improve and to remedy these differences. We are aware that the Commission needs the cooperation of the Member States, in particular, to provide for the necessary training, including, but not exclusively, in terms of costs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us be clear: the European institutions and the Member States have to cooperate on this objective. Our objective must continue to be the same: that the common asylum system can be a reality in 2012.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, just today, the German Government announced its decision to stop returning refugees to Greece for the next twelve months. Similar decisions have been taken by Sweden, Great Britain, Iceland and Norway. However, just a few months ago, in November last year, the Council of Ministers of Justice rejected the inclusion of a mechanism to suspend the transfer of asylum seekers to the revised Dublin II Regulation, as proposed by the Commission since 2008, considering that Dublin II is fine and that there is no problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, we hope – rightly so and we need to do this in the directive we are debating today – to provide free legal support for asylum seekers in the first stage of the examination of their application. However, we know full well – as Mrs Hohlmeier also said earlier – that these procedures are often abused by asylum seekers, in order to use legal tricks to extend their stay in Europe, even though they are not entitled to do so. All this is with no clear evaluation of the cost of such a measure and whether the cost will subsequently undermine its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I wonder, with such contradictory decisions, how we shall manage to complete a viable common asylum system by 2012, when we ourselves are passing different decisions, making different proposals and ultimately taking different action and achieving different results in practice. Is this happening due to weakness, due to a lack of solidarity or for some other reason which the Council and Commission can elucidate for us?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not wish to sing out of tune, but I strongly believe that the correlation, including from a semantic point of view, which I have heard from various groups, in other words, the relationship between savings and the right to asylum, is, in my view, a negative correlation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let me explain myself better, even though I only have a few seconds: I strongly believe that, even if administration costs are reduced, they will be fictitious costs. The real issue is harmonisation, but it is not an ideological issue but primarily a cultural one. Unfortunately, there are cultural approaches, I repeat, to this issue and not ideological ones. That is what we must address.</p>
      <p sl="it">The most exposed countries are the Mediterranean states, which have a much stronger culture of receiving people than other countries because we have a much closer connection with this issue. While spending on this has risen in Italy, because it has now reached EUR 30 million, other countries want to reduce it. I do not believe that.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also have to be careful to put a fifth of this spending – while we are talking about these things – down to disability issues, because political refugees very often have disabilities because they have been tortured; and we must also talk about protection and protected people, who are another matter, but a group to be received. I have not heard about the protection of these people that we have to receive.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall finish by saying that the Europe of freedoms, the Europe of the protection of rights …</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I, too, feel it is important to recast Directive 2005/85/EC as the process for establishing minimum standards on asylum procedures must be fairer and more efficient. The purpose of the amending proposal is to simplify and enhance the procedures at EU level. The standards envisaged must be based on the best practices identified throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although all Member States officially grant the right to apply for asylum, problems occur with the national access systems. They vary significantly in their present form from one country to another. This results in a number of administrative problems which need to be resolved using a common approach. I also ask the Council to provide as much information as possible about the current situation in Member States. It is important for us to resume the negotiations on this dossier and to achieve a result by the specified deadline.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly. I have a request for you, Mr Füle. I would like to start by saying that incorrect assumptions lead to incorrect cost estimates. At the moment, the number of asylum seekers is not falling, but rising significantly. This is a result of visa facilitation, for example, for Serbia and Macedonia. We are currently also seeing a massive increase in abuses of the asylum system as part of attempts to enter countries in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures. However, that is not the case. If overall standards are raised, the consequence will be cost increases. Improving the standard of quality for everyone and making the procedures more complex will, in reality, result in increased costs. I am more than happy to discuss this point. Therefore, I would like to ask you specifically to take the concerns of the countries seriously, because some of the practical reports from the countries have already been completed and will be distributed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have listened carefully to the views expressed by Members of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Asylum Procedures Directive is an essential element of the common European asylum system that will need to be established before the end of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the commitment of the European Parliament to proceed with the negotiations on the Asylum Procedures Directive. As regards the negotiations in the Council, the Commission appreciates the commitment of the Member States to discuss the proposal in an open and constructive manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several elements of the proposal proved, nevertheless, to be difficult indeed. Thus, to facilitate the adoption of the directive, the Commission intends to adopt a modified proposal before the start of the Polish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s overall objective regarding this directive is to progress towards a common procedure and to facilitate more consistent and efficient application of procedural standards. The modified proposal will continue to promote respect for fundamental rights and high quality decision making at first instance, which will result in solid decisions and faster conclusions of procedures, hence, leading to a reduction of costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the modified proposal, the Commission will aim to simplify certain provisions with a view to facilitating their application. The Commission will continue to endeavour to ensure proper balance between fairness and efficiency of procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning specifically the financial impacts, the Commission fully understands the importance attached to the cost-related elements of this proposal, and will continue to be attentive to the cost aspects during the next stages of the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me close by stressing that the opinion of the European Parliament is, of course, a key benchmark which will allow the Commission to take into account Parliament’s position when preparing the modified proposal. We will continue to work with Parliament and the Council towards progress on this proposal within the context of the wider asylum package.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this valuable debate. I also thank you for enabling us to discuss concrete facts, and I am confident that this will contribute to the new Commission proposal taking these considerations into account. We talked about establishing common minimum criteria, about the elimination of bad practices through a single system, about being efficient and cost-effective, and about preventing opportunities for abuse. I believe that these are all very important ideas, concerning which we will need to work together.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Please allow me one final thought. We are all proud to be part of a community, here in the European Union, which counts human dignity among its most important values. And asylum policy is a matter where the supremacy of human dignity is our primary guiding principle. The Hungarian Presidency considers the human factor to be the most important consideration in all EU policies. Prime Minister Orbán said this morning that, even though the current situation of the European Union calls for a clear mind and a cool head, we must also demonstrate that we have a heart. He stated this in connection with the Roma policy. I believe that we must also assert this in connection with asylum policy: yes, the EU must be able to demonstrate that it also has a heart.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Hungarian Presidency will carry on the work of its Belgian predecessor. In our programme, in this green booklet which all Members received in the mail yesterday, you will find on page 25 that our priorities in relation to the Justice and Home Affairs Council include the common European asylum system. In my first speech this evening, I also explained, more specifically than it is described in the booklet, that we intend to reach an agreement within the Council on both the Dublin Regulation and the Qualification Directive. I therefore trust that, on the basis of what has been said, you will recognise that the Hungarian Presidency is indeed treating this as a priority issue, and we will be counting on your cooperation.</p>
