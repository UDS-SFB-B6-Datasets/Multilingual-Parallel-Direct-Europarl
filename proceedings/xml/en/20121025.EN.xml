      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a privilege to present the report on the 20 main concerns of European citizens and business with the functioning of the Single Market, particularly in this debate with Commissioner Barnier, on the 20th anniversary of that market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">First, a word of thanks to fellow Members of all the political groups and, in particular, to the rapporteurs for opinion and shadow rapporteurs for such constructive contributions and such a positive approach. It was a pleasure to work with them all and the report was much enhanced by our combined efforts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are very aware and proud that, throughout these 20 years, the single market has been the driver of significant economic and employment opportunities in Europe that have transformed the life of European citizens and businesses. Travelling, residing and working throughout the Union are freedoms that are within the reach of all citizens of the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For European consumers, the single market means greater freedom of choice and lower prices. For our businesses, the single market means more business opportunities with access to 500 million consumers, which means greater economic growth and more job creation. In order to illustrate the progress that the single market brought about in Europe since it was set up in 1992 until the beginning of the crisis in 2008, we need only consider the 2.7 million jobs created and the 2.13 % growth in GDP. Today it is 13 % cheaper to make or receive a telephone call whilst travelling in Europe than it was in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Freedom of movement of persons is most eloquently expressed in the Erasmus programme. More than 2.5 million students have benefited from this European programme for educational exchange and mobility. In the past 5 years, businesses have also benefited from a 25 % reduction in administrative charges thanks to single market legislation. But we have to ask: is all well in the single market? No, it is not all running smoothly. The economic and financial crisis we are experiencing has had a negative impact on the operation of the market. Our citizens, who, in some countries, are in the crisis of unemployment and austerity measures, have begun to take a sceptical view of Europe and a negative view as regards the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">People do not yet know or do not sufficiently understand their rights and do not know where to find information or assistance. On the other hand, many Member States are taking an unreasonable time to transpose European directives and legislation on the single market, thus compromising its full potential.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In certain areas of everyday life such simple things as, for example, the reimbursement of medical expenses following a temporary stay in another EU country, the opening of a bank account by a student on the Erasmus programme, changing energy provider, transferring retirement pensions, the recognition of qualifications and registering a vehicle in another Member State, are still very complex, difficult or onerous procedures. It is important to respond to these problems. That was my concern as rapporteur. Therefore, the message conveyed in the report is very clear: greater political will is required, much greater political will on the part of the Member States and the European institutions, the Council – above all the Council and the Commission – to govern better together; it is essential to regain the confidence of people and businesses and to make it easier for them to exercise their rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the European Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, for having presented the ‘Single Market Act II: twelve priority actions for new growth’ which, I am certain, marks a new stage for the future.</p>

    <intervention id="4-018-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss the single market there is one thing we should remember, which is that the founding fathers in the 1950s based the political ambition of being together and at peace – that is why they have just received a Nobel Prize, in a sense posthumously – on an economic project, an interest, a need to come together through the economy. Thus the European Coal and Steel Community, the Common Market, and then the common policies and the single market were born.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are not only the inheritors of this, but also the players in it, particularly over the last 20 years since the single market was agreed in 1992.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You were quite right in saying, Ms Bastos, that because of the crisis and because of the suffering and the anger felt by many citizens, right now this anniversary should not be a time for smugness, still less sadness or nostalgia. This anniversary is a time for us to be proactive and dynamic, for us to look at what has not worked, put it right and move on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I firmly believe – and I know that many of you share this view – that the battle for growth and competitiveness does not boil down to the single market, but that the single market is an essential condition for meeting the challenge of sustainable growth and competitiveness. The market has to be coherent. It has to be as solid as the ground under our feet, so that everything we build on it, the private initiatives of businesses large and small, the initiatives of Member States and local communities in the EU, is as effective as possible. The challenge for us today is to look together at how we can make this ground, the basis of Europe’s economy, more solid and coherent for our citizens, consumers and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why today’s debate is important: because it is both about citizens keeping an eye on that top 20 and about our undertaking, which is the Single Market Act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the issue of the top 20, my sincere thanks go to Ms Bastos for her constant watch and for having identified these 20 main concerns. The idea originally came from the report by Louis Grech two years ago, and also from our discussions at the Single Market Forum in Kraków.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree with the main points of this report and I think that any tools that can bring the internal market closer to citizens – which we are working on together in Strasbourg and Brussels – are very important. SOLVIT, which is now starting to work well and has solved a lot of problems through mediation, is now up and running. The Your Europe website, with its rising hit rate (I am told that it has 14 000 visitors a day, thanks particularly to the launch of its mobile app), is a good source of reference in the social media.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are the kinds of tool that citizens, firstly consumers, small businesses and savers, need.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think we will need to make more of them because citizens are expecting more, in practical terms, as you so rightly said, Ms Bastos, and that is what the consultation we did on the websites also told us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second prong of our action, of this proactive, dynamic approach, is to remove the obstacles that are obstructing the coherence of this large market. This is what we wanted to do in the wake of the Grech and Monti reports, through a series of operational measures, measures to help the drivers of the economy, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That was the Single Market Act. I monitor its implementation very carefully and very frequently, especially as regards the first phase, Single Market Act I. I was pleased that on 14 June you approved a resolution calling for the rapid adoption of the main measures in Single Market Act I. Mr Van Rompuy, on behalf of the European Council, also wrote to the Heads of State or Government to highlight the urgency of this. As far as possible we should try to produce good texts for the first reading, which meet people’s expectations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have a few short messages to broadcast on key issues for growth and competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The unitary patent: the Cypriot Presidency is currently dealing with this, and I am grateful for that. All the Member States should be making a final effort to reach a position where they can support the proposed compromises on the last point still under discussion. I would like to thank the chair, Mr Lehne, as well as Mr Rapkay and Mr Baldassarre, for their efforts towards achieving this compromise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Investors are awaiting texts on venture capital and social enterprise. We have one last point to deal with. I am going to suggest that the Council Presidency, the Cypriot Presidency, and the rapporteur arrange a meeting to find a solution to the legitimate question of tax havens, and we will thus have two new tools to encourage venture capital funding throughout the European Union and support businesses in the social economy, the ‘solidarity economy’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards public procurement, for which Mr Tarabella is rapporteur – and I would like to thank him and the shadow rapporteurs – we are close to an agreement aimed at simplifying access to public procurement contracts, and qualifying public money and putting it to better use with an excellent method for public procurement and concessions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is the issue of professional qualifications. The European Council is working on this too, and so are the rapporteurs, Ms Vergnaud and the shadow rapporteurs. I think we will be able to reach agreement on this item, at the latest by the start of 2013, particularly on the excellent idea, which you support, of the mobility of professional cards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Because there is no time to lose, because there are so many other problems as you said, Ms Bastos, the Commission – 10 or so of my colleagues, that is, not just me – has just proposed the Single Market Act II containing further priorities, further areas in which we need to make the single market work better. These are the transport and energy networks, which are the arteries of the single market, as well as mobility, businesses, and the digital economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is one last thing that for me is one of the conditions of sustainable growth, social cohesion and consumer confidence. In a few weeks’ time I will be presenting a proposal on a basic bank account and the transparency of bank account fees, as you unanimously asked me to do.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So we are working together and we are taking this proactive and dynamic approach. We still need the things we have already done to be implemented, as the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, whom I thank, and the chair, Mr Harbour, so often say. For us it is a question of credibility. I therefore share the concern of guaranteeing the good governance of the single market. Mr Schwab is going to make some proposals about this, on which my work will based, and also the Commission’s agenda, which I have described as ‘zero tolerance’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Every year, at the same time as the European Semester, we will be publishing indicators for the implementation of all the directives and regulations related to the internal market, particularly the Services Directive, which is a very important one and which has not been correctly applied. The idea of this is to see how far each country has got with transposition and implementation. I am determined that the texts you adopt will be applied. That is the job you should be asking the Commission to do; I can assure you that that is what I will be doing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I said at the start that the single market was the first and most important part of the political project of Europe. We are accountable for the smooth running of the single market. It is my firm belief that, to win the battle for growth and competitiveness, every citizen is necessary, and so is every business, and every country and region too. It is for these citizens, businesses and regions, from which new growth will come, that we are collectively responsible for ensuring the success of this new phase, over the next 20 years of the European single market.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, I congratulate Ms Bastos on her report, which is excellent. The objective of the single market 20 years ago was to create an open area without borders, where persons, goods, services and capital could move freely. Today this market comprises more than 500 million EU consumers. Regrettably, experience has highlighted differences between what was expected and what has actually happened. Urgent action is required at both national and EU level to remove the obstacles standing in the way of investments in energy infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The next multiannual financial framework must provide sufficient resources to finance energy efficiency measures and projects. I believe we need a legal framework that both acts as an incentive and integrates energy suppliers into the implementation of measures promoting energy efficiency. It is vital for Europe to start growing again, to improve its employment levels and regain the confidence of consumers in order to stimulate and raise the efficiency of its single market, which generates economic activities worth almost EUR 11 billion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank Ms Bastos for her excellent report. In my capacity as deputy for Mr Busuttil, I would like to set out the position of the Committee on Petitions. Petitions to the European Parliament are a barometer for the practical functioning of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, 2013 may be the year when the rights of citizens are significantly strengthened in this respect. There are problems with the lack of recognition of professional qualifications, a lack of clarity on consumer rights, the transfer of social insurance claims and the like.</p>
      <p sl="de">A further measure to combat what, in my opinion, amounts to a critical paucity of information to the general public would be the merger of the European Union’s various information services.</p>
      <p sl="de">I congratulate us all on the 20th anniversary of the single market and hope to see the strong development of this mechanism, which will play a significant part in the future of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, fundamentally, the single market is a wonderful project for employees and workers. Since the establishment of the single market in 1993, in the first 15 years alone – i.e. before the crisis – 2.77 million jobs were created, amounting to a 1.8 % increase in the overall employment rate. When we look closer, there are, of course, many negative aspects – but fundamentally it is a success. The single market has an impact on people’s normal, everyday lives: it is a massively positive, powerful instrument.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, where there is light there is also shadow. Jacques Delors built the single market on principles not only of competition but also of solidarity and cooperation. In recent years, much of the solidarity and cooperation has been lost. Therefore, I would like to remind us again of how important it is that social rights and the social model are placed on an equal footing with economic freedoms and I ask you to take this into consideration in all your efforts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question . – Mr President, I would like to ask Ms Regner: in your view, what could trade unions do to combat youth unemployment, for example in Spain and Portugal? Demonstrations will not be enough. What active policy could the single market implement in this respect?</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer . – Mr President, it is very hard for me to tell you what trade unions can do as far as creating jobs is concerned. Two things they certainly can do, however, are to cooperate actively in developing models – such as the dual system in Austria of employment allied to vocational training – and to contribute constructive ideas on how training should be developed. They are, in fact, doing this. Of course, they should also be doing this in Spain.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I think that the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the single market on 15 October were a real success, since they united very diverse stakeholders, as we call them in EU-speak, and solicited support for this project, which has now been in existence for 20 years. I would also like to congratulate expressly the Council and the Cyprus Presidency, which played an active role and is taking part in this discussion here today in the plenary session. This was a novel intervention for which we are exceedingly grateful.</p>
      <p sl="de">These celebrations have also shown that we must use the Single Market Acts I and II to advance the single market, which, although already in place, is not functioning properly in all areas. The Commission has also done its work in this area, which is why I would like to emphasise again what Ms Bastos said. Much has been said about the single market, but at some point we are going to be asked why it is still not fully functional. There is one simple answer to that question: more political will is required at the highest level of the Council, President-in-Office, and at the highest level of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has long been the case in Europe that we have formally adopted European directives in single market affairs. At Member State level, some of them are implemented correctly, some incorrectly and some inadequately. Hence I am pleased to see Commissioner Barnier declaring once again his zero-tolerance policy for incorrect implementation and failure to implement the single market acquis, since this will have a decisive effect.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need to talk about the single market in a different way. Nevertheless, I think it is very positive that Ms Regner has pointed out that the Single Market has done a lot for workers. It also brings cultural diversity in Europe right into people’s homes. It offers citizens the opportunity to experience Europe at home. We should be communicating the cultural dimension more, since economic data alone are not enough for citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Monti report’s observation in 2010 was that the rules of the single market were focused primarily on competitiveness and trade in goods, and took no notice of citizens. To put this right, the Commission has presented 50 proposals to relaunch the single market, 12 of them legislative priorities that are currently being examined and are about to be approved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the 20th anniversary of the single market, which we celebrate this month, the Commission is announcing a new set of proposals for the single market, entitled Act II. These include measures that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been asking for for a long time, and we are delighted to see them become a reality at last. I refer in particular to the section on social entrepreneurship, cohesion and consumer confidence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am delighted at the forthcoming improvement of rules on product safety, which is of prime importance for consumers, and at universal access to bank accounts, and the transparency needed on bank account fees. This legislation can demonstrate that Europe protects its citizens, is useful and is not just about austerity policies. The EU has not given up on its social model. We have a duty to maintain this courageous ambition, despite the handicaps.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, when it comes to Europe being protective and instilling confidence in its citizens, I am slightly more dubious about the proposals on transport and energy networks. I fear that the Commission is still stuck with its ideology of liberalising sectors of the network when we are still a long way from demonstrating the benefits for users, whether in terms of price or quality of services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It seems to me a more pressing issue to respond to the concrete expectations of citizens and consumers with legislation on collective redress, and framework legislation on public services, which we have been asking for for too long. Mr Barroso’s poor communication on public services was clearly not up to the challenge because these services also have a role in the revival of growth in a new industrial strategy. Similarly the Commission is congratulating itself on the potential for mobility that the single market offers citizens. This is to state the obvious, but it would be even better if there were a guarantee that social rights and pension rights would be recognised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue of mobility lies at the very heart of the legislation on recognising professional qualifications, on which I am rapporteur. The directive has to and will show that Europe can give real added value to growth, to employment and to its citizens, thanks to smart cooperation between all the institutions and in all the Member States. I am thinking particularly of the major innovation of a European Professional Card.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank my colleagues for the interest they have shown. We received more than 650 amendments. I know that we will reach some worthwhile compromises, including on sensitive issues like notaries and nurses. All that will remain is for us to persuade the Council to overcome the hesitancy of some Member States, because this is the message we need to give. Yes, the EU can and must be a source of progress and shared wealth to achieve positive, active solidarity between all of its Member States, driven by the same spirit of success from their shared destiny.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European single market, Europe’s greatest achievement, is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Border-free travel, work and study, a huge market for businesses and consumers: the single market gives us more freedoms and is a driver of trade and productivity.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the benefit that the European Union derives from the single market could be doubled if further barriers to trade – especially in the service sector – were to be removed by promoting the digital single market and integrating infrastructure. If we examine infrastructure in the single market, two things become clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, it is fragmented: few countries place a priority on cross-border links. Let us take the example of rail traffic: a goods train travelling from Italy to Sweden has to change its locomotive and crew up to four times. Secondly, the integration of national systems is extremely costly. Physical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s proposals currently being discussed for trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks address these and other problems. However, these ambitious aims can only be achieved if enough money is made available. Investments in infrastructure are the best use of EU funds, because they encourage sustainable growth, employment and European competitiveness. This is why it is so important that the Member States, as part of the ongoing negotiations over the multiannual financial framework, do not make any cuts in the Connecting Europe Facility.</p>
      <p sl="de">SMEs must also benefit more from the European single market. Ninety-nine per cent of European enterprises are SMEs, but only 25 % export within the single market. The further completion of the single market holds no dangers for Member States. On the contrary, it is an opportunity for more growth, more jobs and thereby more prosperity for people in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is without doubt one of the most important and successful European projects. However, this project – as Professor Monti’s report has shown – must be communicated to European citizens time and again. We must make it clear that the single market benefits not only the economy but, above all, citizens. We must address their concerns, as does Ms Bastos’s report.</p>
      <p sl="de">In times of deep economic crisis, high unemployment and growing poverty in many Member States, a balanced economic structure that maintains a balance between free markets and public goods is essential. It must always be emphasised that these public goods inevitably contribute to the functioning of these markets. Governance in the single market and better legislation also require us to examine whether European guidelines and regulations maintain or jeopardise this balance between the free market and public goods and whether they strengthen or undermine democratic structures including local and regional government.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this respect, I must also make the urgent point that I consider it a problem if the troika makes a recommendation, for example for Portugal and Greece, that water should be privatised, without the proper inclusion of the citizens of those countries. We must take care that we strike a balance that protects vitally needed public goods while also strengthening the free markets.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I particularly want to welcome this opportunity to debate not just the 20th anniversary of the 1992 programme but also Ms Bastos’ important report. There are strong links between those two because historically this Parliament has had a deep engagement with the whole of the single market programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Single European Act of 1988 brought Parliament into co-decision, but we have also consistently supported citizens and consumers in their engagement with the Single Market and in dealing with their frustrations. Indeed, the report that Ms Bastos has prepared comments on a list of such frustrations, which we asked to be prepared – and that is entirely consistent with our role in encouraging action on issues like mobile phone roaming, car insurance, and other areas. These are matters about which citizens were frustrated and on which we have been to the Commission and demanded action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second linkage I want to make between the 1992 programme and where we are today is about the fundamental importance, as the Commissioner said, of a clearly-defined set of actions to continue driving the single market forward: having those actions documented, having timescales for them and having deadlines in place. The Single European Act, which led to the 1992 programme, put nearly 300 specifications on the table. That was the scale of the task, in those days, in order to move forward with a single market. We now have the first Single Market Act, and the second. In those acts we have a lot of actions, neatly packaged together, and they constitute clear demands to Member States to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need this sort of continuing programme, ladies and gentlemen, and my nomination for the next set of actions is to get cracking with the digital single market. We know that is going to create jobs. It is not, in my view, being given enough priority, and that I think must be the next programme. I am already thinking ahead with my colleagues to 2014. This is an opportunity not to look back historically but to look ahead at what we need to do together.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I wish to thank Ms Bastos for the excellent cooperation that has made it possible for me also to be able to vote for her report.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I believe that it is appropriate that we should celebrate 20 years of the internal market, because it has led to more jobs and to more economic growth. But there are also what I would call a number of fringe issues about which I have some questions particularly for Commissioner Barnier.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, the increase in scale that is the automatic result of the internal market. Sometimes that is a good thing and it works efficiently but it also has cultural effects. In the past if you went to another town you would see different shops with products with which you were not yet familiar. Nowadays everywhere is beginning to look the same. Many people complain about that as well. They want fewer European chain stores and more small, independent businesses that make and sell handicrafts or other products that you do not see everywhere else.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Does the Commission agree with me that we must support SMEs, irrespective of whether companies have plans to expand their business to other Member States? Is there not in fact a need to support small, independent businesses and companies that wish to retain their own character and to remain small? Is it not discrimination if EU funds are available only to companies that wish to expand abroad?</p>
      <p sl="nl">A second problem concerns social entitlements. Professor Monti has already alluded to this: capital moves more quickly than work and, if we do nothing, competition will soon prevail over conditions of employment. That is precisely what we are now seeing. Is the Commission going to take initiatives against social dumping? Is the Commission going to study the possibilities of a European minimum wage, linked to national purchasing power?</p>
      <p sl="nl">A third area of tension concerns public services. We have had many bad experiences with the privatisation of what was previously the public sector. Can the Commission confirm that Greece and Portugal will be forced to privatise the water sector? And if that is the case, does this then mean the beginning of compulsory privatisation via the internal market? Many people are concerned about this and have started a public campaign for the right to water. How is the Commission going to deal with this issue?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 20 years of the internal market have undoubtedly had various positive effects, but also other less positive ones. There are still very many important issues that remain unresolved but that we can agree on in part. For example, the ability of EU citizens to open bank accounts in other Member States, the portability of pensions, and the problems concerning small and medium-sized enterprises. Obviously we agree on all these things, but there is one aspect that I want to emphasise, about which perhaps too little is said.</p>
      <p sl="it">Sometimes rules are decided in Brussels that may be good for many countries but that cannot always be applied everywhere in the same way. For example, Italian bathing establishments are something typical only of Italy. If the Services Directive is applied too rigidly, they are in danger of ending up in the hands of some new multinational bathing establishment company, sweeping away at a stroke thousands of family-run micro-enterprises. Harmonisation is okay but standardisation is not, the principle of subsidiarity should always be followed fully, and there should therefore be greater involvement of national, regional and local authorities in the decisions made.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, doubtless the single market has created some substantial advantages in citizens’ daily lives, from a larger choice of products to the possibility of working or practising a profession in other Member States. However, 62 % of EU citizens believe that the single market only provides advantages for large companies and 52 % believe that the single market is making working conditions worse.</p>
      <p sl="de">Citizens are not sceptical without reason: many efforts to extend the single market, including those made in the area of public procurement, are misguided. There is a real danger that companies from other Member States will not abide by the tariff agreements. In addition, many harmonisations ultimately benefit only large industry and not consumers. I need only mention the infamous incandescent light bulb ban.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the Commission wants its Single Market Act II to improve labour and corporate mobility, we must get to grips with the abuse of freedom of movement, e.g. the bogus ‘self-employed’ people from the east working in the construction industry who, in Austria and Germany, are virtually wage-slaves. Great caution is required, owing to the opening of the labour market for Bulgaria and Romania. By dint of a somewhat unconventional citizenship policy, hundreds of thousands of Moldovans, Ukrainians and Russians with Romanian passports are entering Europe. This is good news for large companies but bad news for the local workforce. The single market can certainly do a lot, but it cannot be the ultimate solution to the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I have had occasion to hear during Single Market Week, people are not aware of the benefits the market brings them. This year’s anniversary is an excellent opportunity to reflect on how the public might be better informed of these benefits, and what else we have to do to free up the full potential of the market, particularly in support of economic growth and the creation of new jobs. Certainly one important step we have to take is to define the problems that citizens and SMEs encounter in the single market. We already have a number of proposals and actions which constitute responses to these problems, but it is important that they be adopted quickly and introduced effectively in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For both the market and the public, the Services Directive, implementation of which is now of fundamental significance, is playing a very important role. There is a need to create a coherent law which will guarantee dynamic development of the single market, because doing away with administrative barriers in one area and leaving them standing in another will block development of the market. For example: one of the objectives of public procurement reform is to make it easier for SMEs to gain access to public contracts, but implementation of this objective will only matter if at the same time we help SMEs to put a contract thus gained into effect, by introducing proportionate rules on employee delegation. Employee delegation is in turn closely linked to the provision of services in the EU and the effective application of the Services Directive.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, in a seminar organised in honour of the single market we engaged in a lively discussion on which factors had caused the greatest change in the lives of citizens over the last 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The media coverage often stresses the importance of the freedom of choice provided by a common market. The majority of seminar participants were, however, of the opinion that, besides the mobility of goods and services, the most significant benefit had been the fact that the opportunities to move around in a borderless Europe had increased. Indeed, we must make sure that workers, students and travellers can trust that their rights will be respected when they move about in the single market.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I hope that we do not give free rein to the nationalist and protectionist views that have been brought to the surface by the financial crisis, but rather strive by all possible means to support the common single market. Not merely in the economic sense, but because it also integrates Europe at the cultural and intellectual level. It is important that we continually strive to promote the mobility of all citizens, particularly those who are disadvantaged.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner but also with the rapporteur that the internal market has been a tremendous success. However, I am continuing to hear many complaints about the incorporation of directives into national law, particularly from SMEs, and I would ask you again to focus more on regulations so that the legislation is the same for the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I agree with my fellow Members, including Mr Schwab, that the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of the internal market were very successful, but in my view they were too inward looking and the citizens of Europe still know too little about the success of this internal market. At the moment Europe is less popular than it was 20 years ago. Communication – let us call it marketing – is our greatest problem. A customer – as an SME would say – has to know that a product is very good before he or she buys it and that applies to Europe as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The internal market must create the conditions for people to get the best out of themselves, but they must be well informed. Therefore, Commissioner, I would ask you before 2017 to organise a major marketing programme so that all European citizens are aware of the advantages.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is proposing that we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market and forge further ahead with its completion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the field of transport, two areas are identified in Single Market Act II: rail and maritime transport. I am surprised not to see cabotage services provided by road, scheduled for 2013, mentioned here. This will have a massive impact on the environment and lead to more social dumping than is the case at present. I would like to think this was an oversight, though one might consider it a deliberate error.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you can be very pleased with the achievements of the last 20 years, but you cannot hide the reality of the social landscape or the crisis affecting Europe on the job front. As far as the forthcoming reforms in both the maritime and the rail sectors are concerned, these are based on a one-size-fits-all approach, that of liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, this headlong rush has to stop. The single market is not dogma. It is a tool that should serve economic development, environmental transition and the social wellbeing of our fellow citizens. We cannot reasonably take any more without introducing social and fiscal harmonisation measures that are effective with any future directive. There has to be a level playing field for everyone. My group will, in particular, be making sure that we avoid the abuses of the past and, for every area where the market is being liberalised, will demand that a social and environmental package be introduced so that competition is fair and brings development and prosperity for our continent.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the ECR shadow on the Bastos report, I was keen to stress the need for concrete action to solve citizens’ problems, which include the recognition of professional qualifications, obtaining health care abroad, opening a bank account in another Member State and enhanced comparability of financial services on offer to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Citizens need to see tangible benefits from the single market. The amendments I tabled on this report covered the promotion of the Internal Market Information (IMI) system in the recognition of professional qualifications, enhancing the employability of young people and the need to prevent over-regulation. I was particularly happy that my amendments calling for the SME test to be applied consistently across all policy areas, and for a review of all regulations which negatively impact on SMEs, were adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard I look forward to the report we have requested from the Commission, with recommendations, on legislation which hampers SMEs, and that is due by June 2013. As we debate the Single Market Act, having just celebrated Single Market Week, I want to mention a significant figure I came across this week: between 2002 and 2011, 13 million jobs were created by the EU’s 21 million SMEs. They are our drivers for growth, and that statistic demonstrates yet again why we must avoid placing burdens on SMEs at a time when we need job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a responsibility to address the 20 main concerns in relation to the single market, and this is a good start. But we must be mindful, during these difficult times, that the European Union was created for free trade, and we must keep this spirit of free trade and not succumb to protectionism. A properly-functioning barrier-free single market is what we need and what we must deliver.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in an ever more globalised world it is vital the UK does not put all its eggs into one basket. We are disproportionately affected by the eurozone crisis because we are too tightly bound to Europe, with whom we trade at a deficit. The Commonwealth represents a far broader international and diverse market place with similar systems of governance and a common language and includes some of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commonwealth markets have grown by 7.3 % over recent years, while the EU markets look set to contract. Yet we are limited as to how far we can exploit our ties with the Commonwealth due to EU membership. Domestic bilateral trade and investment treaties become subsumed under the new EU trade negotiations, disabling the UK from forging independent and prosperous import and export contracts with the wider world. The EU model is cumbersome and outdated. The UK must embrace globalisation as a dynamic nation with full sovereignty over policy. Isolating ourselves from the rest of the world by shackling ourselves to a failing EU project is dangerous.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard so many celebratory contributions that it might be wise to introduce some modesty and be a little self-critical amidst all this celebration. In view of the various Member States’ unemployment rates – in some cases an average of over 20 %, or more than one in five people, is unemployed, and over half of young people – we should in a sense show a little self-criticism and humility.</p>
      <p sl="de">In developing the single market, we should stop predicating everything on the philosophy of liberalisation. At the moment, some countries really need their young academics and workforce not to leave the country. In this case, liberalisation is the wrong message to send. I would also call on us to consider whether it is really wise to further liberalise the financial services sector, which has already gone completely off the rails. We must consider whether the entire finance industry should, in a manner of speaking, be placed under new control, which in the past ensured that whole countries could not be ransacked, as is the case now.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the introduction of the single market was a massive step forward for European citizens. I am convinced that legislators followed a guiding principle in 1986 when they created the legislative package. The first was the smooth access to capital, goods and services, and the free movement of people. However, we should not forget that there are still 80 million EU citizens who remain isolated from these, either partially or completely. Making the single market accessible to people living with disabilities is extremely important with a view to ensuring all-round access. Regardless of the kind of disability people live with, they are immediately faced with barriers in the light of their condition. These barriers have to be dismantled as soon as possible, since they are created by society, not by our own disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ms Bastos highlighted and made recommendations for furthering increased accessibility. I would like to thank her for this. I will take this opportunity to draw attention once more to the need, especially in the current economic crisis, for a European package of legislative proposals on accessibility, because people with disabilities are important.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is one of the pillars that supports the edifice of Europe, and as you said, Commissioner, we are accountable for how it works.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Single Market Act is an excellent initiative in this regard and we should all welcome it. We should indeed be working together to boost the single market and improve the way it operates. Commissioner, you have drafted an excellent proposal for a directive on the modernisation of public procurement and, as you have said, we in Parliament are trying to improve it. We are indeed moving forward in a constructive manner towards greater efficiency in public spending which, as you have often said, accounts for 19 % of the EU’s gross domestic product.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are trying to achieve greater efficiency in terms of sustainable development, jobs, innovation, social inclusion and compliance with the rules, but also environmental protection. This is fundamentally important because it is the single market and some of the abuses that have happened – perhaps because we have overlooked social harmonisation too much – have caused our citizens to experience frustration and doubt owing to the competition between Member States, the pitting of citizens and especially workers against one another instead of being united in a Europe that is more prosperous for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I just want to mention two examples that concern us in the directive. One is stopping uncontrolled subcontracting, where public money is lost at every step along the chain, in long chains of subcontractors. We simply want to regulate it, make it more transparent. Subcontracting is a good thing because it obviously helps SMEs to participate more in public procurement contracts, which is something we all want and something there is probably too little of at the moment. What concerns us is compliance with the rules. It is not easy to achieve compliance with the International Labour Organisation Convention of 1994 because only 10 Member States have ratified it. Compliance with existing national rules is equally important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, would you join with me, Commissioner, in fighting for greater compliance with the rules, which will improve the single market and make it more harmonious, to the benefit of all European citizens?</p>

      <p sl="sl">Thanks go to the rapporteur, who based her findings on real life. When barriers fall, the dividing walls are lower as well. Companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, will have more opportunities to connect. Connected through innovative ideas and products, they will be more competitive globally, in a world where many people just want the same standard of living and environment as we have in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">That is why I think we need to spend some time on issues concerning the social nature of the measures that form the single market: we should not see people merely as consumers; they are also citizens and they are also producers. We talk about people’s rights and about how all these separate areas where people should be respected and recognised are linked. Well, that is where we should be coming up with solutions to make the single market more of a reality.

That is a credit to you, Commissioner, and thank you for your considerable commitment.</p>

It has given us greater freedom of choice, lower prices and a better standard of living.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, Ms Bastos, congratulations on your very successful work. The Union’s single market was set up in 1992, when Jacques Delors was President of the European Commission. At the time, Mr Delors summed up the three basic principles of the single market: competition that stimulates, cooperation that strengthens, and solidarity that unites. Twenty years on, the economic and financial crisis has rekindled the threat of national protectionism and it is clear that the internal market is not a fait accompli . In celebrating these 20 years we must take the opportunity to relaunch the single market with a view to placing the market at the service of citizens and not citizens at the service of the market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, priorities must be set and I should like to mention one in particular. We need a common policy for the production and distribution of high-efficiency energy at prices accessible to the consumer via the European energy market, served by cross-border infrastructures with the possibility of leveraging EU investment, representing European added value. Madam President, the common market also has a role to play in the field of energy.</p>

This anniversary is a great opportunity to think collectively, and overcome the factors and barriers which prevent us from utilising the full potential of the single market. However, whilst celebrating we should not lose sight of the fact that the main beneficiaries of the single market are the citizens and enterprises. It is our task, as legislators, to make this happen on their behalf. This means our duties do not end when efficient legislation is adopted; we are also responsible for its appropriate implementation, and for creating cross-border synergies between the various national public administration systems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to emphasise that the single market is the best tool available to stimulate economic growth, and therefore it is extremely important that we treat each and every issue associated with the single market as a priority. I congratulate the rapporteur, who put in some sterling work, and I also welcome the efforts of the European Commission in this area to date. However, I believe the process must be continued. We need even greater commitment to implementation. We have deployed significant resources to creating fast and effective information portals, but overlaps have also emerged that impede the very same work. It is crucial that we define goals moving forward that focus on a consumer-based approach. In future I would like to see nothing impeding Member States from treating this issue as a priority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market has become a matter of course for our citizens. Who can fail to remember with amusement the judgment of 1979 on Cassis de Dijon or the banana war with the United States? As we look at global trade wars or disputes, the European single market appears as a mainstay of the European philosophy: no barriers, no discrimination, legal certainty and fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, in the interplay between the global economic powers we, the European Union, must continue to safeguard the rights of consumers and SMEs and protect consumers against new dangers, for example, chemical substances or new, creative tricks by vendors, such as exist in the financial market. We social democrats support the Commission in its measures against dominant practices and unfair competition, regardless of who is involved, even when this applies to Microsoft or Google, to German energy companies or Gazprom.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must also observe Jacques Delors’s third point more closely: the single market also means solidarity, which unites.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is fantastic that we are celebrating 20 years of the single market this year and 20 years of European citizenship next year. The single market and our citizens belong together. It is also good that we changed the name of the committee from ‘Internal Market and Legal Affairs’ to ‘Internal Market and Consumer Protection’. The single market can only function if we can really freely experience the four freedoms of movement – people, goods, services and capital – in the single market and if we have regulated and controlled them at the European level. There can be no successful single market without internationally active, competitive SMEs. They are the heartbeat of the single market and the driver of employment in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every day we are confronted with two problem areas: some people are complaining that barriers still exist, while others are complaining about the demonstrably inconsistent – or non-existent – application of EU law in many countries. We need to work on both areas. In the financial services and transport sectors, the single market has not yet been fully realised. It is important that we forge ahead in the sectors of transport, professional qualifications, the digital single market, public procurement, banking services and the internationalisation of SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me start by saying how good it was last week to celebrate together the great achievements of the integrated market, and I would like to congratulate Commissioner Barnier on all the initiatives of the Commission. You managed, Commissioner, to help us show that it is a win-win situation for all, for business and consumers; you gave a face to the single market. I welcome the single market mainly because of the commitment to moving forward in really finalising what is already in the pipeline, and I count on your support with the Member States also to move forward. It is a commitment to a united Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moving forward in the single market now is a way to keep together non-euro Member States and euro Member States. This is what this Parliament wants. Help us to move it forward with the Member States, too. Let us start with the digital single market. I very much appreciate your zero tolerance policy for the implementation of the Services Directive. Let us move forward on the previous issues that are missing, such as access to credit for companies, the Professional Qualifications Directive and dispute resolution online – this is the highway to jobs in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the twentieth anniversary of the creation of the Single Market is a great achievement: one set of rules rather than 27 sets of rules, access for Scottish businesses to a market of over 500 million people and a social model to underpin this freedom. Europe is more than a free market. I am pleased that the Commissioner this morning mentioned the importance of social cohesion. I also welcome your statement on basic bank accounts, Commissioner, and I hope that credit unions and their important role are included in your discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speakers today are correct to point to weaknesses. Twenty years ago we did not use mobile phones in the way we do today; in fact, most people did not have a mobile phone. Now, the ability to access information and buy goods and services on the move is a driver for growth. I must emphasise the importance of the digital single market, which the chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has mentioned today. If I can give you an example, Commissioner, concerning e-books and libraries, certain publishers today are making decisions not to allow libraries to access books in a digital format. You, Commissioner, have an opportunity to prevent this ‘book apartheid’ from happening and to find a solution to the urgent challenges. We cannot allow books to go the way of digital music, where one company appears to determine the price of a download.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his strong commitment to deepening the single market, which is evident in the Single Market Act.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the benefits the single market has brought to citizens and businesses, and to our economy overall, I think we should be critical in identifying the areas where we can do better, and take the necessary measures. This process was started with the first Single Market Act, which is under implementation, and it is now being completed with the Single Market Act II. I believe the approach taken by the Commission and the priorities identified are correct. Nevertheless I would like to stress that these measures must be accompanied by better governance of the single market and a strong commitment from Member States to transpose the legislation correctly and in a timely and more transparent way, making maximum use of correlation tables. Enforcement is a key priority if we want the single market to deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, it is essential to communicate more with businesses and citizens and to associate them as closely as we can with the deepening of the single market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the single market is frequently used as a tool as regards its alleged contribution to employment, growth and, astonishingly, economic and social cohesion. Except that reality, stubborn as it is, constantly contradicts this wonderful vision. The truth is that the single market has gone hand in hand with the weakening of the more economically vulnerable countries, the destruction of productive capacity, and an increase in external dependency. These 20 years have meant commerce prevailing over the public interest. The market has encroached upon almost every sphere of economic and social life, upon public services, with liberalisations and privatisations, producing inequality, poverty and exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The single market has been opening the way to monopolistic concentration in various sectors of activity. To take the case of transport – as regards the so-called freedom of movement of persons within this single market, it is clear today that it serves not harmonisation in progress, but on the contrary, the levelling down of living and working conditions in Europe. That is the balance sheet of the past 20 years that reality places before us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let us remind ourselves of how different, cumbersome and even impossible European citizens and businesses would find many of the mundane tasks we take for granted were it not for the groundwork already done on the internal market over the past 20 years. Moreover, cross-border trade in the EU has been an invaluable source of prosperity, increased access and economies of scale for our businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, given the present design of our monetary union, trade has also been a source of imbalances between the centre and the periphery in the EU, forcing large numbers of our young unemployed people to seek jobs abroad. Our current work on the review of the Professional Qualifications Directive is acutely important, and we must make sure, when dealing with healthcare professionals, that we facilitate professional mobility without jeopardising key principles such as patient safety, and that we do not undermine training standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The internal market is not an end in itself but rather a means of achieving prosperity and increasing social cohesion. That must guide us in our work, so that we can arrest the race to the bottom which we have witnessed with blind liberalisation moves on many fronts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, communication is actually the basis for the creation of new jobs. The European Union, through the Roaming Regulation, has set standards, and not only in the single market, since it is also in the process of setting international standards, as communication also needs standards and technical legislation, and this was accordingly supported and achieved by the European Parliament. The Connecting Europe Facility is a further step towards entering the high-speed broadband field and making communication affordable. Affordable communication is also the basis for a successful strategy for the single market. For that reason, the frequency regulations and the framework regulations for future auction and allocation of frequencies will need to play an appropriate role.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Commissioner, the 20th anniversary of the functioning of the internal market more or less forces us to take stock of the situation. We have already heard in the debate about all the successes, but there is still a long way to go before the internal market can become an area where all citizens of the European Union can lead contented and decent lives.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that a well-functioning European consumer policy, which places the citizen first, is an essential pillar. Consumers have already expressed some specific observations; it is now up to us to turn their expectations into understandable rules, and this includes awareness-raising and education of consumers. Neither should we forget that the rules will work only if they are enforceable and citizens are able to actually assert their rights. In this regard the Single Market Act II in my view still offers too little.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Finally, on reaching this anniversary, I would like to express a wish for the internal market to be fair to all its participants – consumers, employees and businesses, regardless of their size – and especially that people will place their trust in it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is without a doubt a great achievement, where and when it functions. What has been put before us as the second single market package also contains many positive proposals. However, I would like to put forward a few additions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first concerns transport. In the European Union we are currently creating the trans-European networks in order to build railway corridors. However, what is lacking is harmonisation of current voltages, gauges and safety devices; this is absolutely necessary if the opportunities presented by the single market for rail transport are actually to be taken up.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second concerns rail passengers: standardised electronic ticketing should be introduced – exactly as we are familiar with for air travel.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third concerns the sale of cars: if you buy a car and move to another country, you are faced with an expensive bureaucratic obstacle race. The same applies if you buy a used car. In this regard, I call upon the Commission to develop constructive proposals to make the single market fully operational.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the single market is one of the European Union’s greatest achievements and certainly represents one of the strongest pillars in the development of the Union, its Member States and its regions. However, in order for it to be efficient and fair, its policies must be based on the notion of equality of opportunities for citizens and for all regions, fostering the Union’s internal cohesion. Within this context, we need to acknowledge that we can only achieve greater development in our most remote regions, such as the outermost regions, through their greater integration into the single market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regions such as the Azores need to continue to increase their competitiveness, improving their conditions for competition, but we shall never be able to achieve that if we do not find better solutions to our accessibility issues in the field of transport. We could achieve that through specific instruments that provide a better response to the problems that arise because we are so far away. We therefore propose that the Commission should consider a specific programme, of the POSEI Transportes variety, as an essential instrument for the integration of such regions into the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, 500 million consumers, 21 million companies, a trade volume of EUR 2.8 billion within the EU and EUR 1.5 billion worldwide – 20 years of the single market. In my view, these figures really speak for themselves. Citizens gain many advantages through the single market. I will single out one point: they can work where they like. Mobility is one of the greatest achievements, but as yet it is little known. Our citizens must be better informed, since, as the economic crisis rages, openness to mobility and cross-border business connections and services in some States could alleviate the situation for some people, especially young people.</p>
      <p sl="de">In spite of everything, Member States’ national characteristics must be respected and right now we must do everything possible to promote growth, which will alleviate the economic crisis for EU citizens.</p>

There are a number of issues – and I would like to hear what you have to say on these – that lie at the heart of the economic and social crisis, as we call it: fiscal harmonisation, public welfare services, minimum wages in Europe, the establishment of job-rich closer cooperation, the promotion of cross-border cooperation, and the drafting of a fair trade policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, one concern that people have is that we react so slowly to the demands that people voice, and specifically to their concerns. This document we are currently discussing is in fact 20 main concerns. It was presented to the public a year ago during the Single Market Forum in Kraków. We must work together a little bit faster. I am definitely with those who are also calling for better information. I would like to remind you once more of the consultations that have been held. The Commission organises them in only a few languages. They must be easily accessible, there must be good information about them and they must take place in all the official languages of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have been listening attentively to the debates about this year’s Single Market Week, and it is true, as has been mentioned in today’s discussion, that the digital economy is at the centre of the debate on the single market, but the development of internet commerce is being held back by the fact that we do not have a single postal services market. We have had success with roaming, Commissioner, although I was hoping for a more ambitious proposal from the European Commission. In that case, let us take a look at the postal service, as disproportionately high payments for cross-border consignments, payments which have no good grounds, are dividing the European market and holding back the development of electronic commerce.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Commissioner, after twenty years spent building the Union’s single market, it is a good opportunity for us to take stock of what has been achieved from the original plans and what does not work as we might have wished. There is no doubt that large retail chains and multinational companies are already benefiting from this ambitious European project.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On the other hand, when it comes to freedom of movement of labour we are not succeeding in realistically creating conditions such that our citizens can have equal access to work anywhere in the Union. The European labour market is clearly failing to absorb large numbers of our citizens who are looking for work and who come from areas affected by the crisis. We must therefore continue, Commissioner, to improve the mechanisms that shape the conditions for the functioning of the single market and seek to improve the conditions for the mobility of workers, self-employed persons and small businesses.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, on the occasion of the anniversary, I would like to wish the single market chronia polla (‘many more years’), but I think this is not enough. I feel it would be more appropriate to say ‘many good years’, ‘many effective years’, ‘many years of rapid progress’. Technology is overtaking us. Until now, when talking about the single market, we have all been saying – as an example of its success – how cheaply we can talk on our mobile phones, and this is an achievement of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I have a negative example to give you: nearly all of us in this Chamber have our iPads; but if this iPad, this smart device you have bought, say, in Belgium, gives you problems when you go to the UK or some other Member State, you are told ‘go to the country where you bought it’.</p>
      <p sl="el">I say this to show that we need to act more quickly, because we need to do more than just talk and celebrate. We need action. We have been talking about 12 priority actions and 50 supplementary actions. Of these 12 priority actions, 11 are behind schedule, and this has been admitted by the Commission at an official function. All this gives me cause for concern, but I remain optimistic, because in a time of crisis the single market is more necessary than ever for the European citizen who really suffers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, yes, there are reasons to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the internal market. However, the internal market for goods, services and investments should be accompanied by a single labour market, removing obstacles to the mobility of workers. Without the single labour market there is not really an internal market. Secondly, the single market means free competition, but free competition presupposes a level playing field and not regulatory dumping, fiscal dumping or social dumping. Market integration should be accompanied by regulatory integration, fiscal integration and social integration.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in a period of economic crisis, we are particularly able to value the advantages of a single market. This very single market has become an engine for growth for the European economy. Embracing more than 500 million consumers and 23 million businesses, it is the largest economic area in the world, and the 27 EU Member States make up a larger internal market than the 50 states of the USA. We should slough off our complexes and place our trust in the potential inherent in the EU. Fully united, we are in a position to deal with competition not only from the United States, but also from the ‘emerging’ powers. Of course we must be aware of the restrictions that remain in place, including those linked to poor transport or power networks, problems with the free flow of services or the lack of a genuine digital market – this is something of which my colleagues have spoken. The Single Market Act II, however, provides proof that awareness of the unutilised potential is increasing, and that the European Union is attempting to take down the barriers that exist. I wish the Commissioner every success in strengthening the single market and overcoming these barriers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the single market saw a series of events taking place in Brussels, at the European Parliament and in all Member States which culminated in the ‘Single Market Week for New Growth’ from 15 to 20 October.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally had the honour to participate in the closing event in Nicosia on 20 October, at which Commissioner Barnier, the Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) – Malcolm Harbour – and IMCO Member Malgorzata Handzlik spoke about the past, present and future of the single market in front of numerous representatives of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Members have confirmed in their speeches, the establishment of the single market brought not only huge benefits for citizens by increasing the choice of products and services and lowering their prices but was also a driving force for businesses, fostering their competitiveness and innovation capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, despite impressive achievements the single market and its benefits are not yet fully visible to the citizens, for whom it was originally created. The single market still remains for many a very abstract and bureaucratic concept which is unfortunately too often reduced to top-down rule-making by Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, even after 20 years of its existence, there is still a considerable gap between expectations and reality regarding the single market, with European citizens and businesses still facing obstacles in exercising their rights – or to put it more bluntly – even after 20 years of success, there is absolutely no room for complacency. On the contrary, what we learned from the celebrations is that we have to step up our efforts in order to pursue the establishment of a seamless single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we need to better inform consumers and businesses on the existing tools, in order to create the kind of ownership which is absolutely necessary for stakeholders to move the single market forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need to pass on the message that despite the global financial crisis the single market did not fragment further – which is an encouraging sign of inherent strength, and hence the EU has to build on that. Moreover, completing the single market is not only about passing new laws, but increasingly a matter of implementing correctly and enforcing the already existing rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, as Europe and other parts of the world struggle to recover from the financial crisis, boosting growth and employment is the number one priority for leaders across the EU. Europe has enormous unrealised potential to restore growth and confidence by unleashing the power of such a single market. In this respect, the Presidency welcomes the launch earlier this month of the new Single Market Act II by Commissioner Barnier. The proposals concentrate, very rightly, on areas of the single market with the highest potential for growth, and should also work as a vector for social and territorial cohesion and for integrating Europe’s markets better by improving mobility for individuals and businesses, encouraging entrepreneurship and making finance more accessible across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to the above, the 12 key actions proposed concentrate on the network industries and the digital economy. Integration in these areas is essential to creating the conditions for more economic growth and new jobs. Notably, the creation of jobs is an absolute priority for the Presidency as the economic crisis has threatened social cohesion. Unemployment – especially among the young – is skyrocketing in some places. In this respect I would like to seize this opportunity to repeat our Presidency’s full commitment to finalising as many as possible pending dossiers on the Single Market Act I, in particular those covering alternative dispute resolution, on-line dispute resolution, venture capital, social investment funds and the accounting directives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Promising progress has been achieved on patents, as was mentioned by Commissioner Barnier, and I am grateful to him, as well as to the European Parliament for the understanding and positive cooperation on this very delicate issue. We are indeed now at a watershed and if we can overcome the persisting difficulties we will at last have the chance to put in place a genuinely European patent system.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council has set the goal of agreement on all these proposals by the end of 2012. In short, we will all be committed to intensifying the current pace of work. I trust there will be sufficient flexibility on the part of both legislators, enabling timely adoption.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by recapitulating the following imperatives: the single market is the biggest economic – but also political – asset of the European Union. Despite the recent economic downturn, the single market has continued to function and to deliver. However, in order to be able to reap all its benefits it is essential to breathe new life into that single market, with European citizens and consumers placed at its centre. I remain confident that together we will manage to successfully implement the envisaged measures in order to make the single market a vibrant and living reality for Europe’s citizens. Congratulations to Commissioner Barnier and the Commission, the European Parliament, and in particular to the Chair of the Internal Market Committee, Malcolm Harbour, to the rapporteur, Regina Bastos, and to all the other Members and other people who are working so hard to make a genuine single market part of our daily life in the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="4-072-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, my sincerest thanks to everyone for the high standard of this very dynamic debate and the fact that so many of you have taken part.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of you – Mr Scicluna at the start, Ms Werthmann, Mr Obermayr – have said that we needed the single market for growth. I would reiterate that it is not enough just for the single market to function well. There are plenty of initiatives – whether national, private, public or European – that should encourage growth, but the single market is a necessary condition for this. If it is working well, all the private and public initiatives that support the single market will work better and be more effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I cannot agree with Mr Zéribi, who was not here when I spoke and who has now left, but who criticised me several times for being smug. That was frankly not the tone of my comments. There is no place for smugness, nostalgia or sadness at the moment. None at all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to take stock of the progress we have made, and many of the political groups have emphasised the amount of progress in terms of jobs. Mr Ferreira has also left but he talked of a race to the bottom. That is not true. The 2 500 000 students who have taken part in Erasmus, the lowering of mobile phone tariffs by 70 %, the millions of citizens who now have access to cheaper airfares: that is not a race to the bottom. These are the advantages of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I think we should also be looking ahead. Mr Pargneaux was just talking about the new model. Indeed we should be and are working together on very practical initiatives as part of this new economic and social model. Mr Pargneaux was asking about closer cooperation initiatives. Take the example of patents: here is a practical initiative for closer cooperation that I presented a year and a half ago and you supported, which will clearly lead to many new jobs through the smart protection of inventions throughout the single market. And the basic bank account, which you called for unanimously. These initiatives are part of this model.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not smugness. We need to watch out, however, because, as Mr Repo and Mr Schmidt said – they used the word protectionism – the single market is currently in the paradoxical situation of being the first potential victim of the crisis if we let protectionism, national withdrawal and nationalism, which we sense is on the increase everywhere because of the crisis, run riot at the exact moment when the single market is our best chance, our leading asset for getting out of the crisis. We must ensure it is working well and is destined to become what both you and I believe in: a competitive social market economy. All four of these words are important; not just one or two of them as we have perhaps thought, even in Brussels, in the last 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Just briefly, many of you – Ms Vergnaud, Mr Zéribi, Mr Creutzmann and Mr Correia de Campos – spoke about networks. These are the arteries of the single market. That is why we made them a priority in the Single Market Act II. There is plenty to do in this field.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Creutzmann and Mr Pirker mentioned the issues concerning railways, which are dealt with by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and its chair, Mr Simpson. The procedures we have for certifying rail companies and approving rolling stock are much too lengthy, much too expensive. This is not liberalisation, this is encouraging harmonisation so that the free movement of people and goods can work. We have work to do on harmonisation including, Mr Correia de Campos, in the field of energy. The lack of a single market in energy, which Ms Vergnaud also mentioned, costs consumers EUR 13 billion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore need to harmonise the single energy market. I could give other examples in the maritime sector. Why is it – and this is just one example – that when it arrives in Naples, cargo that comes from Rotterdam has to undergo the same formalities as cargo from Shanghai? That is not a single market. We need to sort out these problems practically. That is the aim of all the measures we will be taking with Commissioner Kallas, in the Single Market Act II. I would reiterate to Mr Becker that we are working together, just as you are. I am not working alone but with 12 of my fellow Commissioners, which means that the Single Market Acts I and II implement the work of many of the European Parliament’s committees. This is particularly the case with Commissioner Kroes, my colleague who is responsible for the digital agenda. I was very interested in what the committee chair, Mr Harbour said, but also Mr Rübig, Ms Rapti, Mr Arias Echeverría, whom I thank very much, and Ms Jazłowiecka, Ms Stihler too, and Mr Creutzmann, on the digital single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The task we have taken on is a vast one, I believe, but it is not being executed quickly enough. Very soon we will need to be thinking about what the Single Market Act III could consist of, in 2014. Mr Harbour, we should probably focus on new measures to give the digital single market a boost. I am expecting to talk to Commissioner Kroes and my other colleagues about this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr de Jong and Mr Karas mentioned SMEs and product safety. I worry a great deal – and Commissioner Tajani does too – that the measures we are taking in the Single Market Act will be approved or rejected on the basis of whether they are advantageous or disadvantageous for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Trust me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I just want to ask you, as I am asking the Council, Mr Mavroyiannis, whom I thank for being here, to speed up the adoption of certain texts, on public procurement, Mr Tarabella, accounting standards, and capital requirements IV, for which we have issued some proposals on transparency as the rapporteur Mr Karas knows, which should encourage the financing of SMEs by the banking sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are some very concrete texts. If you look at each one of them in detail, you will find they contain measures that are more favourable to or less restrictive for SMEs. To Mr Kósa, who raised the issue of daily living for disabled people – for which I thank him – I want to say that as far as product safety is concerned, we will be very mindful of this, along with Commissioner Reding, when special measures are proposed in 2013 on the access of disabled people to a larger number of products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many of you mentioned the social dimension – the competitive social market economy – and I thank you for that, particularly Ms Regner, Ms Rühle, Mr de Jong and Mr Rübig. Once we know something has to be done and we need to introduce reforms, one of the keys to this is social dialogue, which is something some countries do better than others. For example, I could compare the high standard of social dialogue that takes place in Germany with a frequent absence of social dialogue in my own country. We cannot reform, we cannot win the competitiveness and sustainable growth battle without social cohesion, without social dialogue, and without respect for the social partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want my agreement with this to be noted, and I also want to say to anyone who is worried about privatisation, Ms Rühle and Ms Regner, that the treaty clearly and, I believe, definitively stipulates that each country is free to choose how it organises its public services. I would be the first person, wherever I am, to protect this freedom of choice when it comes to the standard of public services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should just say, however, that within the framework of this freedom, if one or two countries decide to use a different economic model, it is their sovereign right to use external service providers for some public service roles. In that case we would be accountable for compliance with the rules on public procurement and concessions, and particularly the rules on transparency. That was my intention when I tabled certain texts on public procurement and concessions, but I am totally committed to each country having this freedom of choice, particularly when it comes to protecting public services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank Mr Schwab and Mr Buşoi for raising the matter of implementation again, as did Mr Mavroyiannis. I am encouraged on this matter by Mr Van Rompuy and the European Council’s call for the rapid, concrete implementation by Europe’s governments of many of the texts we have presented and, along with you and the Commission, I will be ensuring that we can reach proper agreements over the next few weeks or months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Bufton, earlier on, and Ms Mazej Kukovič mentioned the very important external dimension of the single market. We are not alone. We must continue to be open to trade as a continent, but without the naivety of which we have demonstrated too much in the past. We need to take a good look at the rest of the world, which sometimes still hopes Europe will be there but no longer expect us to be, whether it is Brazil, China, the United States of America or India.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So let us consolidate the single market. Honourable Members, I can assure you that when you are in these big countries – I was in Brazil last week – you find that the only reason why they have respect for Europeans is because of the scale of the single market with its 500 million consumers and 22 million companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While I am on the subject of the rest of the world, Mr Alves, I have not forgotten the place or role of the outermost regions. As part of the follow-up to the report by Mr Solbes on Europe’s Outermost Regions and the Single Market, which I commissioned, we are preparing some more specific but very practical measures for State aid and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While I am also on the subject of consumer and citizen protection, I can reiterate to Mr Kósa that I am very concerned about the daily living conditions of disabled people. That is why I have asked the Council for a mandate to launch a discussion on the issue of intellectual property and to discuss an exception for people who are hard of hearing; I am an active supporter of the social enterprise sector, as you know. Many companies are in fact oriented towards disabled people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can tell Mr Karas, who spoke about citizen and consumer protection, that I believe every citizen is necessary in the battle for the single market and competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So there we are, honourable Members. Mr Paška and Mr Moreira mentioned the completion of the single market in employment. This is also one of our proposals in the Single Market Act II, most notably the development of a European public recruitment service, with EURES. There are not enough online curriculum vitae. We are going to increase this capacity considerably and also encourage cross-border recruitment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, not with propaganda – this was the word used by Mr Ferreira but I do not think he was right – or smugness, but simply with pride in the work done by our predecessors along the lines of Jacques Delors’s proposal for a single market, let us look ahead and open up the debate with Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over the last few days, many of us have taken part in discussions as part of Single Market Act Week – Ms Thun und Hohenstein mentioned the one in Warsaw. We have had lots of discussions. I was talking with Mr Harbour about the success of the 90-92 generation, where we saw young people who had plenty to say. We need to listen to people. I would like it if – including at the Commission – we could change the ‘top down’ way we communicate, as if we were saying ‘we are always right in Brussels’. That is not true. There are masses of ideas, criticisms and suggestions that should come from the bottom up.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Along the lines of what we did for the first time with Single Market Act Week, I am going to be taking other initiatives with my colleagues to open the debate with European citizens, where we ask those on the ground, consumers, unions, professionals and small businesses, to put forward their ideas. I am repeating what Ms Corazza Bildt and Ms Sehnalová said: a debate for citizens, a cultural dimension, Mr Schwab. Cultural means with citizens. It means not only talking technical, about money and laws, but also asking for people’s opinions. Many of you have taken part in these debates, and I am going to be taking other high-profile initiatives, particularly through social networks and the internet, to open up this crucial, interactive debate on the future and the consolidation of the single market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I should like first to say thank you for this excellent debate. It was a very constructive debate and a debate that showed that the single market really is a great achievement of the European project. I welcome the presence of Mr Mavroyiannis and his participation in this debate; I am grateful to fellow members for their constructive approach – some of them taking a sceptical stance, which is understandable – and heartily thank Commissioner Barnier for the dedication and enthusiasm he brings to the debate on these questions, on these issues of the internal market and of the political will to solve them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We still have many answers to give citizens. They are dissatisfied and disillusioned and expect more of us, more of the Council, more of the Commission and more of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This balance sheet is very useful, this 20-year review is important but, as many have said here, it is important to open the door in order to look towards the future. And looking towards the future involves many questions raised here and many measures already announced by the European Commission. The digital single market, the mobility of citizens, the EURES reform, the European energy market, provide eloquent examples of how far we still have to go in the future and how important and vital the path we take is in responding to this period of crisis in which we are living.</p>
      <p sl="pt">People are suffering; the public expect a great deal of politicians and of the responses that politicians are able to give to the hardships they are enduring. It is therefore important that the single market should be one of the responses to the great challenge of competitiveness, employment and economic growth. I am sure that all of us, after the celebration of these 20 years, are better equipped to provide the responses that our citizens need.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The creation of the single market should be one of the EU’s most significant achievements, and its tangible benefits should already be enjoyed by EU citizens and companies. However, until now, Member States, especially those that are more powerful economically, have been practising protectionist policies and genuine competition is still not present in the domestic market. Successful operation of such a market is directly dependent on the appropriate implementation of other EU political goals. On the subject of agriculture, farmers in some countries, including the Baltic States, still cannot make use of the benefits of the single market as they do not compete in agriculture under equal conditions, in particular because of small direct payments. In the areas of scientific research and innovation, scientists from different countries participating in European projects are subjected to different rules. In particular, they receive lower payments for the same work. There is still no transparent and uniform public procurement system. Small and medium-sized enterprises do not enjoy favourable conditions for obtaining financing. I believe that in the current crisis we should be making use of every opportunity to strengthen the single market in the EU and all of its potential for growth and employment. Therefore, I would like to encourage the Commission to take concrete actions and provide the necessary proposals for removing existing barriers that prevent the single market from functioning.</p>

      <p sl="de">The EU single market is one of the most worthwhile European achievements. Between 1992 and 2008 it created about 2.77 million jobs and increased GDP by 2.13 %. These figures clearly show the potential of a smoothly functioning EU single market. The 20 years of its existence that we are now celebrating is an anniversary of which all Europeans should be proud. However, past achievements should motivate us to remove any remaining obstructions. As the rapporteur has clearly shown us, some things in the single market are still in dire straits. The Commission has also produced a working paper containing the 20 main concerns of citizens that they consider impede the everyday smooth operation of the single market to no purpose. The problem areas identified must be solved using an integrated approach. Another problem concerns the issue of how we can ensure that every European citizen can benefit from the achievements of the EU single market, no matter where they live. The trade balance deficits within the EU may in the long term create difficulties for the Union. European policy must steer us in the opposite direction.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The 20th anniversary of the launch of the single market is an opportunity to reflect on the obstacles that prevent European citizens from fully enjoying their fundamental rights. An eloquent example is the right to freedom of movement, which is, unfortunately, still restricted by protectionist measures. If European citizens and consumers represent the core of the European project, measures taken at European level must facilitate their access to the labour market and at the same time give them the fundamental freedom to move freely within the territory of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For that reason, I believe that the time has come for us to talk about a relaunch of the single market which will lead to genuine inclusion and restore the faith of European citizens in this market. I welcome the steps taken thus far by the European Commission in this direction, but I urge the European executive to be more resolute in penalising the protectionist tendencies of certain Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European single market has a handsome track record of 500 million consumers, 21 million businesses, EUR 2 800 billion of trade within the EU and EUR 1 500 billion of global trade. It has transformed the way we live, buy things, work, learn and travel.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, the rights of millions of European citizens, who can do these things in the country of their choosing, are protected by European law in all Member States. The implementation in practice of the idea of a single market has made it possible, and is still making it possible, to improve this process constantly. This is precisely why I support the idea that European citizens must become increasingly involved in the decision-making process, and in 2013 the European Year of Citizens will be a good opportunity for them to speak their minds about their wishes and dreams.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Single Market is one of the most tangible results of European integration for citizens. Yet, despite the significant accomplishments, the present dynamics of the market still do not match what citizens expect of it. In the midst of the economic and financial crisis, a well functioning Single Market is needed more than ever. Europe needs a policy for growth and employment and I strongly believe that the Single Market is key to sustainable recovery. Therefore we should aim for a Single Market that stimulates economic growth and job creation but also considers citizens’ hopes, fears and expectations. Ultimately, it is always the citizens who will define change and who will make things happen. The levels of success of the Single Market will be gauged by the degree of support and trust it will get from the average anonymous citizen. The Single Market should be holistic in its concept and structure, thus achieving a balance between an open economy stimulating economic growth and job creation and an economic system fully integrating citizens’ concerns and at the same time giving a human face to the market by championing citizens’ interests, protecting consumers’ rights and enabling SMEs to compete effectively.</p>

      <p sl="hu">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, please allow me briefly to highlight the concerns of citizens on energy and telecommunications, and recommend solutions to improve the position of small and medium-sized enterprises. The main source of consumer dissatisfaction in the energy sector is that energy bills are too complicated and they do not provide information on why energy prices have risen in recent times. Regulations in many Member States are very accommodating, and so the energy providers are not compelled to provide consumers with appropriate information. To protect consumer rights properly the Member States must transpose EU legislation into practice as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The biggest problem with telecommunications is the quality of internet service, while prices and service packages are also very difficult to compare. With a view to monitoring service quality and prices we need to reinforce the role of the regulatory authorities and the consumer protection bodies, ensuring transparency. Small and medium-sized enterprises have problems in accessing financial assistance from Member States and the EU. SMEs find it difficult to access tender information, and they have no employees with experience in writing bids. Consequently it would be a great help for SMEs if Member States were to introduce ‘one-stop-shop administration’ for drawing EU and government financial assistance.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, the single market changed the lives, work and travel of European citizens, becoming an integral part of our lives. Enterprises were given the opportunity to cross borders into other European markets. Without the single market there is no European Union; this is the basis of the prosperity that makes Europe stronger. We have to do everything we can for the single market to continue flourishing, so that our children can live in a safe Europe in 20 years’ time, with greater access to what they value. To this end, what do we have to do? We have to open up our minds to let creativity and knowledge flow freely, resulting in innovation and growth. We have connected our transport networks, and now we have to connect our energy and telecommunication networks too, which will ultimately connect 500 million Europeans. We have to create a unified Europe that will be there for our grandchildren, but also one in which the young people entering the labour market just now do not feel like a ‘lost generation’ either. Ladies and gentlemen, let us dream big, let us dream about a unified and flourishing Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Single Market is the very essence of European integration. In 20 years intra-European trade has been expanded by four times, as has the FDI between EU countries. Yet we are continuously faced with non-implementation of existing EU directives. About 150 bottlenecks still cause serious distortion and fragmentation in the functioning of the European market. The new Member States find the resistance to opening the services market especially disappointing and demoralising. This reflects in the nutshell the major problems and internal contradictions of the EU – insufficient political commitment coupled with short-term national preferences over the common good. Simply enhancing the role of the Commission to enforce the directives will not solve the problem. The EU first needs to address two dramatic weaknesses: 1. the alarmingly insufficient and unequal level of competitiveness motivating several Member States to protectionism instead of conducting genuine structural reforms; 2. failure to fully understand that in the present demographic situation, where only 2-3 taxpayers are left for one retired person, the model of the established welfare state is not and will not be sustainable. We need to complete the Single Market as fast as possible, to boost the economy; this also means launching the Digital Single Market without delay!</p>

      <p sl="de">Twenty years after the birth of the free single market, the principles of free movement of goods, people, capital and services exist only as small beginnings, and these small beginnings have already managed to throw Europe into a serious crisis. The liberalisation of the capital market envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty under the motto of market self-regulation brought about the current bank/euro/economic crisis. Still the EU does not realise that its strength lies in the variety of its different economic cultures existing side by side. Despite this, we are hell-bent on centralisation and standardisation – the so-called harmonisation. Already a call is coming for further deregulation and more competition in the railway sector, since, it is said, only this can ensure better quality and falling prices. It is just that European-born citizens have had completely different experiences as consumers. The wrong approach of centralisation and inflation of the Brussels bureaucracy must end, as must the standardisation that contributed to the current crisis. The planned banking supervision is to be welcomed in principle but will not be able to make any substantial contribution to ending the euro crisis, since this requires a total reform of the currency union.</p>

      <p sl="en">The main concern of European citizens about the functioning of the Single Market is that it still does not fully function. Issues that were initially supposed to be water under the bridge long ago have not been properly addressed. For example, a digital signature was first mentioned in EU legislation as being equal to a physical signature already more than a dozen years ago. In many Member States it still remains a faint dream and very few steps are actually taken to adapt to the changing society and business environment of the 21st century. The EU needs to step up and promote the implementation of modern e-Services along with common standards in order to build a Digital Single Market and facilitate the interoperability of cross-border systems. Initiatives such as STORK 2.0 carry huge importance in achieving the necessary results. After addressing those issues and planning future activities, the Council and the Commission should make efforts to implement all legislation strictly and promptly in all Member States. The future of the Single Market should not depend on the good will of the slowest, but on the coherent hard work of all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="el">The free circulation of goods is the cornerstone of the EU. The single market is an essential element in implementing the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, as the Commission’s report emphasises, there are gaps and malfunctions in the working of the single market which prevent Europeans from making full use of it. The single market needs to be given a new breath of life, placing citizens and European consumers at the heart of its concerns, so that they can take full advantage of the benefits of this market and thus contribute to the territorial, economic and social cohesion of the European Union. I congratulate the rapporteur on the special importance she attaches to small and medium-sized enterprises, because an improvement in the entrepreneurship, internationalism and competitiveness of European SMEs, which are the backbone of the European economy, is of fundamental importance.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The single market is the conquest of our era. If our citizens and businesses have concerns, it is only because of a lack of information. I therefore agree with the call on the Commission to make use of all available technological resources in order to launch a dialogue with the citizens on the single market. We should inform the public of the advantages of the single market, practical and concrete solutions to their day-to-day problems, and their rights, and encourage them to participate in the creation of a competitive, fair and balanced market by organising information campaigns and by setting out the 20 main concerns.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Special attention should be paid to strengthening the Points of Single Contact project, in which it will be possible to provide information on conducting business in the Member States. I also agree with the call on the Commission to ensure that all citizens are entitled to obtain a European Health Insurance Card on request, to harmonise registration certificates for motor vehicles, and also to create a modern framework for the recognition of professional qualifications, which would contribute to increasing the competitiveness of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In October, 20 years on from the creation of the single market, the Commission adopted the Single Market Act II – ‘Together for new growth’. This document focuses on the development of networks that are fully integrated into the single market, the promotion of cross-border mobility for citizens and businesses, support for the digital economy right across Europe and the consolidation of social entrepreneurship, cohesion and consumer confidence.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The single market in the transport, energy and communications sector makes it necessary to eliminate the discrepancies between the transport, energy and communications infrastructures of the States which acceded to the EU with effect from 1 May 2004 and the infrastructures of the other Member States. In addition, since the single market is based on the mobility of citizens, I request that the barriers to the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers be removed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, one of the medium-term objectives of the European Union and the Member States should be a shift towards e-government, especially in terms of its cross-border dimension. The implementation of electronic public procurement across the whole of the EU could generate savings of at least EUR 100 billion a year for public finances. I am in favour of supplementing the framework for the modernisation of EU public procurement standards by making electronic invoicing the standard method of invoicing in public procurement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Many obstacles continue to exist in the European Union which prevent people from deriving full benefit from the existence of a single market, and from being able to take advantage of the right to free movement. Some problems require special attention from the European Commission. Businesses continue to run up against problems in gaining access to public procurement in other Member States. This applies as much to contractors as to sub-contractors. The cause is an excessive differentiation between national practices, plus complicated administrative requirements in individual countries, along with the language barriers that still exist in official organisations, which hinder the promotion of linguistic variety in the EU. Something else that would make it easier to get the best out of the EU labour market is simplification and acceleration of procedures relating to the refund of treatment costs abroad and care, so that health and social insurance systems take the necessary steps to provide citizens who are mobile with the necessary health care. Greater mobility on the part of skilled employees may make the European economy more competitive. For this to happen, we must adopt an up-to-date model of occupational skills recognition. It needs emphasising that movement of employees between Member States must be voluntary and must go hand in hand with full respect for employee rights. Any discrimination in any Member State with regard to origin or national affiliation is unacceptable. Removal of these obstacles, in particular, will enable Europeans to benefit from the positive aspects of membership of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Council fully shares the view that Europe’s economic prospects are very much reliant on skilled and adequately-educated human capital and that the Lifelong Learning Programme – including the Erasmus Programme – is one of the most successful European programmes in the educational sector. Therefore, let me assure you that the financing of the Lifelong Learning Programme in 2012 and 2013 will not be put in danger.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning 2012, the Council has started analysing the Commission’s proposals as presented in draft amending budget No 6/2012 and will adopt its position on this draft amending budget as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the appropriations for 2013 are concerned, these will be decided jointly by the European Parliament and the Council during the ongoing budgetary negotiations. I am confident that the two arms of the budgetary authority will reach a balanced agreement on the 2013 budget in November, as foreseen by the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, concerning the future of the Lifelong Learning Programme, including Erasmus, you all know that the negotiations concerning the next multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 are still in progress. The European Parliament is involved in these negotiations. The Presidency will make every effort to move the negotiations on the Programme along, but it would not be in order for me to say more than that at this stage, since we need to wait for the outcome of those negotiations.</p>

    <intervention id="4-088-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, recently there has been a lot of speculation and a lot of question marks and uncertainty regarding the fate of the Erasmus programme, including in the media. Therefore the Commission welcomes this opportunity to clarify the matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is also my duty to place the problem of Erasmus, as one single programme, in the more panoramic view of what is really a shortage of funds in the European budget not only for Erasmus – this is only a part of the problem, one of the smallest but most visible parts of the problem, we are encountering in 2012. This is due to the systematic under-budgeting in the annual budget. The major deficiencies in 2012 are in the Social Fund and in regional policy and rural development, but also in our external obligations, which reflects on the credibility of the European Union vis-à-vis our partners around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why we are coming forward with the amending budget for this year. There is a large amount of money is needed not only for cohesion and for rural development, but also for external obligations and especially for Heading 1a which concerns competitiveness, covering all sorts of research programmes including Lifelong Learning. Erasmus is part of Lifelong Learning which, as you know, is also about vocational training, possibilities for adults and for schools, and the most sensitive part of that concerns student mobility, namely Erasmus.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need in order to overcome the deficiencies for this year under this heading of research, training and education amounts to more than six million euros. For Lifelong Learning, which covers all sorts of programmes, our estimate is for EUR 180 million up to the end of the year, including Erasmus, which accounts for half this amount – more or less EUR 90 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your commitment to vocational mobility around Europe is also very important because, alongside this year’s problem, what is at stake here is the future of these programmes, indeed the future of the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. Education is very high on our common agenda due to the very high unemployment among the younger generation. Therefore, knowing how to acquire the right mix of skills is essential in order to place the younger generation in a decent European labour market; the future of what we call Erasmus for All is also at stake.</p>
      <p sl="en">But to return to the issue of Erasmus 2012-2013. I think Parliament was right to ring the alarm bell for Erasmus for this year, and here is the brutal truth: 99 % of what we have in our pocket – the European budget – has already been delivered to the national agencies around Europe. Of course we are contacting not only the national agencies in the European Union but a total of 33 participating countries, including Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Turkey, Croatia and Switzerland. 99 % of what was available for 2012 has already been delivered to the 33 national agencies. We have already had claims for this year of around EUR 160 million, and we expect more claims for 2012. I think that it is easier to say who is not applying for additional money: Portugal, Finland, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. The other countries are applying and sending requests for additional money. Therefore, an amendment to this year’s budget is essential.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to repeat that what we have estimated we need for all sorts of educational programmes for this year is EUR 180 million. What we need for Erasmus is half that: EUR 90 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, Minister Mavroyiannis is right. It is our duty to ensure the smooth implementation of Erasmus in 2012 and early 2013, as we have already advanced a lot of money to the national agencies. But if there are no more funds coming in, we will really encounter a very serious accumulation of problems in 2013, as the universities are less likely to deliver to the students and are likely to reduce the expectations for student mobility in 2013. This is why I urge you to help us. This is also a kind request to the Presidency: to deliver a substantial increase for 2012 and not to have an accumulation of problems in this very valuable European Union programme in 2013. Together we can manage.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened to you carefully but it is just that I cannot believe you! Why are we here today? It is an admission of incapacity by the governments responsible – not the Commission and not Parliament! We need to clearly state what this is about: it is not about an increase in resources because the Commission did not do its work properly, it is solely about the States not meeting the obligations they have made to young people</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">who want to study abroad because their parents, the economy, society and politicians tell them every Sunday how important education is and how important it is to gain experience abroad. Through the Bologna Process, a technical failure, Member States have unnecessarily made students’ lives more difficult. Now they are also setting about damaging the reputation of the flagship project of European educational policy, Erasmus, completely unnecessarily. Already, the year abroad is a financial balancing act for many young people on Erasmus. If the impression is now given that they cannot even rely on these commitments, this is a devastating signal, especially for those who desperately depend on support from Erasmus.</p>
      <p sl="de">Education ministers have stated repeatedly − and re-stated now − that the goal for 2020, that many young people are able to go abroad and be mobile, must be achieved. What are we to think if, because of a lack of funding, not even 5 % of Erasmus students can go abroad now?</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I think that the budget reorganisers, that is, the Council representatives, should not reorganise the budget at the expense of students. In this matter, at least, they should be generous – it is also their own children’s future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when I studied in Vienna I did not have the possibility of Erasmus at that time and I still deplore the fact that I did not have the possibility. Normally young people in Europe have the possibility – still have the possibility – but even that is now endangered for some of them. In Europe we speak about the necessity for excellence, for high qualifications, of knowing other languages – and the Erasmus programme is in danger. In Europe all the leaders speak about the necessity of mobility. We cannot stick to one place in one country in one city alone – and some of our nation states are endangering mobility. And we speak in Europe about the necessity of having a European identify in addition to the national or regional identity – and again, some of our leaders are endangering the European identity.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also very interesting to see that some of the countries where most of the students want to enter the Erasmus programme are trying to cut the budget, and that is absolutely unacceptable. I fully agree with what the Commissioner said. Thank you very much for your engagement on that. Thank you, Mr Mavroyiannis. You are a very gentle and kind person, but sometimes I think you have to be less kind to your colleagues in the other governments because what they are doing is absolutely impossible. As my colleague said, they are endangering one of the biggest flagships of European unification, of European identity, of coming together, of being the most qualified Europe – and then we endanger this programme. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially at a time when euroscepticism is growing. We say to the young people who want to be real Europeans: sorry, we do not have the money. I think again you sometimes have to be very tough with your colleagues and tell them that the unanimous opinion here in this Parliament is that we need Erasmus and we need enough financing for our young people, because this is about Europe, not about national ambitions.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, thank you for the remarks that have been made thus far. I wholeheartedly agree with them. I have two comments on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in connection with this. Firstly, there is of course the matter pertaining to unpaid bills. Where I come from, we pay our bills. This is not a matter that is up for discussion. I simply do not understand this discussion in connection with the consistent under-budgeting, which the Commission was also party to. I feel the time is absolutely right! We are in a situation where we discuss this every single time, and citizens simply do not understand the lack of logic in this consistent under-budgeting. Bills must be paid! We are in a situation where the work has been done and the money has been allocated, and now the bill must be paid. Naturally, our credibility as institutions will stand or fall based on whether or not these bills are paid. And of course, this also concerns the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="da">Secondly, this must be expected to affect students. We now face the obvious risk that students across the Member States will not receive a grant at all or at least not the grant they were expecting, or that their grants will be cut. This is the actual situation that we are faced with. It is not a trivial matter, and it is a cold, hard reality and not an abstract situation for the young people concerned.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to strongly advise against taking this programme, which several speakers have emphasised as being one of the most popular specific programmes that we have in the EU, hostage in a situation where there is a tactical game between institutions as to whether this ‘budget loss’ should be assigned to one institution or another. I would like to strongly advise against taking young people and a popular programme hostage. This specifically also concerns the level of confidence in this project among citizens, and here at last is a project that people understand, one where we hear again and again, across political boundaries, that it is beneficial to the EU. This is one of the reasons why people understand that this project is something that is worth being united over. It is this that hangs in the balance. It is not simply a question of some incidental money in a budget; it is about confidence in the entire project. Therefore, I would strongly recommend that the Council and the Cyprus Presidency firmly encourage colleagues to come forward with the money. Thank you for the opportunity to speak!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lewandowski, unfortunately it is right and necessary that we sound the alarm bells today. We have got a terrible situation with regard to the Erasmus programme: students no longer have the grant money that was promised to them. This runs absolutely counter to the aims − and here I direct myself to you, Sir, the representative of the Cyprus Presidency − which the Council and Parliament agreed, namely to do more for Erasmus, more for student mobility and more for the education and training of our young people. How can we be so short-sighted and irresponsible as to undermine one of the most successful programmes we have ever had in the European Union? Ms Pack was right to say that we already have an implementation rate of 99 % − and this was in October! What more do you want? We would do better to make cuts to, say, tobacco subsidies, which do a lot of damage, not to a programme from which, as we know, everyone involved can only benefit.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have breached a contract. You promised money that you are now not supplying. This undermines the credibility of the European Council and, unfortunately, also that of the entire European Union. It is a serious political mistake.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is not only the Erasmus flagship programme that is under pressure: the European Social Fund, for example, has no more money either. Do you know what you are risking here? This year there is no more money for literacy courses or upskilling the long-term unemployed. This is totally contrary to what you are always saying at your summit meetings: that we must do more to counter youth unemployment, that we must encourage young people to get out and about in Europe, broaden their skills and get further training. Stop this irresponsible policy and let us approve a supplementary budget. Above all, let us approach the next multiannual financial framework boldly and make this money available for European education policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, you have not alleviated our concerns. As you can see, all four voices – Ms Pack, Mr Swoboda, Mr Løkkegaard and Ms Trüpel – are essentially expressing concern at the situation, and this concern is justified. In fact, these calculations that you have provided have not alleviated our concerns, because this is one of those programmes in which it is worth investing. The European Union hands out a great deal of money quite needlessly, and Ms Trüpel has drawn attention to one such area – that is the truth. It is very common for the European Union to waste money, but the money intended for the Erasmus programme is very much money not wasted. It is the best-invested money in the EU, and we should therefore make every effort – above all the Commission, but the Council too – to ensure that this money does not run short.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is especially because the division into better and worse continues to prevail, as the size of grants unfortunately continues to reflect the division of Europe. They depend on which country one comes from. A Polish student studying in Germany or France is not, sadly, provided with the same conditions as a German or French student studying in Poland. This is an element we must overcome. The question of credits is also worthy of support, but the most important thing is to make sure this money does not run out. We cannot stand in shame before our citizens, and before our students, because the European Union has not found the money for one of the flagship, vanguard and best-implemented programmes. I must entreat you, Commissioner, to make every effort to prevent this situation from arising, and to make sure that European students have the money to enable them to study abroad.</p>

      <p sl="es">What is more, European and social cohesion are also being put at risk, which to some extent is creating a two-speed Europe, which we are not prepared to accept; the whole of the educational community must operate under the same conditions and at the same level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Erasmus started 25 years ago, and three million people have taken part. During the period 2007-2013 the EU has paid out grants worth EUR 3 billion on Erasmus. However, the economy has shrunk and youth unemployment has grown massively to 11.7 %. Furthermore, the grant gives an average EUR 300 per month, which is insufficient to cover the basic costs of living. If we add travel costs to this we can estimate that a family needs to pay at least EUR 5 000 per year on top of the grant to cover the total cost of one of its members doing Erasmus.</p>
      <p sl="en">How many families can afford this in these times of crisis? Considering the lack of impact on employment and economic growth that the Erasmus programme has had over the last decade, and given that it can only be afforded by those that are well off, we should scrap it. There are many other priorities that need more urgent attention. Those who find it indispensable to have this development should pay out of their own pocket instead of imposing the burden on the taxpayer.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate before this one was on the 20th anniversary of the single market. We had that debate because the single market is one of the European Union’s main goals. If the single market were to fail, the entire European Union could fail.</p>
      <p sl="it">The same is true of Erasmus: for many young people – and not only for them – it represents the image of the European Union. Without Erasmus, many people’s perception of European unity would disappear. This is more the case than with the single market because with the single market there is also, but not only, an economic advantage for businesses and for our countries. There is nothing wrong with this, but Erasmus is different, it is about students wanting to break out of their confines and discover the cultures of other countries, share the experience of studying with people who speak a different language and perhaps have different customs and traditions, and discover, renew and strengthen our common identity and our unity.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is how Europe came into being, not through treaties or dreadful bureaucracy, but through genuine lived experiences. Perhaps without Erasmus, the single market would also mean something different, the spirit of it would be different and so weakening Erasmus could weaken our Union. The title of this debate is absolutely right: Erasmus is in danger, and the danger is that, without Erasmus, a different concept of Europe would develop.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and to tell the Council to make a real effort to find and authorise the funds, since the hole that exists is down to the Member States. The Europe of the future will depend on those who want to study and have experiences abroad now. Let us try not to let them down and let us be brave enough to show what Europe is really made of. I wish the Council good luck with its work and hope to hear only good news!</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in recent times we have been flooded by various headlines about the end of the Erasmus programme, and these have been the cause of growing insecurity among students and families. Today’s debate is essential in the attempt to reassure European citizens that the European institutions led by the European Parliament are actively cooperating, and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the EU budget in no way jeopardises the effectiveness of Erasmus, which is one of the most successful EU programmes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Using it as an example, we can highlight the challenges and risks of the austerity measures that several Member States would like to apply to the EU budget. When we speak today about the importance of ensuring adequate funding for Erasmus, we are also spreading the message that even in these times of crisis Europe is prepared to invest in education and training, and therefore in programmes that are key to its economic and social recovery. We must strive to ensure that a similar situation is not repeated in the future. It is a matter of trust in the European institutions; the solution that we are able to find will reflect the importance that Europe places on education, training and mobility in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore call on the Council of the European Union to cooperate with Parliament and the Commission in order to reach a satisfactory solution to the negative balance of payments in the budget for 2012 and especially the Erasmus programme.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Council representatives present have underlined the many problems there are in 2012 and also concerning the future funding of Erasmus, but have not given any firm answers. The question being put to the Member States today, on which there is a consensus in Parliament, is this: are you going to increase your contributions to its funding to meet the commitments you have made? Quite apart from Erasmus, the issue of funding for education programmes and also for the Cohesion Fund is equally tragic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Personally, I am a supporter of independent financing of the EU budget, which would liberate us from the Member States’ erratic decision-making.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Erasmus certainly has its limitations but it is one of the EU measures that makes people, and particularly young people, appreciate the idea of Europe. It is a measure that creates a Europe of sharing and cooperation, and not a Europe of competition, a dog-eat-dog Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the European institutions were really bothered about the general interest of citizens, we would not be here now discussing restrictions and drastic cuts, but instead we would be working together to provide more scholarships to ensure that Erasmus does not only affect 3 % or 4 % of EU students, students already facing considerable financial hardship. Under these circumstances, the worst-case scenario would be the replacement of the current system with a system of loans, meaning that students would start their working lives saddled with an extra financial burden.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want Europe to get through the crisis, we need to be aiming for a considerably higher level of training, and for a colossal research effort. It is therefore our responsibility to ensure that the Erasmus programme is not only saved but also developed and is fit to meet the challenges of our times. Similarly, the programme should be extended to the continuing training of employees so that, EU-wide, we create security of jobs and training for all employees in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Erasmus programme should be defended tooth and claw for the rights and future of our young people. It would be much better to cut the super-high pay and pensions of our senior officials, those untouchables of the European Union, or to reduce the gifts to high finance and the banking system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some practical suggestions have been made by young people involved in Erasmus. During the Erasmus Day Live initiative, some suggestions were made to President Barroso such as exchanging homes, which could make it easier and less expensive for families, or introducing some working hours (young people want to work, and they could do so in libraries and archives, or in cultural institutions), and regionalisation. Some regions like my own, Piedmont, have suggested intervening along the lines of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let us expand the basis for participation in Erasmus, let us give young people the role of offering suggestions and taking action. Erasmus is important. We critics of Europe are more supportive of Erasmus than some pro-Europeans, who want to cut not high-level bureaucracy, not costs or waste – good heavens, no! – but the things that serve the future of young people in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Ms Pack has already said, we are very concerned that it was even thinkable to create dramatic and unacceptable impacts – on education, on training in Europe – by making cuts in the wrong place. It is clear that the strongest weapon against the unemployment crisis and, obviously, for the competitiveness of Europe, is to be found in education. A mainstay of European policy success, as Mr Scurria rightly said, just as valuable as the single market and the euro, is being jeopardised here. This is unacceptable. We should never again – and I am hoping for a happy ending – have to hear sheepish statements from the Commission such as those in the press release of 15 October, which stated that the financial resources for Erasmus until the end of the year could not be guaranteed because the Council could not get its act together and accept its responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, two days ago here in this House we held a debate on the budgets for 2013 and, among other things, I highlighted the problems that we could have next year with payments if the Council does not accept the Commission’s proposal and Parliament’s position.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today in this debate on Erasmus, we are not talking about what could happen next year but what is happening now, and the reality is that, because the position of the Commission and Parliament was not accepted last year, this year if this is not resolved a large number of programmes, including Erasmus, could find themselves in trouble.</p>
      <p sl="es">The President-in-Office of the Council says that that is not going to happen, that there are not going to be payment problems: they told us the same thing last year and now we do not believe them. I am sorry, but they told us they were going to provide sufficient funds, that there would be no problems, and this year the Commission has had to put forward a EUR 9 billion amending budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that Erasmus is not in danger and that we are still in time to save it, which is easy to do: you simply need to accept the proposal of the Commission and Parliament so that this does not happen again.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, at a time when every European government is saying that unemployment among young people entering the labour market is double the level in other age groups, is not the information that Erasmus is under threat, or the behaviour of the European Council, proof of extreme irresponsibility? Soon we shall be hearing from these young people – and this does not surprise me in the least – the question: so what are we needed for anyway, at the end of the day? We are sorting out our own problems, but we are not sorting out the problems of the people of Europe. It is not only because of the crisis that Europe is in a situation where every day it has to prove to its citizens that they need it. With this signal that the Council is giving, we are proving that we are needed by ourselves. But we are not in any way needed by the people of Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Commissioner Lewandowski and to Mr Lamassoure; were it not for their voices, Erasmus would be quietly dying and no one would be talking about it. I am surprised at Mr Migalski, with what seems to be his complaint against Commissioner Lewandowski – we are in a situation today where the Council and the Commission must speak with one voice in order to find a solution to this problem. I am pleased that the European Parliament is taking such a unified stance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">May I remind you, Madam President, and through you Parliament’s authorities, that in Council Directive 89/654/EEC we established the conditions in which employees should work in Europe, and that directive also mentions the minimum temperature that should prevail at the workplace. I am not entirely sure that that temperature is prevailing in this Chamber – I am talking here about the temperature, not the political atmosphere – the physical temperature that prevails with us here.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we really cannot make young people bear the cost of the crisis. Of course we are in an economic crisis and need to cut waste. We should start by getting rid of Parliament’s second seat, to set an example as much as anything else. We should not be touching the funds for actions and projects that work. First among these is Erasmus, which has enabled millions of young people in Europe – and I want to emphasise that these have often been young people without great financial prospects – to have an extraordinary experience of study and vocational training, that can help their entry into the world of work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Jobs are becoming increasingly inaccessible to young people. In Europe, one young person in four is unemployed. This figure is constantly bandied about in this Chamber. To the young people who are watching us, who are following this debate, we should be saying: ‘We’re not touching Erasmus!’ and the European institutions should be doing their utmost to make this possible.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ERASMUS, in the commonly held view of all of us, is one of the most successful EU programmes, a programme which is synonymous with the European enterprise. Therefore, by discussing today whether this programme is in danger, we are once again casting doubt upon ourselves. I remind you that we did the same in the previous period on the question of the Schengen area, and this is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="el">Continuing what my fellow Members have said, then, I would like to ask all young people, all students throughout Europe, in the 33 countries participating in this programme, to continue sending their applications. They should rest assured that everything will go smoothly. I would also like to express warm thanks to the teachers and all those involved in implementing the programme, who, often at personal sacrifice, ensure that everything works smoothly, because it has been said often enough before that ‘ERASMUS funding is inadequate’.</p>
      <p sl="el">Governments have made mistakes. That is why we – the European Parliament, the European Commission – are here, to show that we are not going to discuss the obvious again.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sending disconcerting, destabilising messages to Europe’s young people is not a great way to celebrate 25 years of Erasmus. The 33 countries involved in the Erasmus programme and the two and a half million students who have so far had the opportunity of studying abroad deserve certainty.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is unthinkable that the reason that this programme is in crisis is its success, including in terms of the funding already used. We need to be aware that the entire lifelong learning programme accounted for just 0.7 % of the EU budget in the last seven-year period, and we are talking about seeking an increase of 65 % or 75 % for the next seven-year period.</p>
      <p sl="it">We would be giving a completely mixed message if we were to say we could not honour our commitments.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the Erasmus programme is a flagship EU programme. After the free movement of people and goods, the Erasmus programme is regarded as one of the great achievements of the European Union. For that reason, Parliament supports an increase in the Union’s support for education and training over the 2014-2020 period in order to raise the level of citizens’ skills and help address the high levels of youth unemployment in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In view of the importance of education for the future of the Union, we request not only an increase in the budget for the Erasmus programme over the future financial period, but also the following: an increase in the number of people aged over 35 who benefit from lifelong learning, one of the programme’s overall objectives, along with an increase in the mobility of persons for educational purposes in the field of entrepreneurship, and therefore the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme; and making industrial policy one of the EU policies which are relevant to the Erasmus for All programme.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the foundation of Europe’s future rests upon the shoulders of our children and young people, and it can safely be said that even those parties who have a negative attitude towards EU cooperation are nevertheless of the opinion that the flagships of European success have been the education programmes and, above all, the Erasmus programme.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the sort of situation in which we find ourselves right now in the European Union, in the middle of this recession, what we need specifically is investment in education and mobility; everybody knows this. What does the market need? It needs a high-quality workforce; and we can only guarantee a high-quality workforce through education, and, as has been stated on many occasions already, Erasmus has been the success story here.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We are supposedly concerned about the trend towards exclusion; it is through education and investment that we oppose this trend, and therefore this is what is required. It will be very alarming if we now start to make cuts in this area. I do not believe that Cyprus, as Presidency, wishes its term of office to be remembered as one in which it had a Commissioner who was anti-education, and one which saw the start of a winding-down of the education programmes. This is not the way to go; we must invest in education, since only in this way will Europe have hopeful prospects for the future.</p>

I myself, like other young Members of this House, benefited from such a grant in the past.</p>
      <p sl="es">Erasmus has extended equality in education because it has also given many of us as young people the opportunity to go abroad when we otherwise would not have had the resources to do so, as this was previously a privilege reserved for the children of rich families. We are aware that there are differences in the amount of the grants, but I would like to ask the Council and the Commission how many students are affected and how it is going to be ensured that those students receive 100% of their grants.</p>

The Council must pay at the due date and time, honouring the commitments it made. The Council must be credible, trustworthy and exemplary.

(Thank you also for reminding us that Lewandowski was successful in scoring against Real Madrid yesterday for Borussia Dortmund!) But this is also very much an opportunity to see what is behind the figures. From time to time it is necessary to see what lies behind the budgetary figures. It is so easy to cut figures on paper, but when you see thousands of Erasmus students it is more difficult, or when you see the small or medium-sized companies behind the figures who are in desperate need of liquidity at a time of credit crunch, then it is less easy to cut the figures.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the case with Erasmus. It started with a modest allocation of EUR 18 million I think in 1998, but now more than 4 000 higher education institutions in 33 countries – also beyond the European Union – have signed up to the Erasmus University Charter. So this is really about visibility, about the utility of the European Union for the younger generation. Utility is what we really need now, the utility of our institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation is as follows, as I have clarified. You have my assurance, and I think this will also be endorsed by Minister Mavroyiannis, that the students benefiting from Erasmus this year, and at the beginning of 2013, are not in danger. Everything should be implemented, because we have sent money to the national agencies in 33 countries. The danger is due to uncertainty – especially if we make an additional request to take advantage of the money allocated for 2013 to cover the needs of 2012 – and uncertainty affects most of all those students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, poorer students around Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore we need a solution, we need your commitment. Please do not forget that Erasmus is only a part of the Lifelong Learning programme. The very prestigious Marie Curie programme for young researchers is also in danger of being short of money if we do not have an additional EU 100 million for this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the overall picture at a time when we are starting the battle over the future until 2020. It is not true that the research programmes are to be affected, they are the part of the European budget with the biggest growth for the future, from EUR 50 to 80 billion, but I think what is vital now is to give assurances to the students that in 2013 they will not be affected.</p>

      <p sl="en">It was estimated that around 270 000 students will participate in Erasmus this year. However, with the budgetary problems there are many students intending to undertake this programme in the coming months who are rightly very worried about this situation. Faced with the prospect of a shortage of funds, universities and colleges are likely to reduce the number of places available, or they will reduce the level of grants available. This will hit students from disadvantaged backgrounds hardest. I appreciate the efforts being made by the Commission and my colleagues in Parliament to address this situation, but the fact remains that the shortfall in the Erasmus programme amounts to EUR 90 million. If an agreement to increase payments cannot be reached, the Erasmus programme will be at risk, and students, adults and vocational training will all be affected.</p>

However, it appears that the recent austerity measures in the EU have put the financing of the programme at risk. Although the European Commission will recommend that the 2012 budget be supplemented in this area with the funds necessary to run Erasmus, if the Member States and Parliament are unable to agree on further payments then there will be no funds in the coming academic year to finance the students’ studies. I know that the lengthy economic crisis and therefore the fiscal austerity measures affect more or less every country in the Union, but I still call upon the Member States to support the Commission’s proposal, because if we do not ensure that the professionals of the future are properly trained, we will have no chance of recovering from the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Erasmus is one of the EU’s most successful programmes. It offers students significant educational benefits, giving them the opportunity to travel and come into contact with other cultures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, there is a risk that the programme will be affected by the inadequate financing of the Union’s budget. More than 1 500 foreign students come to Romania each year, and a further 4 500 young Romanians study in other EU Member States thanks to Erasmus scholarships. The large number of students bears witness to the programme’s success, and is further evidence that we need sufficient funds for the Union’s vital policies. We cannot sacrifice education policies when one of the main problems affecting the Union is high youth unemployment. We must encourage education and vocational training programmes to prepare young people to enter the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why the Youth of the European People’s Party sent a letter to the Heads of State or Government who attended the European People’s Party Congress in Bucharest in which it requested the latter’s support for an amended budget proposal to be presented by the Commission. The letter requested that the necessary funds be made available to enable beneficiaries to continue with projects in various fields. The letter is proof of the PPE Group’s commitment to adequate funding for the most important European policies.</p>

      <p sl="nl">With the amendment to the 2012 budget submitted by the European Commission a strong signal has been given to the Member States to comply with their commitments. In April of this year the EU education ministers again confirmed the objective by 2020 of allowing 20% of European students to spend a period studying abroad. Of course the necessary funds must be available for this purpose. For the Erasmus programme it is therefore absolutely essential that the EUR 90 million shortfall for 2012 be made up as soon as possible. This will avoid students receiving a small Erasmus grant or none at all. If an agreement is not made quickly it will be the least well-off students in particular who have to give up their foreign study experience. As a way out of the crisis the European Union must resolutely take action in respect of the education and employment of young people. Study abroad adds to the profile of students who have recently graduated. Year after year more students study abroad. Now that the Erasmus programme is fully underway it is not a good idea to put it on the back burner.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Erasmus forms part of the EU Lifelong Learning Programme and comprises actions intended to bring about European cooperation in the higher-education sector. At present, Erasmus gives mobility scholarships to thousands of students, with emphasis laid on the academic recognition of studies. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that in October 2009 the European Commission celebrated the fact that the number of Erasmus students at European level had reached 2 000 000. The Erasmus experience is a unique and personal intercultural and university experience, not only for those who have participated in the programme, but also for those who are motivated to sign up. The problem of financing is critical, especially at a time of economic crisis. The European Union must endeavour to put in place the funds necessary for the Erasmus programme to continue over the 2014-2020 period. ‘Social criteria’ must become part of the Erasmus grant award process to enable students on low incomes to benefit from periods of mobility without having to worry about the lack of adequate financial resources. Young people are the foundation of Europe, and it needs qualified young people. To that end, we need to invest in education so that young people can benefit from jobs that are appropriate to their qualifications.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Erasmus programme began 25 years ago and has already had approximately 3 million participants. It is one of the most popular and successful of Europe’s programmes and it is extremely important that it should continue to exist. It is a symbol of the EU and, since it is under threat, it will be the very unity of the EU which could be weakened. It is essential to agree a level of financing to ensure that this programme continues, since all the money applied would never be wasted but would be invested. It is a matter of investment in qualification, in the intellectual and cultural training of young people who will be the future of Europe. That being the case, it is unacceptable that the Erasmus programme should be under threat, since it is one of the most effective weapons for combating unemployment in Europe. The future of Europe and the credibility of the European Union are at stake; it is essential to fight for Erasmus; the amounts due must be paid and grants must be made available; young people must be provided with qualifications and incorporated into the labour market. I call upon the three institutions to strive to reach a satisfactory solution as swiftly as possible and I call upon the Council to set an example of discipline. It is not possible to refuse payments due for projects which were budgeted for and for which the appropriate legal authorisation was given.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Erasmus programme is one of the most successful of the dedicated programmes that were ever put forward for young people throughout Europe. It has worked very well to date, as proven by the fact that more than two million students have taken advantage of it so far. Above all it improves young people’s chances in the labour market, and provides an opportunity to spend time in a foreign country, get to know new people, gain new experience, study a language and raise one’s level of knowledge. Erasmus grant recipients become more tolerant, find out about their own abilities and also acquire the capacity to cope when far away from home. This programme can be a sort of introduction to adult life. It has the effect that those taking part become more self-assured, more mature and independent, and their plans for how they intend to spend their lives for the next few years become more focussed. The Erasmus programme is fulfilling its own objectives outstandingly well, as borne out in numerous statements and studies by its grant recipients and higher education institution authorities. Maintenance of its formula as hitherto applied along with the appropriate funding would appear to be a priority matter. We are currently looking at a new proposal from the Commission in this area. Its essential content is a matter for further discussion, but at this stage when it is being introduced, it is worth asking ourselves whether we should change something that is working so smoothly and to such benefit for all interested parties. As the proverb goes: better is the enemy of good. Let us not change what is good, then.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In an institutional context we very often discuss the problems of young Europeans, especially as regards their difficulties in starting out on a career path. It is less common for us to listen to young people, or to chat with them about their expectations. Instead of doing this, we propose new programmes, like Youth Guarantee, without consulting young people, and then these programmes are criticised by those young people and recognised as supporting occupational passivity. The cry from young people is ‘we need Youth Opportunities, not Youth Guarantees’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Erasmus programme is in fact one of these ‘Youth Opportunities’. It is one of Europe’s none-too-common great successes. It is hard to believe that we are now having to discuss savings in this programme. What we should decide today is to transfer all hitherto unused funds from 2007-2013 straight to this fine programme, and not look to make savings in it. Why is it that the Council and the Commission so frequently turn down such irrational paths?</p>

I make an urgent appeal to the Commission and the Member States which asked to pay EUR 5 million less and ought to bridge these gaps with funds which have not been accessed. This budget reduction will only increase the inequalities between young people, and the Erasmus programme will become a privilege for students who are in a better financial situation, instead of being a right for all. In addition, I would like to propose an expansion of the programme. This initiative could serve as a mechanism to promote the Erasmus brand outside Europe, too. Such a step would not only improve cooperation with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, but would also mean that funds would no longer be limited to the European area. The Erasmus programme is in jeopardy and we should not gamble with the future of young people.</p>

      <p sl="bg">It would be no exaggeration if we said that Erasmus was the most successful student exchange programme in the world. Its success is acknowledged to such an extent that it has become a symbol of a united Europe for millions of young people. Even mentioning the possibility of not having enough resources to run it is a blow to our trust in the EU. On top of that, it becomes clear from Commissioner Lewandowski’s statement that those affected would most likely be students with the least financial means. Let us spare a thought for the deep disappointment of a young person who finds out that because of the unfulfilled financial obligations of the ‘officials in Brussels’, he will not be able to feel free, and will not be able to travel on a par with other people of his own age; that he cannot be a true European, because somewhere the money has run out. One more thing: for many this Chamber has been a place where concern has been expressed about the burden this crisis is placing on young people, youth employment, the need for new policies … However, let us not undermine what we already have. The Erasmus programme has been with us for 25 years now, and it has become part of the cultural and educational experience of an entire generation. It has proven its effectiveness, which has far exceeded expectations. It is our duty to preserve and expand it.</p>

However, as a Member from an outermost region such as the Canary Islands, I am also concerned that our young people do not enjoy equal opportunities in the mobility measures financed by the EU. Young people from the Canary Islands cannot and should not be in a worse situation than other young people in the EU due to living in an outermost region. Youth unemployment figures in the outermost regions are really worrying and it is our duty to ensure that the additional cost of students travelling from their outermost region of origin is borne by the programme itself and not by the students, who often see this additional cost as an insurmountable obstacle that prevents them from accessing Erasmus grants. Yes there should be Erasmus for all, but that should include young people from the outermost regions.</p>

      <p sl="lt">It is disappointing that because of the lack of funds for 2012 budget allocations a significant number of very important and successful programmes such as Erasmus and scientific research and innovation programmes, are now at risk. The stable financing of Erasmus in next year’s budget also appears to be at risk, even though during the programme’s 25th anniversary we spoke about the need to provide additional funds for the programme in the next EU financing period 2014-2020. The youth unemployment level of recent years has clearly highlighted the importance of targeted measures that aim to reduce the division between education and the labour market, lower youth unemployment in the majority of Member States and encourage mobility and lifelong learning. It has to be noted that Erasmus is one of the most successfully implemented programmes and that it gives Europeans the opportunity to improve and strengthen bilateral cooperation in higher education. I am hoping that the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the funding of Erasmus and scientific research and innovation programmes will motivate the European Commission and the Member States, which undoubtedly understand the usefulness of these education and innovation policy instruments, to search for solutions regarding stable implementation of these programmes as well as regarding their security.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the resolute manner in which the European Parliament (on Tuesday) and the European Commission (on Wednesday) have said that they are in favour of continuing the Erasmus programme, leaping to the defence of the values that underpin it. Over the 25 years of its existence, Erasmus has enabled 2.5 million European students to travel, study in another country and get to know another European culture. Since 2000, they have included 35 000 Romanian students. I shall compare it with another European programme, which is the same age and has followed a similar development path: the EU Food Distribution programme, which was also established in 1987. This programme, from which 18 million citizens or more than 1 in 30 Europeans are currently benefiting, has been in danger over the last few years. I congratulate the European Commission on its initiative to create a fund to assist disadvantaged people in the European Union over the 2014-2020 period, which will replace the Food Distribution programme. Both programmes, Erasmus and the Food Distribution programme, which have now existed for a quarter of a century, are quintessential European programmes which must continue and develop.</p>

It is a symbol for European youth, and its perception of the European Union. It fosters mutual understanding and European unity: values on which the European Union is built.

      <p sl="hu">It is common knowledge that the Member States of the European Union are experiencing economic difficulties at present, yet I still believe it is unmerited for the Erasmus programme or the assistance for poorer regions from the Cohesion Fund to be put at risk on account of financing problems. The Erasmus programme is one of the milestones of the EU success story, and a further EUR 90 million is needed to ensure we continue these traditions. It means a lot to those who benefit: the opening of horizons, a unique opportunity to gain experience. Raising the funds for this in the EU budget is a justified endeavour because it is one of the projects that makes the benefits of the EU visible and tangible, and allows citizens to experience the specific advantages of the European Union. In essence, Erasmus signifies the transposition of European values into practice, just like the euro or the Schengen Area, or the unrestricted movement across borders. Interestingly, alongside the problems associated with the euro, some Member States are pressing for a reform of the Schengen Area, raising the notion of restricting free movement across borders at the very time when the financing of Erasmus is under threat. We have to concede that this is because it is insignificant compared to the stakes of the common budget or Europe’s debt crisis. It is quite unacceptable that we are jeopardising the most popular achievements of the Union with austerity measures, as we are only undermining the professional prospects of the coming generations and fostering euroscepticism among young people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Erasmus programme is without doubt one of the European Union’s greatest successes in the field of education. It provides thousands of students with an opportunity to take up studies in a variety of European countries. It enables people to find out about different education systems, to extend their knowledge of a foreign language, but also – and this is the most important thing of all – it constitutes a sphere for intercultural exchange between people from all over Europe. Particularly now, when the EU is grappling with a high level of youth unemployment, we cannot allow the Erasmus programme and the idea of student exchanges to be threatened by a shortage of funds. Young people cannot be expected to pay for the crisis. It needs emphasising that it is precisely mobility for students and the opportunity for them to acquire international experience that gives them a chance to find their feet in the labour market. Erasmus is our European identity and a very important element of the common market. That is why it is very important for Member States to fulfil their obligations so that there is no shortage of money for planned exchanges, or for the continued functioning of this programme. Member States should also bear this in mind when budget expenditure for the longer-term financial future is being discussed. We must not take a short-sighted view of this and seek savings that are needed now at the cost of the Erasmus programme, which will bring tangible benefits in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Erasmus programme is one of the most successful programmes at European level but is currently at risk for lack of EU funding. At a time of serious financial difficulties for young people, it is fundamental to continue to support the mobility of thousands of students between various countries. During negotiations on the EU budget for 2012, the Council decided to reduce payment authorisations by EUR 3 billion, having also undertaken to release the budgetary funds if it became necessary. During the current year the Council and the European Commission approved many projects in different areas such as the National Strategic Reference Framework, the common agricultural policy, the Fisheries Fund, Research and Innovation (Seventh Framework Programme) or Erasmus programme projects. In order for the EU to meet all the financial requirements in the most varied areas of economic and social activity, the EU budget must be increased by approximately EUR 8.3 billion and the European Commission has already presented a proposal to that effect. I think it is fundamental to respect the commitments entered into with the beneficiaries and to finance the projects which were approved by the European institutions.

      <p sl="fr">The Erasmus programme has proved its worth by enabling millions of young people to go and study in another country, improve their qualifications, learn a foreign language and discover another culture. The scheme contributes to European integration but also to the personal integration of young Europeans. Anything that came in its way would be a step backwards at a time when citizens are having their doubts about the EU and our young people are having doubts about the future. The programme is now a victim of the short-term vision of some Member States that, in the name of defending liberal dogma, are endangering one of the EU’s tools for investing in the future, that of training and that of youth. Discussions on the 2012 and 2013 budgets are well on the way to overcoming this deadlock, but this should not be disconnected from the negotiations under way on the financial framework for 2014-2020. The proposal of a freeze on the EU’s budget is unacceptable when we are promoting education and qualifications as the main assets in the fight against unemployment, particularly of young people.

The economy, for its part, regards experience abroad as an important qualification. Erasmus also makes a significant contribution in the context of the common, single market. It is one of the European Union’s most visible and most popular programmes and is already 99 % subscribed this year. Therefore it is necessary to provide additional resources for the programme. Students who start their Erasmus stays in the coming months need clarity as soon as possible. We should not be sowing confusion at this stage. Erasmus 2013 should not start with a budget deficit.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report is before us today because there is a significant delay being forecast with regard to reaching a conclusion on reform of the common fisheries policy. That is not surprising given that, with the Rodust report, MEPs have tabled some 2 600 amendments to the main regulation. My report was presented as something of a technicality, but there are some important messages to be carried forward from it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report was unanimously approved by the Committee on Fisheries, which is itself unusual. It relates to ensuring that the access regime out to 12 miles which is currently in place should be allowed to continue until such time as the new CFP has been agreed. If we did not approve this report, the 12-mile access regime would expire at the end of this year. I am glad to say that the committee unanimously agreed that this would be unacceptable and unthinkable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 12-mile zone has been a feature of the common fisheries policy since the initial regulation in 1983, and since then it has always been put into effect for a further ten-year period. This extension would continue until 2014, and then we will see what the new CFP brings.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I want to make the point that even the Commission has accepted that the management of fisheries within the 12-mile zone has on the whole been successful: ‘generally managed successfully’, in the Commission’s words. So drawing lessons from that, which effectively means that the fishing nations themselves have been relatively successful in managing fisheries out to 12 miles, compared with the general failure of the common fisheries policy as a whole, I think that there is strong case for extending the 12-mile limit both in time and in distance. But that is an argument for the Rodust report, which I look forward to receiving.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the committee and Parliament for allowing this report to go through so quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">15 000 people will die of hunger today. Just to put this into perspective, that is equivalent to all of Parliament and its staff, the Council and its staff, the Court of Justice and its staff, the Ombudsman and his staff and one third of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The global population is expected to double and go up to nine billion people, and our food production output has to double to meet that appalling number of people that the world will have to feed. The current Food Aid Convention falls short of what is required. The new Convention which we will pass today will introduce new forms of assistance: local producers with local purchases; untied food aid; vouchers for farmers in developing countries that they can turn into money and food and that help agriculture in developing countries. I would like to thank everyone for working so hard to get this report through and for trying to save so many lives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to make some short remarks, as we have had no preliminary discussion on this topic.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed directive is intended to replace the 1995 decision regarding consular protection for EU citizens by diplomatic and consular representations, in view of the legal framework established by the Lisbon Treaty. Article 23 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on which the proposal is based, provides that every citizen of the European Union shall, in the territory of third countries where the Member State of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic and consular authorities of any Member State. The proposal covers not only everyday situations, such as loss of a passport or becoming a victim of crime, but also crisis situations where EU citizens might need help. While in relation to everyday situations citizens could seek help at any consulate or embassy of any Member State, crisis situations are different. There was almost unanimous agreement in all the committees involved here that no single Member State or lead-state should bear the burden of dealing with evacuation or other crisis-related tasks, including assistance to unrepresented EU citizens, so the role of coordination had to be shifted to EU delegations. This proposal is an excellent illustration of the fact that ‘more Europe’ does not mean more bureaucracy or more Brussels. ‘More Europe’ could also mean more help for EU citizens in need, and more protection for citizens unrepresented in third countries who find themselves in precarious or crisis-related situations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts and to ask all of you, colleagues, to support this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very satisfied with the report by Ms Bastos, on which I voted in favour. Unfortunately, the severe economic crisis in Europe has had a negative impact on perceptions of the single market’s potential, among both citizens and businesses, and some governments and national political movements. There is a danger that this will cloud our vision of the excellent work done by the European institutions to revitalise and strengthen the single market, for example the wide-ranging public procurement reform and the revision of the Late Payments Directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree that there is a need, as Ms Bastos has stressed, to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation between the European Union and the Member States. Fundamental measures – such as the setting up of unitary patent protection – are all too often blocked or delayed by institutional conflict and national egotism. In a period of crisis like the current one, we need to take a united approach to governance, one which enables us to introduce the necessary legislation promptly, to revitalise the internal market and strengthen the rights of citizens within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I believe that in politics we should not be afraid of words. The single market, which is now 20 years old, has brought many things. The benefits are huge. Let us not mince our words, though: we need to say out loud that the single market will not be fully justified until it has become a means of protecting our jobs and industries. If we do not change our ways, we need to ask ourselves what is going to happen in the future. Dominant economies like China, Korea, Japan and Qatar are going to carry on buying up our industries and our jobs, and when Europe’s new bosses decide to relocate, there will be nothing we can do about it. That is why words are important in politics.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think we should agree that the time really has come to set up a proper protection policy for the internal market: European protectionism.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as a member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I have taken a close interest in the report by Ms Bastos on the 20 main concerns of citizens and businesses. Our debate on this report has also been linked to our debate on the 20th anniversary of the single market. For 20 years it has supposedly been possible to exercise the freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital in the single market, our area of living, trade and freedom.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I was interested in the fact that one of the leading concerns expressed by European citizens was the difficulty of having professional qualifications recognised, and on this we really need to be particularly proactive and effective. That is what our citizens are expecting of us: that we succeed in setting up, in the very near future, recognition procedures for their certificates, skills and professional qualifications that are genuinely more rapid, simpler, more effective and less costly. This is a real challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on this matter, the modernisation of these procedures, I am actively working with the other members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on a genuine response to this major challenge of mobility. More mobility for more of Europe: that is what our fellow citizens are asking for.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to relaunch the single market, which is a key element in realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, I think it is important to step up the strategies for reviving economic growth and employment, and winning the confidence of citizens and businesses. I support the report because it emphasises the gap between expectations and reality, which is often the cause of growing concern, for example about tax obstacles, energy costs, and payment of VAT.</p>
      <p sl="it">At a time when citizens are eyeing Europe with mistrust, we need to improve cooperation between the EU institutions and the Member States in order to promote competitiveness, creating new jobs and contributing to research and innovation, and to territorial cohesion, in order to protect our businesses and high quality products. For example we need to harmonise energy costs, which are the largest outgoings for many businesses, in order to create a single European market.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I voted in favour of the report. I am particularly pleased that the report encourages businesses to be bolder in hiring young people who have studied abroad, and to produce information and publicity in such a way that consumers who are more disadvantaged are also taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the case of information and publicity, the report also calls on the Commission to monitor and control the effectiveness and success of information campaigns. I sincerely support this proposal, since if the campaigns fail to reach the selected target groups or if consumers do not understand what we wish to say to them, then our work is pointless and we are wasting scarce resources.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am honoured that you have chosen to speak English today. I find that delightful.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are 20 concerns here about matters on which European legislation has focused, and they are important – about professional qualifications, opening bank accounts, having inheritance rights recognised, establishing rights to pensions and so on throughout the EU – but what is more important, in an EU where unemployment is growing very fast, is job creation. The engines of job creation in the single market are the small and medium-sized enterprises. They are in the vanguard when it comes to creating jobs and getting our economy moving, and the report has focused on that reality. That is why I supported it.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, 35 % of European citizens do not even know about the single market. They do not understand the legislative framework or our regulations. What we need is less regulation in order to enable the enterprising spirit of European people to garner its own reward through hard work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is a major achievement and is now, more than ever, a key element in realising the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Twenty years of the single market is a long time, but there is still a lot to do. So it is fundamentally important that this celebration is used as an opportunity to relaunch the single market, and it is also important for us to look ahead and see what we still lack. For example, a common energy policy is now essential if all of Europe’s citizens are to be guaranteed secure and clean energy supplies at more accessible prices.</p>
      <p sl="it">Removing obstacles and relaunching the single market will prove decisive in Europe’s current economic and social crisis, because they will contribute to innovation, growth, development, the promotion of competitiveness and above all to job creation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I support the agreement between Parliament and the Commission. The single market was formed to increase the flow of commerce between Member States, without barriers. Today, unfortunately, that is not the reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to assure our citizens that they benefit from EU membership and that they all belong to the same community. To make that a reality, we must further deepen the single market, thus increasing competition, economic growth and job creation, and making available more money to increase social benefits. We must accomplish this, but how do we do it?</p>
      <p sl="en">We must promote harmonisation; we must create a single rail system, for example; we must introduce standardised rules for small and medium businesses. We need less regulation and clearer regulation. Harmonisation is vital for the single market and for our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the objective of a single market is to have a free flow of goods, services and capital between Member States, which should lead to balanced economic growth. But citizens continue to run into problems with the proper functioning of this market, particularly because of a number of legal loopholes, and also because of inadequate information. Consequently I agree with the need to present the Commission and Member States with recommendations that will bring about standardisation of the functioning of the single market, as an improvement will only come about with Member States’ involvement.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a minimum, standardisation is needed in the recognition of occupational qualifications, or access to health and pension services, and also to banking services. Support is needed for a functional digital single market, to enable it to bring benefits to business people and consumers. I support the call to modernise national public administration to promote electronic facilities. I also take a positive view of the demand for closer cooperation between Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States in the direction of increasing the influence of citizens in EU internal affairs.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I was happy to give my support to this report, but I believe that the earlier we can put a single market in place, the better it will be for all of us, especially to escape from the economic recession and to create jobs and growth in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I find it somewhat bemusing to hear that this addresses the concerns of European citizens and businesses. It certainly addresses the concerns of businesses but, unfortunately, where most citizens are concerned, they are probably not even aware of the single market and what it means. That certainly is a challenge for us.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Having said that, the proposals are eminently sensible and certainly they are worth completing as soon as we can. I would just like to emphasise two of them. One is the vast potential that is there in the use of the internet and e-commerce. Too many businesses do not trade outside their own Member State, never mind the European Union: there is a challenge for us. The other is the recognition of qualifications across the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too voted in favour of this report because consolidating the single market is an essential factor for the relaunching of economic growth and employment for the labour force. For this reason, I consider that the existing obstacles, including with regard to freedom of movement within the single market, need to be removed as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">That way, citizens will be able to take full advantage of all their rights. Yet Romanian citizens still face restrictions, although the latter are not justified and should be eliminated. Against the background of the economic crisis, elimination of the gaps and barriers identified is becoming increasingly important. By that means, we will be able to contribute to innovation, growth, competitiveness and greater confidence in the single market. I would like to highlight the importance of better joint government, primarily with regard to improved cooperation. Furthermore, I consider that the economic and social wellbeing of the Union’s citizens must be central to this approach.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a very important report. Japan is our second largest trading partner after China, with the EU, and Japan has invested heavily in the European Union. Japan’s production of motor vehicles, both in the European Union and in my own country, the UK, is quite splendid. 140 000 jobs are being kept going – the number is in fact increasing – because of Japan’s investment in the EU economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Likewise, we ought to be investing in the Japanese economy. What we need to do is to ask the Japanese not to keep on with quantitative tariffs and quantitative restrictions, but to open up their distribution networks to our exports and our services. It is sometimes very difficult to distribute within Japan because of the way in which business is done there, and we need Japan to understand that we should also be able to have a level playing field so that we can access the Japanese market and Japanese consumers in the same way that we have permitted Japan to access our markets and to sell its goods to our people.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, taken together, the European Union and Japan represent more than one fifth of world trade. Many high-quality Japanese products have for years enjoyed the trust of a high proportion of Europeans. A mutual free trade agreement should make it significantly easier for our business people to obtain goods, and also expand exports to Japan. The mere fact that a distinct majority of them are in favour of commencement of negotiations bears this out. Such matters as duty, intellectual property law, business competitiveness and above all the removal of non-tariff barriers and obstacles to market access in public procurement must be sorted out. Attention must be drawn to the need to carry out an assessment of progress in eliminating non-tariff barriers after commencement of negotiations, which is not without significance for Parliament’s future stance. While avoiding an uncontrolled rise in imports, we must also envisage bilateral protective measures, especially in respect of such sectors as the automobile industry, so as not to cause any threat to European businesses. I support this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, amidst the current global financial crisis we must not forget that the European Union also has to hold its ground as the circumstances of global economic competition change. Some believe that the 21st century will be Asia’s century, not to mention China’s. Looking at the emerging markets, the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations – Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia – will be capable of generating incredible economic output. Under these circumstances we have to do everything we can to ensure that the EU continues to develop its trade links with the region, principally with the countries that already have functioning market economies. One such step is the forthcoming free trade agreement with Japan, which could provide a significant boost to trade based on experience of the similar agreement reached with South Korea, and thus be beneficial for both sides.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We know that dismantling the customs and duties standing in the way of free trade is not the most difficult task, unlike the abolition of non-customs barriers that are vital to achieving genuine free trade. Europe has to pay more attention than ever before to the countries in East Asia, as trade with this region still harbours many opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I too want to congratulate you on your excellent English; keep it up. I will try speaking the language of Dante one day, but not yet.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and Japan should be proud to cement their partnership in a free trade agreement (FTA). Japan is not only a key European ally and a liberal democracy, but also the third largest economy in the world, with highly advanced systems of production and levels of consumption. As mentioned by my colleague, trade with Japan is massive, generating over EUR 116 billion in combined imports and exports last year. Free trade is, after all, a cornerstone of what the EU is all about for the benefit of manufacturers and consumers alike. We must carry on developing and consolidating these markets, trading opportunities and strategic partnerships wherever we find them, and particularly those with democracies like India and Japan, which will enable us to kick-start economic growth, with this being what is missing on our continent at present.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the 21 years since the first EU-Japan joint declaration was made on trade and other issues, it is clear that political relations between the European Union and Japan have gone from strength to strength. This FTA can only serve to benefit both sides.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I also voted in favour of this agreement. Japan is the European Union’s second-largest trading partner, and this is important. Last year trade amounted to EUR 160 billion, and, as Europeans, we all know that Japan has a very strong presence in Europe, above all in our industrial markets.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is also very important that the access of European firms to Japan’s markets is likewise facilitated. It is important to remember at all times that in trade policy the principle of reciprocity is a good thing. Right now the opportunity exists for the abolition of unnecessary tariffs. Europe, too, needs growth and consequently this free trade can be of benefit to both parties.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Of course, as European decision-makers we must always remember that since the European Union is a community of values, it is also important to strengthen links with Japan, which despite its cultural differences and background shares the common European values of democracy, human rights, freedom of opinion and the rule of law, and it would be good to be mindful of these values when we engage in trade.</p>

In order to correctly and smoothly apply interim agreements, the Commission has indicated that the provisions of five regulations relating to implementing acts fundamentally conform to the provisions of the newest Commission proposal on the EC-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement. For this reason, potential amendments to the provisions of the above five regulations brought about by the Trade Omnibus I report should be mirrored in the amendments to the Commission proposal under examination.

This integration has already been consolidated on the basis of trade and industrial partnerships, and now further action is required to fit it into the institutional and regulatory system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Previous agreements have shown how significant and important progress can be promoted across a wide spectrum of fundamental areas, from the liberalisation of markets to encouraging foreign investment, from strengthening legality to the resulting rise in free enterprise, from the exchange of ideas and information to civil and economic liberties, from the modernisation of legal systems to the gradual alignment of laws with the European acquis .

The amendments introduced by the rapporteur aim at aligning the amended provisions to the changes brought about by ‘Trade Omnibus I’ to the Regulations concerning application of Stabilisation and Association Agreements and Interim Agreements. However, we must assess this report on its deeper significance, bearing in mind positions of principle concerning the Treaty and the provisions therein on trade policy. In principle the Treaty of Lisbon lays down that commercial policy is the exclusive competence of the EU. Commercial interests are clearly different from country to country, since the respective economies and their weaknesses and potential are different. Placing the interests of the strongest over those of the weakest in this field, as in other fields, is harmful to the weaker economies and that is happening with Portugal, which is subject to the commercial interests of the big companies of the EU powers, especially Germany, which are so often contrary to the interests of the national productive fabric.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In view of the agreements signed between the European Union and the Republic of Serbia with a view to boosting trade between the two economies and having regard to the amendments arising from implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is necessary to introduce amendments to the agreements signed. The legislative changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon are in addition to the changes introduced by ‘Trade Omnibus I’ and the resultant strategic alignment of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements between the EU and various Balkan countries. Therefore, the European Parliament must maintain legislative consistency as regards treatment of the Balkan countries, which include Serbia. In view of the above, I am voting in favour of the report which proposes to bring the agreements signed between the EU and Serbia into line with existing legislation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement (IA) between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part. The SAA and the Interim Agreement stipulate that certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Serbia may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management and review of these tariff quotas in order to allow for their thorough assessment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is appropriate that the advisory procedure be used for the adoption of immediate measures in case of exceptional and critical circumstances given the effects of these measures and their sequential logic in relation to the adoption of definitive measures. Where a delay in the imposition of measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair it is necessary to allow the Commission to adopt immediately applicable provisional measures. With the aim of the correct and smooth application of the IA, the Commission proposes an Implementing Regulation, to lay down rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of these Agreements.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this report because I believe in free trade. However, as the report concerns the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which includes as a general principle the observance of human rights, I feel I must comment on two recent incidents in Serbia which are of concern to me. Firstly, the recent behaviour by Serbian football fans at an England-Serbia under-21 match in Belgrade was despicable. The fans made monkey taunts at black England player Danny Rose, and stones, coins and chairs were thrown at the players. Secondly, Belgrade’s decision to ban a gay pride event for the second year running is worrying. Serbia should respect the right of LGBT people to free assembly. Commenting on the banning of the gay pride event, the Serbian Prime Minister said that ‘Nobody will be telling anyone what should happen in Belgrade’. In principle I agree, as I am opposed to EU meddling in issues which should be decided at Member State level. However, if Serbia is serious about accession to the European Union it must ensure that fundamental rights are respected, and that means tackling all forms of discrimination, especially racism and homophobia.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The amendments introduced by the rapporteur aim at aligning the amended provisions to the changes brought about by ‘Trade Omnibus I’ to the Regulations concerning application of Stabilisation and Association Agreements and Interim Agreements. It is important, however, to make one criticism, since the Treaty of Lisbon lays down that commercial policy is the exclusive competence of the EU. It is clear that there will be different commercial policies adapted to the interests of each country, and history shows that placing the interests of the stronger countries above the interests of the weaker countries, in this field as in other fields, is harmful to the weaker economies, which is what has happened and is happening with Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am in favour of this report, since I agree with the rapporteur’s proposal, given its urgency and importance for the continuation of the seed importation regime. However, I agree with the rapporteur’s position in underlining that the Commission proposal has failed to amend the ‘old’ comitology provisions of Decision 2003/17/EC, which in fact only concerned the amendment of both its annexes. It is well known that old comitology provisions, given the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, have to be replaced by either delegated or implementing acts in accordance with Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. However, the Commission confirms that the annexes to Decision 2003/17/EC are not expected to be amended before the entry into force of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform’s legislative proposal on seed. For that reason, and to avoid any possible obstacles to the prompt adoption of this urgent proposal, the rapporteur considers that it should be enough to delete the current comitology provisions of the amended Decision 2003/17/EC (i.e. its Articles 4 and 5). The rapporteur therefore proposes three amendments; nevertheless, if an amendment to those annexes proves necessary, this will still be possible by means of the ordinary legislative procedure and, consequently, I am voting in favour of this report.</p>

Even though we supported the rapporteur’s proposal, I should like to take this opportunity to draw attention once more to the constraints associated with the world seed market, which is increasingly controlled by a handful of large monopolies, which make millions of producers throughout the world dependent upon them.

It appears that those field inspections continue to afford the same guarantees as those carried out by the Member States. These field inspections should therefore continue to be considered as equivalent.

We must also consider industries related to the fisheries sector, which employ several hundred thousand people.

      <p sl="fr">The common fisheries policy (CFP) has not succeeded in protecting fisheries resources and the balance of the ecosystem any more than it has managed to prevent economic and social damage to a particularly important sector of activity. Management of coastal areas by their Member States is one of its rare successes. That is why the extension of this zone in space and time is a step in the right direction for the complete overhaul of the CFP. The future CFP must propose local solutions within the framework of partnerships with the Member States and the large coastal regions. It must also give a larger role to producers and improve consumer protection. Finally, the new CFP must not simply take a free trade approach. In international negotiations, fisheries products should be treated as ‘sensitive products’ just like certain agricultural products.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted together with my group for the extension of national fisheries management within the 12-mile zones of each Member State. This is one of the very few aspects of the common fisheries policy which have in fact proved to be a resounding success. Why? Because it leaves Member States with the power to manage their own waters. It is no secret that the management of the fisheries resources beyond the 12-mile limit, a regulation under the purview of the European Union, has been a resounding failure. This is why I believe we must substantially increase the 12-mile limit for the period beyond 2014 (to 20 miles or beyond) and capitalise on the lessons we have learnt here in the overhaul of the common fisheries policy. Since the management of fisheries controlled by Brussels has always been over-regulated, highly centralised and utterly ineffective across the board, it is only sensible that we work towards a decentralised and regionalised system for the entire fisheries policy. The coastal regime stands as a brilliant example of how we must restructure other policies where powers have been grabbed by Brussels and Member States have been sidelined.</p>

I urge the adoption of the report in its current form, and I support the extension of the zone to 20 miles from the coast.

      <p sl="pt">The fisheries sector is fundamental to the European Union, not only as regards food but also as regards the environment. Thus the sustainable management of fisheries resources is one of the EU’s concerns, above all as regards endangered species. The European Parliament, aware of the importance of this sector, has often debated this matter. In 2009 it adopted a resolution (206), on the need to conserve fisheries resources in the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. Everyone acknowledges that the common fisheries policy has in general been a failure. Whereas fisheries management within the 12-mile zones (which is the responsibility of the Member States) has been a success, management outside these zones (the responsibility of Brussels) has been a disaster. I voted in favour of this report because I agree with the rapporteur on the two aspects mentioned in his conclusion: as regards urgency, since the current 12-mile zones, although they work well, will expire on 31 December, it is necessary to extend them for two more years; and as regards inclusion of this debate within a broader scope – that is, within the process of reform of the European Union’s common fisheries policy.</p>

Within the framework of existing legislation, Article 17(2) of the current Regulation establishes a derogation from the equal access principle within 12 nautical miles of each Member State. The derogation is in place from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2012. Since it is highly unlikely that reform of the common fisheries policy will be completed before the end of 2012, it has been necessary for the Commission to bring forward the current proposal to ensure that the existing regime – which the Commission itself has assessed as very positive – does not lapse. We voted in favour of the report. However, we think that the principle of exclusive access should be of a permanent nature and that the area should be extended beyond 12 miles (with the proviso that, in the case of the outermost regions, that area should include the whole of the Exclusive Economic Zone, that is, should be increased from 100 to 200 miles). The rapporteur also thought this, which is why we support his position.

Rules in place restricting access to resources within that zone have benefited conservation by restricting fishing effort in the most sensitive part of Union waters.

      <p sl="en">The current 12-mile zone was put into place in the first CFP Regulation in 1983. Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 170/83 established that the zone would be in place from 1 January 1983 until 31 December 1992; equivalent provisions were enacted in the subsequent CFP reforms (Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 and Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002). The current basic regulation (Council Regulation 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy) will remain in force until a new regulation has been adopted, except for a provision in its Article 17(2) on access rules and restrictions for the 12 nautical miles waters which expires on 31 December 2012. Taking into account that a new basic regulation will not be adopted before that date, the provisions of this article will no longer apply. The necessity to avoid that gave the green light to the report. But why is this at the last moment? What was the European Commission doing earlier?</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the report and support these measures for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, which are scientifically grounded and truly necessary. Such measures are necessary in the Black Sea, which over the past 30 years has undergone continuous deterioration in the quality of its coastal waters and pressure from exploitation. As a result, live marine resources have suffered a dramatic decline which in some cases has led to the exhaustion of the stocks of exploitable organisms. While the annual catch exceeded 15 000 tonnes of fish in the mid-1980s, in 2008 it was barely 500 tonnes. Currently, only 5 of the 26 species of fish with commercial value are still being exploited in the Black Sea. Many species of sturgeon are endangered, as are dolphins, sharks and seahorses. Seals, many species of shrimp and seashells, and tens of species of plants and organisms have already disappeared from the Black Sea. I therefore support the conservation of fisheries resources as mentioned in this report.</p>

If we opted to make the common agricultural policy greener with new environmental conditions, why should the same requirements not apply to the fishing industry, when we know that the ocean biomass is in a critical state? The text of the fisheries reform proposed several months ago by the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Ms Damanaki, sought ‘to promote sustainable and competitive fisheries and aquaculture’. However, it has to be said that the proposals of certain political groups and Member States seem a long way from the spirit of the reform.

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour. That the CFP has generally been a failure over the last 30 years is a universally acknowledged fact. The Commission's comment in its Green Paper on CFP reform (COM(2009)0163) that "the current CFP has not worked well" is perhaps something of an understatement and the ongoing reform process has been brought about by necessity. In contrast, there is widespread acknowledgement that fisheries management within the 12-mile zones has been a success. The Green Paper for example stated that the coastal regime "has generally worked well and could even be stepped up", whilst the report on reporting obligations under Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 (COM(2011)0418) stated that "the regime is very stable, and the rules have continued to operate satisfactorily". As the debate around the wider CFP reform continues, one of the key issues to be decided upon is the level and nature of decentralisation and regionalisation to be brought into effect. The general effectiveness of Member State control within the 12-mile zones clearly demonstrates that management appropriate to local circumstances is most effective. The success of Member State control contrasts sharply with the failure of EU-centred control - and offers a useful guide for the direction in which CFP reform should be heading.</p>

Given that the management of fisheries resources beyond the 12-mile limits, which has remained in the hands of Brussels, has been ineffective, I would be very much in favour of a decentralised regime.

The report voted on in plenary only had the effect of extending the time limit of the regime until 31 December 2014, after which it was expected to be brought into line with the CFP reform currently under way by means of a new regulation. The vote was unanimous because certain questions raised by the committee were not addressed, such as the proposal to extend the derogation in coastal zones beyond the current limit. In order to avoid any further extension, the rapporteur also proposed that the regime should be extended indefinitely.

Concerning the specifics of the Agreement, it should be emphasised that a good third of imports from Moldova are agricultural products and foodstuffs. This is why we have a direct interest in supporting cooperation agreements and legislative convergence processes that promote a culture of quality and excellence in this sector, which, like fashion, is one of the sectors most vulnerable to fraud. Consideration must be given to the positive effects of protecting geographical indications (PGI) in terms of protecting farmland from speculation, a problem that urgently needs to be addressed in view of the recurrent tensions in the commodities market.

      <p sl="ro">The geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs began to be protected in the European Union in order to prevent abuse, imitation of products and false indications of origin, thereby ensuring better quality in the products offered to consumers. The purpose of registering names is to help producers earn higher incomes through the added value brought by this identification. From 1992 onwards, a system for the registration of those intellectual property rights which are also protected at international level was introduced at European level, though in a less effective way. The Union applies the same standards for the mutual protection of geographical indications in its dealings with third countries. This is also the case with the agreement with Moldova, through which bilateral trade conditions will be improved. It must be pointed out that for products from third countries, there is an additional requirement over and above those for EU products, namely that names must be protected in the country of origin at the time when the application for EU protection is made. This agreement with the EU gives the Republic of Moldova the opportunity to extend and protect its current geographical indications across the Union, with a view to the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement in the Framework of an Association Agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">As is known, geographical indication is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (e.g. a town, region, or country).

A report was approved just this week on trade relations with the United States, in which an explicit reference was finally made to the protection of our origin and quality marks.

      <p sl="pl">Geographical indications of agricultural products in the European Union are one of the symbols of an EU presence on European tables. The regional agricultural products protection system in the European Union is good at implementing the objective, which is to protect the names of these products and guarantee their authenticity. Both producers and consumers of foodstuffs have recorded their satisfaction with the functioning of this system many times over. Consequently we have reason to recognise an extension of its geographical scope to include states aspiring to EU membership as sound. One such state is Moldova.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For some years now, Moldova has been making progress along the road to EU membership that has been seen as positive. Moldova is definitely the Eastern Partnership state that is taking fullest advantage of its political opportunity. The European Union should make efforts to draw Moldova closer to European institutions, together with an imminent prospect of concluding a deeper and more comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU as part of an association agreement.

The publication of the Parties’ minimum annual commitments, the Committee’s annual report and the dates, locations and summary records of the Committee’s sessions will facilitate greater external accountability and allow stakeholders to track donor performance.

The broadening of the list of Eligible Activities is in response to the adoption of a food assistance approach more suited to the times, to the donors’ potential and to the needs of the beneficiaries. The Food Assistance Committee could promote coordination policies, partly to reinforce the necessary conditions for adopting assistance plans in line with the general principles that underpin the EU’s cooperation and development policies such as respect for human and civil rights, a minimum framework of administration and government, essential levels of transparency, periodic checks of the results and the uses made of the aid. The whole system needs to evolve, from the original idea of using up agricultural surpluses into an effective culture of support and development of agricultural production in the beneficiary countries. Finally, I concur with the wish concerning the donors’ expression of their commitments solely in terms of value, because it is quite clear that being able to express them in terms of quantity is simply a legacy of a time when the global agricultural products market was less volatile.</p>

The Food Assistance Convention 2012 aims to improve food assistance policy, to which end the following will be necessary: moving from a product-based approach to a more varied, needs-based and locally adapted mix of tools; finding longer term solutions with activities that facilitate the transition from relief to rehabilitation or recovery programmes; donor coordination; and mutual learning around food assistance policy and practice. Accordingly, the European Union will need to put in place the most effective and efficient food assistance policy that responds to the food and nutrition needs of the most vulnerable populations, based on objectively identified needs. In addition, at the European level, a mechanism allowing for the maximum involvement of representatives of countries affected by emergencies needs to be developed as a means of increasing the legitimacy of the Food Assistance Convention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Given the still unresolved problem of hunger, with which 13.6 % of humankind is grappling, and the terrible consequences this problem creates, mainly among women and children in developing countries, I am supporting the new 2012 Food Assistance Convention. Thanks to the fact that this Convention differs from its predecessor at several crucial points, the battle against world hunger may become more effective. In my view, the main flow of assistance should be directed towards programmes supporting rebuilding and renewal which help to reinforce local production, and thus make a gradual move away from ad hoc assistance possible. Through this approach we can reduce the dependency of hungry countries on long-term aid. We should, however, continue to work to improve certain aspects of the Convention, including striving to create a system whereby the Convention’s obligations are expressed in value terms, meaning avoidance of, for example, delays in delivering food caused by rises in global food prices. This problem arises from freedom in the expression of one’s minimum annual obligations relating to food assistance. It is also important to increase the share of food assistance in grant form, and to improve farming yields in countries affected by hunger.</p>

      <p sl="it">I approve of and support the Food Assistance Convention (FAC), which is adopting new criteria compared with the previous FAC. It introduces a criterion of encouragement towards non-dependency on aid instead of the kind of long-term dependency that prevents growth and development. Furthermore, the criteria introduced, which aim to increase transparency and openness towards new products and the terms of the Convention, make this a very positive revision of the FAC. As pointed out by the rapporteur, there are still some areas for improvement but the steps taken towards better regulation of distribution and access to aid will undoubtedly improve the effectiveness of this Convention. The introduction of agricultural products and foodstuffs that aim not to meet food needs but to protect livelihoods in emergency and early recovery situations, such as seeds and livestock for milk and meat should be highlighted.</p>

As regards the general principles of food aid, I only support its provision when it is the most effective and efficient means of addressing the food and nutrition needs of the most vulnerable groups in society. I expect that countries will take on the commitment to ensure their food security and that they will create the conditions for reducing poverty and eradicating hunger. We must work for a Europe which is not only characterised by having a unity of interests, but also has an appropriate social security system, and most importantly one where citizens – if they are dependent on food aid – are not in a situation where they have to live on charity, which may be demeaning to them.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for the resolution on consular protection for citizens of the Union abroad. The proposed directive is intended to replace the 1995 decision on consular protection for EU citizens by diplomatic and consular representations. Article 23 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic and consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that State. This principle has also been established in Article 46 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The proposed directive covers not only everyday situations such as the loss of identity documents, arrest or imprisonment, but also covers situations where EU citizens might need assistance. I agree with the opinion that in cases of crisis situation, Union delegations should be in charge of coordinating and providing assistance regarding the preparation for and in case of crisis. In order not to put an unbearably heavy burden on the Lead State, or any Member State present in the area, it should be the Union delegation who deals with all the coordination of cooperation. In emergency situations it should also be responsible for coordinating the actions and plans and evacuation arrangements of the missions of the Member States. I agree with the speaker that this proposal is an excellent illustration of the fact that ‘more Europe’ does not mean more bureaucracy or more Brussels. ‘More Europe’ could also mean more help for EU citizens in need, and more protection for citizens who are not represented in third countries and who find themselves in precarious or crisis situations.</p>

To ensure that this right is not an illusory one, and that citizens may enjoy the practical benefits of citizenship of the Union, clarification of the contents and means of exercising this right effectively and simplified cooperation and coordination between consular and diplomatic authorities have become necessary at EU level. For that reason, I welcome the Commission’s motion and Ms Bauer’s report, which will remove the obstacles that exist when we seek the diplomatic or consular assistance to which citizens are entitled when they need protection, in cases where they are outside their country of origin.

As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am more than satisfied with the work done on this report. I believe that the measures adopted will improve the enforcement of this right, through better coordination between Member States on consular representation. The only doubt that remains is how these new measures will be publicised among European citizens. I think that a coordinated campaign of information at European level could be the most effective way of achieving the results we hope for.</p>

The large-scale crises of recent years, following the uprisings in Libya and Egypt and the earthquake in Japan, have affected about 150 000 EU citizens and highlighted the importance of consular protection in third countries. It is important that every citizen of the EU is, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented, entitled to protection by the diplomatic and consular authorities of any Member State. I agree with the proposals for the development of a clear Member State cooperation and support coordination system as well as for the establishment of common consular protection terms. I agree that the Member States should consider establishing a trust fund for consular protection, from which the embassy or consulate of the assisting Member State could advance its expenses for assisting an unrepresented citizen and into which the Member States of the assisted unrepresented citizen should reimburse the financial advance.</p>

The Member States should consider establishing a trust fund for consular protection, from which the embassy or consulate of the assisting Member State could advance its expenses for assisting an unrepresented citizen and into which the Member States of the assisted unrepresented citizen should reimburse the financial advance.

      <p sl="it">In a recent article the historian Niall Ferguson argued that the current European system of governance is a bit like the United States of America facing the 21st century with its old Articles of Confederation as its institutional instrument. I should point out that these Articles survived for barely eight years before succumbing to constitutional revisions imposed by political and practical imperatives. My point is that the European institutions should make an effort to bridge the gap between relatively advanced European integration and the manner in which this integration is applied, which in a wide variety of spheres, is slowly and imperfectly. This report, on which I voted in favour, deals with one of these contradictions in the field of the diplomatic representation of European citizens, the particular importance of which becomes apparent if we draw up, even for just one year, a list of the emergency situations that have required the intervention of the consular authorities of individual Member States. The various rights and interests of our citizens can be threatened by unforeseeable crises at any time, even in remote areas. I therefore feel that the measures in the report (including the creation of a trust fund) are appropriate because the integration of consular protection, which is already practised in some areas of the world on an informal basis, would allow the interests of Europeans to be defended more effectively and would give greater substance to the notion of European citizenship.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Adoption of the draft directive on consular protection and its subsequent implementation could be a sign of the continued existence of solidarity between EU countries that can be mobilised. This directive strengthens the protection of our citizens in situations where they feel most vulnerable. Belonging to the European Union gives them that extra chance at the most difficult of times. This is because the directive now approved means Member States which are represented in a given region, regardless of where that might be in the world, are obliged to give any EU citizens without foreign representation the same assistance as they give their own citizens, in the event of lost documents, arrest, accident or illness. This assistance must also be provided in cases where it is extremely difficult for citizens to reach their own consular representation (where travel would take more than one day). I think this represents significant progress in protecting the interests of Hungarian citizens in situations where they are most in need of help anywhere in the world outside the European Union if, because of an accident, attack, natural disaster or even the loss of documents, they find themselves isolated and unable to travel home. We also have an interest in the part of the directive that increases the role of the European External Action Service and EU foreign representation along with the coordination of consular protection, thinking here of the case of Előd Tóásó, who is currently languishing in prison in Bolivia. This is an important gesture from Parliament, the Council and the Commission to its own citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Every year, EU citizens travel outside the EU more than 90 million times, but only in the United States, China and Russia do all 27 EU Member States have a diplomatic presence. These figures emphasise the importance of providing consular protection to EU citizens. I believe the report adopted today represents further progress in this respect as it facilitates access to consular protection for citizens whose Member States do not have a consular office in a particular country outside the EU. In the spirit of ‘more Europe’ I welcome the fact we are including the European External Action Service and EU foreign representations in the performance of consular duties, and so they will be responsible, in emergencies too, for coordinating cooperation between Member States and for evacuations. This will eliminate the somewhat unfair situation to date of one Member State taking on the entire burden of coordinating events in such cases. The proposal also simplifies access to financial assistance in crisis situations, and makes it easier for the country helping out to have costs reimbursed. This document is therefore based on European values and solidarity between European nations, and I believe it is an important step towards European citizenship, which is why I voted in favour of the report.</p>

This proposal is an excellent way of showing that more Europe does not necessarily mean more bureaucracy or more Brussels. Any EU citizen in difficulty abroad, for example after being involved in an accident, or being the victim of violence or theft, or being caught up in a crisis situation, should be able to seek assistance from the embassy or consulate of any EU Member State or, if necessary, the EU delegation, if his or her own country is unrepresented.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the case of loss of identity documents, arrest, detention and other problems that may descend upon us while we are travelling outside the EU, consular support is essential. According to the provisions of the Treaty, EU citizens have the right to take advantage of diplomatic and consular protection from any other Member State in a third country where the Member State of which these persons are nationals does not have its own representation. This right is an important aspect of EU citizenship and, as it were, expands the scope of consular protection for Europeans throughout the world. It is increasingly common, however, for citizens to need assistance not only with routine problems, such as those concerning documents, but also in crises which constitute a major coordination challenge. It is therefore important to nominate a single unit responsible for coordination, which would, for example, ensure that all EU citizens, including those not represented, were covered by emergency and evacuation plans. The question of the funding of such protection is also of great significance in this context. It is therefore important that the report gives attention to this. The report has my full support, as it will lead to an increase in consular protection for EU citizens and the provision of more effective and more prompt assistance in third countries.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this proposal as I firmly believe that new legislation is needed in order to ensure that EU citizens are able to exercise their rights, including rights in third countries. The right of citizens of unrepresented Member States to ask for assistance from Member States that do have consulates established is one of the rights of Union’s citizens. However, as experience has shown, citizens cannot comprehensively use their consular protection rights. One of the main problems is that citizens are not aware that they can get assistance from other Member States’ consulates while in third countries where their own Member State is not represented. This new directive will solve this problem. Furthermore, this directive will provide a common framework for assistance for citizens of unrepresented Member States. This directive will help to establish a system where Member States can agree that in certain countries or regions, one Member State acts as Lead State and coordinates consular work. This will not affect the ability of unrepresented citizens to seek assistance in establishments of any Member State. Such agreements will be publicised. That is, citizens who travel to a certain region will know which consulate they should contact first. In the long term, this will help to save funds as the presence of an agreed Lead State in the region will reduce the need for separate representations in that region for other Member States.</p>

It is therefore important to define the accessibility of an embassy or consulate in terms of the ability to reach it and return to the place of departure the same day; furthermore, in crisis situations the Union delegation should be in charge of coordinating and providing assistance regarding preparation for the crisis. In order to facilitate the access of EU citizens to their rights, I voted in favour of the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Recently there has been much discussion of the fact that people are not aware of their rights as EU citizens. This has led to many questioning the benefits which the EU offers to them as individuals. I voted in favour of this report, since it enhances the implementation of the rights of EU citizens in practical terms. Obtaining consular protection in a country where their own home country has no representation forms one of the most important rights of an EU citizen. In my opinion, in crisis situations EU missions should have a more important role in the coordination of relief work. In addition, where necessary they should also be able to provide other consular duties. A stronger role for EU delegations could also contribute positively towards a European identity.</p>

      <p sl="it">The consular and diplomatic services of all Member States should protect all European citizens seeking help abroad, affording them the same protection as they would give to a fellow national. Any European citizen in difficulties abroad, for example after an accident, a rape or a robbery, or having been arrested in a crisis situation, can freely seek assistance from an embassy or consulate of any other EU Member State or, if necessary, from the Union delegation, where their country is unrepresented. The Union delegations in non-EU countries (managed by the European External Action Service) should coordinate the Member States to ensure that citizens who are unrepresented by their own country can receive full assistance during an emergency. Many EU citizens were caught up in crises last year, for example in Libya, Egypt and Bahrain, during the democratic uprisings in the spring of 2011, and in Japan after the earthquake in March 2011. Consular protection is often essential even in day-to-day situations, for example where people fall seriously ill or are the victims of crime. ‘More Europe’ could mean more help for EU citizens in need.</p>

      <p sl="it">The right of a citizen of an unrepresented Member State to seek assistance from the consular authorities of other Member States who are represented is one of the rights conferred by EU citizenship. All EU citizens living or travelling in a third country in which the Member State of which they are nationals is not represented are entitled to protection from the diplomatic or consular authorities of another Member State under the same conditions as its nationals. In emergency or crisis situations – and I am thinking here of Japan, Libya and Egypt – EU citizens abroad are entitled to seek assistance from the consulate or embassy of other EU Member States if their own Member State is not represented, and Member States are obliged, when evacuating a country, to help all EU citizens as they do their own. According to the Lisbon Treaty, solidarity between Member States shall be supported, therefore, in everyday cases of consular protection, such as in cases of lost identity documents, arrest, detention or death, unrepresented citizens have the right to request the help of any diplomatic or consular authority of any Member State.

I view in a very positive light the proposal to leave to the Union delegation the role of coordination and assistance in crisis situations in which EU citizens in a third country are caught up. Attributing a leading coordination role to the Union delegation could facilitate consular protection and strengthen the role of the extensive network of EU delegations when it comes to consular protection.

      <p sl="en">The basis of this notion has actually featured in EU law since the Maastricht Treaty 20 years ago, and in many cases it is extremely useful for EU citizens to be able to make emergency use of other states' consular provisions abroad. The EU is nothing if not a solid alliance of nations united in friendship, and when an individual who is far away from home falls into difficulty or needs urgent help, occasional access to the services of a different state is an enormous benefit. But compromise is key: while smaller states should be allowed to opt in to consular protection organised at EU level, those states with larger resources should not be forced into giving way to the EEAS controlling consular matters. The UK is proud of its network of bilateral consular arrangements, and will firmly resist any pressure to abandon them.</p>

I should like to stress that in crisis situations the EU delegation is responsible for coordinating provision of assistance, so that no specific Member State is overburdened.

In the cases of the revolution in Libya and the earthquake in Japan, large numbers of EU citizens could not access consular protection despite the emergency situation; this proposal will put an end to such a scenario and should ensure a faster and more effective response by allowing us to pool resources.

      <p sl="pl">Most EU countries do not have, and never will have, their own embassies and consulates in all countries of the world. Meanwhile, citizens of these countries visit every corner of the globe for tourism or work purposes. Sometimes accidents happen which require the provision of consular assistance and protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposed directive envisages such protection being extended not only to EU citizens, but also to members of their families from third countries. This is of particular importance, as it constitutes the implementation of one of the fundamental principles defined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibiting discriminatory treatment. The draft legislative enactment also includes a rule on respect for the right of citizens to free decision, which should be reflected in the honouring of the will of each citizen, for example as regards non-notification of nearest and dearest of an event that has occurred or taking into account the wishes of the family on how to proceed with the body of a deceased citizen.</p>

Clearly we agree as regards this mechanism which makes it possible for EU citizens to receive assistance. However, what the rapporteur is proposing is an amendment in the direction of centralisation of that assistance in the EU institutions, proposing the substitution of Member State coordination of contingency plans in crisis situations by the Union delegations and by the European External Action Service: ‘The Union delegation shall coordinate the exchange of information about available evacuation capacities in a timely manner, coordinate the evacuation itself and provide the necessary assistance for evacuation, with possible support from existing intervention teams at Union level.’ We do not agree with this transfer of competence replacing the coordination processes between sovereign states with ‘federalisation’ and we fear that intervention by the EEAS will constitute yet another possibility for political interference in the countries in question. On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that Portuguese consular services and embassies do not close as a result of the setting up of these assistance services.</p>

I do not agree with those who warn that such assistance will be costly. The draft of this directive does not talk about encumbering anyone with additional tasks and outlay; what it says is that both EU citizens and Member States are to be provided with assurance and a legal framework for how to proceed. It is also worth stressing that greater coordination and a more effective division of tasks between Member States’ consulates will de facto lead to a reduction in costs. I am pleased that my opinion has found favour with the rapporteur and the numerous comments from the Committee on Legal Affairs have been considered in a positive light and incorporated into the final version of the report.

A fully functioning single market is an essential condition for successful implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and the main EU tool for stimulating the economic recovery and future growth of the Member States. Many barriers still remain owing to inappropriate or untimely implementation of legal acts in the Member States. There is also a lack of political will, especially in the Council, to reach agreements on significant measures such as the approval of e-signatures, clear intellectual property protection and copyright and redress, which results in EU citizens and companies looking upon the single market with distrust.

It is sad to see that European businesses and citizens continue to be obstructed in exercising their rights under the single market. There is still a gap between expectations and reality with regard to the single market, and this gap arises from shortcomings such as the lack of information and/or assistance for citizens in exercising their rights, and legislative vacuums in certain areas that businesses encounter during their activity.

I particularly want to emphasise the urgency of certain initiatives, given the obstacles encountered by our fellow citizens, especially small businesses, families and the elderly, when it comes to benefiting from their rights and opportunities in relation to competitiveness (training and human capital, access to public contracts in other Member States, energy supplies), and taxpayers’ rights (double taxation of pay and pensions, pension portability, European health services). The current obstacles to the single market (including in company law, the interoperability of technological, transport and training networks) hinder competitiveness and obstruct competition, to the benefit of structures, plans and mentalities characteristic of pre-Maastricht economies, with measurable negative effects on citizens.

      <p sl="cs">Twenty years after the introduction of the single market, the European Commission has proposed 12 further levers under the Single Market Act II, which mainly focus on the digital economy and crossborder mobility in the European Union. The European Parliament report, which I supported, emphasises support for employees who make use of the opportunity to work abroad. Citizens do not yet have sufficient information on the socio-legal conditions, so I believe that the European Union and each affected Member State should focus on providing employees with better information on their rights and obligations in those countries in which they work. In addition, Member States should improve language learning at an early age and adopt a uniform system for the recognition of formal and non-formal education, including lifelong learning. These options will improve the mobility of citizens between Member States, which will contribute to the quality of the single market and its development and growth. These are the reasons why I supported the report.</p>

Just as a British person would have to jump through a lot of hoops before becoming resident in America, it is not unthinkable that new residents of any new country of domicile would also be seemingly burdened with the necessary checks and registration procedures for example that create watertight systems.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At this time when we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the single market, it is regrettable that there are still so many barriers preventing European citizens from fully enjoying its benefits. The effects of the economic and financial crisis that has been ravaging the EU have contributed significantly to increasing the economic and social disparities between the Member States and the regions, with serious ramifications for the single market, as well as helping increase distrust amongst our citizens and businesses towards it. Nonetheless, it is worth recalling that the single market has been the backbone of the European economy and still is the basic pre-condition for us to be able to master the challenge of competitiveness and growth. We must look at what still needs to be done and what has not worked, putting things right and moving forward in a proactive and dynamic spirit, and thus addressing our citizens’ expectations. I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur Regina Bastos on the excellent work she has done in identifying the major concerns of citizens and business, and I agree with the guidelines she has put forward. I would like to call on the Council in particular to commit itself to an agreement on the package of measures contained in the Single Market Act I, so that they can be implemented as quickly as possible.</p>

When problems occur within the Union, the ‘prophets of doom’, otherwise known as ‘Eurosceptics’, jump at the opportunity to belittle the image of the European institutions and turn a blind eye to all the benefits of this project. We are all aware that the single market, one of the main pillars of the European project alongside the free movement of people and goods, has not been exploited to its full potential. It is therefore necessary to solve the issues preventing it from being used optimally, such as the problem of recognising professional qualifications in a straightforward, efficient and non-cumbersome way, or other barriers such as social security, tax, access to finance, online shopping, pensions, etc. This is the only way we will have more mobility so we can have more Europe. In the current context of economic and financial crisis, the single market is fundamental to overcoming this situation, which is why I voted in favour of this report and I hope that everyone can join forces so that the main concerns of citizens and business can be rapidly addressed.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Coming on the 20th anniversary of the single market, this report criticises the barriers hampering the smooth functioning of the single market, referring to the need to eliminate these barriers and highlighting the fact that the Member States need to bring forward, develop and improve the application of legislation on the single market. It is another example of the habitual propaganda that always goes hand in hand with emotional statements on the single market. The report maintains that the single market is a driver for the mobility of qualified labour that ‘can contribute to making Europe more competitive’. This will surely force a general devaluation of the workforce by a levelling down of working conditions – this is the type of mobility advocated. Moreover, it also advocates the completion of the internal energy market and a competitive digital single market, the liberalisation of public procurement and the rail sector, implementation of the cross-border healthcare directive, and coordinating education systems with the needs of the labour market. In other words, more progress in the market for public services and, in general, in all areas of life where the process of capitalist accumulation can be carried on, even if this means jeopardising rights such as education, health, water and sanitation, and social security, to name but a few. Needless to say, we voted against.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In the words of the Commission, there is still a gap between expectations and reality regarding the single market. This gap arises from interconnected shortcomings, which include the following: lack of information – frequently people do not know or do not sufficiently understand their rights; application gaps – in many areas there is a gulf between the EU legal framework and the way in which legislation is applied; legislative vacuum – in certain areas the EU legal framework does not meet the expectations of citizens and businesses. Under these circumstances, I firmly believe that it is desirable for all institutions involved to endeavour to make appropriate efforts to strengthen mutual cooperation on the issue of the functioning of the single market, particularly for the benefit of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Union is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis since it was established. Regrettably, we have to say that in certain cases this crisis threatens the very foundations of the European economy. I would like to emphasise, however, that the single market is still the best tool we have available to revive economic growth in Member State economies, and therefore it is extremely important that we treat each and every issue associated with the single market as a priority. I welcome the efforts of the European Commission in this area so far, but I feel that more commitment is needed in future to implementing European legislation. I am delighted that many mechanisms have been developed in recent years to help the single market grow, and to measure the contributions of individual Member States towards achieving this objective. The Internal Market Scoreboard is one such mechanism, which encourages Member States to improve the quality and speed of transposing internal market directives. The question is, then, what further action is required. I personally vote for more decisive, yet realistic, transposition and implementation deadlines. Therefore we must strive to achieve the lowest transposition deficit, the shortest transposition delays and the highest quality of transposition. The report by Ms Bastos highlights the concerns of our citizens and enterprises; now it is our responsibility to react to this and remedy the problems as soon as possible. I voted in favour of the report.</p>

Whether those crossing the borders are students, employees or employers, on many issues Europe is the solution for them, not the problem many are presenting it as today. A single market will never convince citizens if we do not attempt to establish a coherent economic, fiscal and social policy. Most countries are pursuing a short-sighted national or even regional policy in this area. We are constantly weakening the single market with 87 different rules where a single rule would be appropriate, by huge differences – for instance, tax havens like Luxembourg – which completely distort the economic and social structure of the surrounding regions.

This year’s 20th anniversary of the single market is an excellent opportunity to reflect on how best to inform citizens of these benefits and what else we need to do to free up the full potential of the internal market, in particular to support economic growth or create jobs. I am pleased that the report emphasises the need for Europeans to be better informed about the internal market. Defining the problems that citizens and businesses encounter in the single market is certainly an important step along the road towards creating a fully functioning single market. I supported the report because I consider that specifying these obstacles and the fears of Europeans is the key to adopting suitable provisions that will be an effective response to those problems which have been identified. Obviously simply creating a right is not good enough, as there is also a need for that right to be implemented by Member States. It is only then that it will be able to be effective and bring citizens measurable benefits. I am also pleased to see that the report calls for future monitoring of these identified concerns and problems on the part of citizens and businesses in the internal market, with a view to updating them. It is consequently citizens who remain the centre of attention for the EU, and I am pleased that in this report we are once again giving expression to that.</p>

In this respect, revitalising and strengthening the efficiency of the single market, consisting of over 500 million consumers and economic activities in excess of EUR 11 billion, is essential to enable Europe to achieve economic growth and employment, as well as to win the confidence of its citizens.

This could contribute to stronger economic growth, but would not require additional resources for the establishment of rescue and growth funds. It would thus contribute to innovation, growth, the promotion of competitiveness, job creation and increased market confidence. However, European citizens still encounter a range of impediments and discriminatory demands in the single market. Examples are difficulties in opening bank accounts and an inability, in practice, to change their energy supplier, because of a lack of clear and comparable information. Changing internet service provider is still in many cases complicated and expensive, and the digital market is not currently a reality in the European Union. Many more items could be added to this list. What is most important now, however, is to give a fresh impetus to the development of the single market.

Its essence is the embodiment of an area without internal borders where people, goods, services and capital can move freely. Many citizens of the EU, including many citizens of Poland, have benefited from these freedoms. Unfortunately, many individuals feel that there is a lack of information, and frequently people do not know – or do not sufficiently understand – their rights. They do not know how to obtain the required answers or assistance. This is something that the EU must try to fix. I believe that involving local and regional authorities in the process of informing citizens about their rights within the Single Market would be a good start. I completely agree that EU action is necessary and should be targeted and focused on the day-to-day problems faced by citizens. In addition, we have to review of all regulations which negatively impact SMEs, because they are the backbone of our economy.</p>

Since the Commission’s report on the 20 main concerns in 2011, it has become clear that there is a need for an initiative that is directly aimed at the concerns of European citizens and companies in connection with the single market. Much has already been done in the form of assistance for companies through the SOLVIT network, which is able to offer help if companies experience problems associated with Directives that are implemented in different ways in the different Member States. We are also helping to ensure that consumers have access to consumer complaints boards throughout Europe, in addition to electronic access via the internet. There is also more in the pipeline. Earlier this month, the Commission published the ‘Single Market Act II’, which focuses on the implementation of the Digital single market, as this is where the greatest untapped growth potential lies. There are still many areas to address before we can declare that the single market has been fully implemented; however, the foundations have long been laid, and the report on the 20 main concerns provides us with a clear vision of where improvements can be made.

However, ironically, these two reports have another point in common: they draw no conclusions from the repudiation of the neoliberal experience. On the contrary, they call for increased competition, greater flexibility of ‘labour’ and the complete liberalisation of the energy market. This is a perfect example of the inability to listen of the liberal majority, which holds the reins of the European institutions. I voted against the report.</p>

The single market has provided benefits for large European companies, but it has also brought with it detrimental consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises, such as bankruptcy and closure. Small and medium-sized enterprises are responsible for the majority of employment in Europe, and are therefore of vital importance. I believe that the concerns set out in the report – difficulties opening a new account or using a technical service in another country – do not reflect the true reality of the vast majority of European citizens today, who have bigger problems such as unemployment, casualisation or losing rights.</p>

Above all there is a gap between expectations and reality with regard to the single market. This gap is due to a number of interconnected shortcomings such as a lack of information (people frequently do not know their rights), gaps in application (in many areas there is a gulf between the EU legal framework and the ways in which legislation is applied in practice), and a legislative vacuum (in certain areas the EU legal framework does not meet the expectations of citizens and businesses).</p>

This own-initiative report presents an overall picture of the practical obstacles (information, implementation, legislative gaps).

In particular, Parliament underlines both the fact that 30 million European citizens are being prevented from opening a bank account by the banks themselves, thus impeding mobility within the single market, and the fact that the introduction of a European Professional Card is essential to speed up the recognition of professional qualifications, and therefore facilitate the mobility of workers between Member States.

      <p sl="fr">This year, as we celebrate 20 years of the single market, it has to be acknowledged that citizens and businesses are still not reaping the full benefits of it. They face three types of obstacle: a lack of information on existing rules, gaps in the transposition of European legislation into national law, and an absence of legislation. With this resolution, we urge the Commission to take certain measures to overcome these obstacles. At a time when Europe is suffering from both an economic and a legitimacy crisis, it seems more critical than ever to ensure that citizens and businesses make the most of what the single market has to offer. In the run-up to this text, I specifically stressed the importance of overcoming the lack of information for citizens on their rights within the EU. I was therefore particularly pleased that the text adopted reminds the Commission and the Member States of the need to raise the profile of the ‘Europe Direct’ service among citizens.

Particularly important for our group was that the report keep a good balance between the focus on the concerns of citizens and of businesses: regarding citizens' concerns, we paid particular attention to the recognition of professional qualifications and the access of young people to labour, and regarding businesses' concerns, we emphasised particularly the place of SMEs.</p>

I agree completely with the analysis presented in the resolution adopted today, namely that these concerns are due to three gaps: the first relating to information, the second relating to application and the third to the legal vacuum. I welcome the proposal that invites Member States to set up a one-stop shop for all mobile people in the EU, enabling them to handle their work- and home-related administrative matters and to be informed about their rights and obligations at a single location in the host country. Not only does it facilitate the day-to-day lives of expatriate citizens, but it also encourages the mobility of all citizens and the exchange of best practice between all national administrations. To my mind, this type of initiative fosters a genuine connection between all Europeans.</p>

Similarly, the single market cannot be invoked as the solution to every problem in Europe.

This is despite a significant lack of information available to European citizens about the single market, making it almost impossible to surmount the obstacles to accessing the benefits it brings.

      <p sl="pl">The main aim of creating a single European market was meant to be the establishment of closer bonds between citizens and Member States of the EU through the functioning of a borderless space for the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. Today, after 20 years with a functioning single market, besides the many significant benefits that have arisen from it, we can see that there are some discrepancies in the treatment of citizens and businesses, which to some extent rightly serves as a cause for their many concerns. This chiefly concerns the implementation of rights in the area of occupational qualifications, transfer of pension and social security rights and obstacles of a fiscal nature. We should give recognition to the European Commission’s actions hitherto raised to stimulate economic growth and strengthen trust in and the competitiveness of the single market. There is, however, still much to be done, especially where adapting the EU’s legal framework to existing economic and social conditions and the expectations of citizens and businesses is concerned, as well as full harmonisation of EU law with the law of Member States or the need to provide citizens with more complete information on the rights which are their due. To this end we need to strengthen cooperation between Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States. This would appear to be the only way to make it possible, under the conditions of economic, financial and social crisis that are prevailing in Europe, to surmount the obstacles standing in the way of innovation, economic growth, promotion of competitiveness and creation of new jobs, as well as creating trust in the single market among Europe’s citizens.</p>

Moreover, it also advocates the completion of the internal energy market and a competitive digital single market, the liberalisation of public procurement and the rail sector, implementation of the cross-border healthcare directive, and coordinating education systems with the needs of the labour market. For the more economically vulnerable countries, the internal market, that is to say, policies of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation of the economy, has meant that their productive capacity has been destroyed, their exports have declined, and their imports in sectors like energy and food have risen, leaving them extremely dependent on other countries, as is the case with Portugal.

I agree that we must bring about gender balance in all institutional management bodies, but these decisions are taken at another level. To penalise Mr Mersch on the basis of gender criteria may itself lead to discrimination.</p>

The European Union – and the European Parliament in particular – has always been particularly active in advocating women’s rights, gender equality and the utmost respect for parity in our public institutions and companies.

      <p sl="en">I believe that Mr Yves Mersch is an excellent candidate, more than qualified to serve on the board of the ECB. In particular I have been deeply impressed with Mr Mersch’s foresight on the current economic crisis and his recognition that our economic recovery demands continued commitment to austerity measures combined with further structural reforms of the eurozone economies. I am also of the belief that his doubts concerning the efficacy of a financial transaction tax are well considered and strongly agree that such a tax would simply serve to deliver added pressure to banks and financial institutions trying to improve their capital position. However, I do have some reservations concerning the selection procedure that resulted in no female candidates and recognise that if Mr Mersch is appointed the ECB board will be all male up until 2018. This is no reflection on Mr Mersch himself, who I believe to be more than qualified for this position.</p>

      <p sl="sk">By letter of 13 July 2012, received on 18 July 2012, the European Council consulted Parliament on the appointment of Yves Mersch as a Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) for a term of office of eight years. Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs then proceeded to evaluate the credentials of the nominee; it subsequently held a hearing with the nominee at which he made an opening statement and then responded to questions from the members of the committee. From the creation of the ECB, until the departure of Ms Tumpel-Gugerell, there had always been a female member of the Executive Board of the ECB. By letter of 19 September, the President of the European Parliament, following a meeting of the Conference of Presidents, requested that the President of the European Council make a commitment to ensure that all of the Union’s institutions under his responsibility should implement concrete measures to ensure gender balance. Ultimately, Parliament did not agree to the Council recommendation to appoint Yves Mersch as a Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and requests that the recommendation be withdrawn and that a new one be submitted to Parliament.</p>

Since only 674 MEPs took part in the vote, there was no qualified majority against Yves Mersch. Therefore, the parliamentary vote carries even less weight, since, according to the Treaty, Parliament may only issue an opinion. The ECB is the central bank of the euro area, which is made up of 17 countries represented in Parliament by 481 MEPs, while 273 MEPs are from countries that are not part of the euro area. These MEPs also took part in the vote, which actually concerns only the euro area. Many of these 273 MEPs are anti-European and voted against Mr Mersch, the scapegoat not only for pseudo-feminists, but also for the enemies of Europe and of the euro in particular. Faced with a unanimous proposal from finance ministers and a positive opinion from the Governing Council of the ECB, the opinion of the European Parliament carries little weight. The European Council must carry on regardless and appoint Mr Mersch without further ado to the ECB Executive Board, which has had a vacant seat since last May.</p>

I would like to refer to my proposal of 13 September 2012, published in Le Jeudi , calling on the relevant authorities to look beyond the six members of the Executive Board of the ECB and consider the economic, financial and monetary aspect of the EU as a whole. There was a real prospect of a high-level solution: the European Council needed only to agree to prioritise the appointment of women to senior posts in the near future. With this compromise, no one would have lost face, and the provisions of the Treaty on non-discrimination would have been upheld.</p>

There was only one objection against him: that he was male. I cannot believe it! At the height of the debt crisis in the euro area, this Chamber has become a place for exercises in gender politics. I find this demeaning and irresponsible. We can, however, also detect some unspoken motives: Mr Mersch has conservative fiscal views, is against the taxation of financial transactions, and is Governor of the central bank of the small country of Luxembourg. Well, how can one not reject him! To top it all, he is male! I myself have advocated a number of measures to reduce the gender imbalance in the European institutions. I never imagined that their underlying principles could be applied in such a grotesque manner.

Instead, I think we should have a wider choice, perhaps even a shortlist of names, from which to choose. There have also been criticisms of this appointment on the grounds that it would mean there were no women on the ECB’s Executive Board. I am not a supporter of quotas for women because I think they are counterproductive and can also be humiliating for very capable women.

Although not binding, this vote sends out a clear political signal about the legitimate concerns that governments in European countries cannot ignore.

The lack of representation of women in the highest decision-making bodies during the current euro crisis is a woeful state of affairs and confirms the impression of an ‘old boys’ network’. Unfortunately, and despite assurances from the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, that both male and female candidates would be considered to replace Mr González-Páramo, no female candidate was selected. Yet there is no shortage of qualified candidates: the appointment by the Greens of Karoline Linnert (Bremen) and Monika Heinold (Schleswig-Holstein) as finance ministers in two regions of Germany shows that gender diversity is predominantly a question of political will. The failure to consider any female candidates, despite these assurances, has left MEPs with no alternative.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Anti-dumping duties result from an investigation carried out by the Commission from a tip-off from one or several EU producers, where they suspect certain countries/businesses of dumping practices. When, as the result of an investigation, the Commission finds dumping exists and that it causes damage to the EU, definitive anti-dumping duties are adopted, normally for a period of five years. However, the measures can be amended or even cancelled during this period. The sampling technique for individual treatment or market economy treatment claims has been deemed inapplicable by the Court of Justice of the European Union. This decision must be taken into account and the related legislation amended accordingly. The Union’s action and the positions it takes on international trade relations should be guided by the need to protect the European economy from unfair practices that might distort competition. When doing so, this need must be kept in mind.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union (EU) is an area where approximately 500 million consumers live, making this area a desirable market for the major economic powers, particularly the ‘BRICs’ (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Many of the products that flood European markets seek to trick their way through customs checks and avoid recognition and certification processes. The European Parliament adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 to prevent European consumers from being duped. The report under consideration debates the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. Pursuant to Article 1(2) of the aforementioned Regulation, ‘A product is to be considered as being dumped if its export price to the Community is less than a comparable price for the like product, in the ordinary course of trade, as established for the exporting country’. As I believe it is crucial that we increase legal certainty as regards defending products from the Member States against imports and taking into account the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I am voting in favour.</p>

The proposal to amend this regulation stems from a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-249/10 P – Brosmann Footwear (HK) and others v Council of the European Union, which annulled Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitely the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain footwear with uppers of leather originating in the People’s Republic of China and Vietnam. In that judgment, the Court of Justice ruled that the sampling technique laid down in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 could not be applied in that case, and concluded that the cooperating producers that were not part of the sample were entitled to have their market economy treatment claim examined, regardless of whether an individual dumping margin needed to be calculated for those companies not included in the sample. In the Commission’s understanding, this decision would engender a disproportionate administrative burden for those responsible for the investigation.

      <p sl="pl">Having analysed the ‘Brosmann’ case against the Council, in which, on 2 February 2012, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a sentence establishing a precedent, the Committee on International Trade has taken the right decision to accept the Commission’s proposal altering the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. This was a matter of urgency, because following the ECJ’s ruling this regulation had ceased to be valid as regards its use for the purposes of the determination of claims of individual market economy treatment made under Article 2(7)(c). The ECJ’s verdict proved that there is a need to introduce a provision clarifying that the decision to limit the investigation to a reasonable number of producers by using samples on the basis of Article 17 of the regulation also applies to the parties subject to a market economy treatment examination, in accordance with Article 3(7)(b) and (c). I also agree with the position taken by the Committee on International Trade that there is a need to introduce legal certainty and to unify the regulation with the Court’s guidelines, and also to add an amendment stipulating the time for investigation in dumping cases, which must be more realistic. I therefore support the proposal to introduce a seven-month investigation period with the potential for it to be extended by a further month in important documented instances.</p>

The practice of artificially low wages compared to wealth generated and to European wages (wage dumping), the existence of tax exemptions or reduced taxes for companies (tax dumping) and the danger to the ecosystem (environmental dumping) are all criteria that should have been used to determine whether or not dumping is taking place. Instead, the Committee on International Trade contented itself with approving the Commission’s proposal that it could judge, more arbitrarily and without having to respect deadlines, which undertaking merited ‘market economy treatment’.

If this policy was implemented successfully, the European Union would gain about 420 000 new jobs, while European exports to Japan would rise by 30 %. This is particularly urgent in the light of high unemployment rates and poor growth projections in the EU. I agree with the rapporteur that the Japanese Government should reconfirm at the onset of formal negotiations of an EU-Japan FTA its commitments with regard to removing non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs).

      <p sl="fr">(This report seeks to start negotiations with a view to a possible global trade agreement between the European Union and Japan. Representing one of the most ambitious goals of EU trade strategy, it will require success in removing numerous technical obstacles and overcoming pointless differences and excessively rigid regulatory standards between these two parts of the world.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of launching negotiations with Japan on the free trade agreement. It is crucial for the EU to comprehensively deepen its economic and trade relationship with this country, which is one of the most economically influential in the world. This cooperation is particularly urgent in the light of the ongoing economic crisis, high unemployment rates and poor growth projections in the EU. Bilateral trading volume with Japan is dramatically lower than with other partners such as the USA, China and Russia. A free trade agreement would create favourable conditions for trade, and once non-tariff barriers are removed, EU exports to Japan could rise by about 70 %. In order to take advantage of the huge potential of the EU-Japanese commercial relationship, it is important for the Japanese Government to commit to dismantling non-tariff trade barriers. I also support the proposals for concessions on public procurement that would guarantee market access for European companies in strategic Japanese sectors. I agree that an effective dispute resolution mechanism should be established to combat the development of new non-tariff trade barriers and obstacles to market access in public procurement in Japan.</p>

The agreement could prompt the Japanese car industry to invest more in Europe and in Hungary, and thus create new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">(Without falling into the trap of protectionism, which would clearly lead us straight back into recession, Europe has manifestly failed in its duty to ensure the elementary principle of reciprocity in its trade agreements with third countries. While one cannot talk about Europe being a ‘pushover’, or having a gap in its ‘fence’, it is nevertheless certain that we need to take a firmer tone with all of our partners to be sure that our agreements are viable. Japan is a major test in this context. It is a great industrial and trade power, an undisputed world power in Asia, and the European Union has everything to gain by increasing its trade partnership. Nevertheless, this partnership should be concluded on a healthy and reciprocal basis, which, at this stage in the negotiations, is not always the case.</p>

      <p sl="fr">After the EU-Korea agreement, which caused a considerable stir two years ago, Parliament gave its approval for the EU to start free trade negotiations with Japan. While it is true that increased trade could bring considerable benefits in terms of growth and jobs, Parliament wanted to make it clear that negotiations should be suspended if Japan refused to lift the barriers in key sectors, in particular the automotive sector. We also sought a binding clause concerning review within a time limit of one year from the start of negotiations, in order to assess whether Japan has achieved tangible results in eliminating non-tariff barriers. Equally, the EU can no longer allow itself to negotiate trade agreements without gaining reciprocity in term of market access to public procurement. Only proportionate and reciprocal trade will make it possible to restore growth and create jobs in Europe and the world.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is essential that the EU explore all the possibilities for advantageous business which could offset the economic crisis. The EU and Japan together account for more than a third of global GDP and more than 20 % of world trade. Although bilateral EU-Japan trade is considerably smaller in size than with other countries such as the USA, China and Russia, we can deduce that it is far from reaching its potential. In one of the initial negotiating rounds of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the Commission should eliminate non-tariff barriers (NTB) whilst at the same time ensure that an impact study is completed a year after negotiations begin to gauge the noteworthy progress made in cooperation. Assuming that Japan will abolish NTBs and barriers to access to the public procurement market, this FTA should be ambitious and compatible with all trading determinations. If, at any moment, Japan demonstrates a lack of ambition or like-mindedness with regard to the EU’s priorities, the Commission should consult Parliament and the Council so they may suspend the negotiations. I therefore support a trading relationship between the EU and Japan, and am sure that it will have a positive economic impact for both economies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Concluding a free trade agreement with Japan may be beneficial to the EU, its businesses and its workers. I am therefore very pleased that Parliament has given its accord to the launch of negotiations. In order for these to be successful it is, however, essential that the negotiators ensure that concessions are made on the Japanese side, notably with regard to lifting of non-tariff barriers and public procurement (particularly for postal services and transport). That is why Parliament is seeking to make it possible to suspend negotiations automatically if Japan does not make the necessary efforts.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Union and Japan, two of the main global economic powers, owe it to themselves to maintain balanced trading relations. EU-Japan trade must therefore be based on principles of reciprocity and fairness so that both parties gain mutual benefits. That makes it essential that the Japanese authorities demonstrate a willingness to eliminate non-tariff barriers in their markets, particularly in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors. European businesses must be able to invest in Japanese markets under the same market access conditions as Japanese businesses in European markets. If Japan does not quickly produce tangible results on eliminating tariff barriers in its markets, the European Union could then suspend negotiations on possible conclusion of a free trade agreement. In fact, no one in Europe would understand if principles of balance and reciprocity were not applied between Japan and the EU, which are at comparable levels of development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The crisis the European Union (EU) faces obliges the European institutions to take advantage of all investment opportunities that promote Europe’s economic growth and help create more jobs. With this in mind, the trading potential of a country like Japan cannot be underestimated, as it is necessary to develop and strengthen bilateral trade relations. The potential for trade relations between the EU and Japan is enormous and is underexploited. Nevertheless, this Free Trade Agreement (FTA) must safeguard the interests of the European economy, chiefly with regard to certain sectors that could be affected. In return, we must demand that Japan should eliminate non-tariff barriers, allow European businesses to bid for public contracts and undertake to respect the values of the EU as regards human rights. The Parties have agreed on a timetable and a roadmap with stages to be fulfilled. The conditions are therefore met for starting negotiations with great prospects of success.

      <p sl="pt">This resolution seeks to set out Parliament’s priorities regarding the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement and calls on the Council to authorise the Commission to launch negotiations for this agreement. In Parliament’s view, Japan must eliminate non-tariff barriers (NTB) and this argument should be used as a bartering tool towards concluding the agreement. It stipulates the inclusion of a binding review clause to assess Japan’s progress in this area. It emphasises the fact that concluding this agreement would be to the benefit ‘of EU businesses, workers and consumers’. In other words, the usual rhetoric. There are contradictions that have already emerged that need to be highlighted and which could well influence how the negotiations pan out. These are the ‘offensive’ and especially ‘defensive’ interests of the German car industry that are in question in this case, given the size and importance of the Japanese industry in this sector. Let us face the facts – these are much more powerful interests than those represented, for example, by the Portuguese textile sector, which was hit so hard in previous liberalisations negotiated by the high and mighty of this EU, or other low to medium technological intensity sectors – which have faced the subsequent destruction of manufacturing and job losses.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The resolution on EU trade negotiations with Japan was adopted by a large majority. The purpose of this resolution was to debate the appropriateness of launching negotiations on a free trade agreement with Japan. Faced with the new challenges presented by globalisation, most MEPs consider it essential for the EU to deepen its trade relations with the major world economies, in particular Japan, in order to make maximum use of jobs and growth potential under the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I very much regret that negotiations on a free trade agreement have been opened now. In my view, we are still going too fast. Furthermore, like the negotiations with India and Mercosur, these negotiations may never lead anywhere. Japan is, it is true, a major trading partner for the European Union but the question is whether we may completely trust it. Before launching ourselves into such negotiations, we should have waited for concrete signs of goodwill on the Japanese side. It must be noted that it has still not done away with a significant number of non-tariff barriers and technical obstacles to trade that make its market difficult to penetrate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In my view, the all-important question for the EU is a multilateral enhancement of economic and trade relations with Japan. Today’s data leave a lot to be desired: in 2011 the total amount of bilateral trade in goods between the EU and Japan was worth only EUR 116.4 billion, in contrast to EUR 444.7 billion for EU-USA, EUR 428.3 billion for EU-China and EUR 306.6 billion for EU-Russia. I am convinced that an EU-Japan free trade agreement could bring benefits for both economies. We would also like our partners in Japan to ensure that non-tariff barriers are effectively removed, in order to do away with the significant percentage of barriers making trade between the EU and Japan difficult. I am thinking here of non-tariff trade barriers in the automotive sector, such as the regulations relating to development planning and other restrictions that do not promote competition, and the procedure where electric and hybrid vehicles are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="fr">My colleagues and I voted in favour of starting free trade negotiations with Japan. Increased trade with that country, which is one of the world’s most significant trading blocs, could bring significant benefits in terms of growth and jobs. However, the European Union must show firmness and suspend negotiations if Japan refuses to lift obstacles in the key sectors, particularly concerning the automotive industry or the embargo on European beef, in force since the BSE crisis. Reciprocity must be the watchword. A binding clause was, moreover, added by the rapporteur, Mr Kazak, in order to assess progress in the discussions over one year. Adoption of this text is important from a commercial viewpoint, given the economic weight of our Japanese partner. In 2011 Japan’s trade surplus with the European Union was EUR 18.5 billion, out of a total EUR 116.4 billion of trade, and there is scope for it to increase significantly. By way of comparison, trade between the EU and the United States amounted to EUR 444.7 billion in the same year.</p>

Moreover, we do not find it ethically or politically correct to demand unilateral concessions before you even start negotiations. While certain NTBs are indeed administrative decisions of questionable motivation and prohibit fair reciprocal market access, they ought to be tackled within the framework of negotiations for a trade agreement.</p>

      <p sl="fr">While I support most of its conclusions, in particular the one stating that negotiations must lead to genuine market openness and trade facilitation on the ground, rather than just a hypothetical legal openness, I nevertheless abstained from voting on this resolution on possible launching of trade negotiations with Japan. Set up in the 1990s, the EU-Japan High Level Group given the task of harmonising our rules has only managed to make progress on three texts; Japanese non-tariff barriers are still too numerous and public procurement markets too closed. Good intentions and media headlines are not enough; they must be matched by a lot of work and strong political will. Yet, for now, such political will does not seem to be emerging on the Japanese side. I expect the same lucidity and the same pragmatism from the European Commission, and I hope it does not start negotiations until it is sure that an agreement will be genuinely profitable for both parties.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There is no doubt that the commencement of a parallel negotiation process on the subject of a binding understanding covering global political cooperation, and particularly as regards a free trade agreement between EU Member States and Japan, was a significant event for the European Union in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="pl">After China and the USA, the European Union is the third-largest trading partner of Japan, whereas Japan is the sixth-largest trading partner for the EU. The value of the bilateral trade turnover for the first 10 months of 2011 was around USD 145.2 billion. The EU is also the second-largest investor in Japan (USD 175 billion), whereas Japan is the third-largest investor in the EU (USD 75 billion). There are some 3 300 companies operating in the EU with some involvement of Japanese capital, and these provide employment for around 400 000 people.</p>
      <p sl="pl">With the above data in mind, I am convinced that the potential for cooperation between Japan and the EU in the trade and investment sphere continues to be under-utilised, particularly since, when all is said and done, this trade between the two markets should be a factor stimulating waning economic growth, and not the opposite. Attention should therefore be focussed both on factors that could currently retard commercial and economic cooperation between the two countries, and on factors which could stimulate such commercial exchange.</p>

Now that the scoping exercise is complete, negotiations can begin on the agreement, drawing on experience with the agreement with South Korea. In that particular case, while there were advantages for service companies, damage was done to the European automotive industry. Any future agreement with Japan must make distinctions between different sectors to prevent damage to industries that provide work for thousands of people and that are an important part of the real economy as opposed to finance and service companies, which produce capital that is not distributed throughout the population.</p>

Firstly, I would like to avoid the unpleasant surprise experienced on reading the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA Agreement), which contained numerous paragraphs taken from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade (ACTA) Agreement rejected by Parliament. I would therefore like trade agreements to deal only with trade. Next, the Japanese system still does not allow all of our products to be exported. I therefore ask that access conditions be entirely reciprocal.

      <p sl="pt">Both the EU and Japan have shown a desire to open trade negotiations that step up the economic integration between both parties. Japan has revealed its intention to remove non-tariff barriers in the automotive sector and in public procurement. The desire of the two blocks to establish a free trade agreement was reaffirmed at the 2011 EU-Japan Summit. According to the Commission’s data, a trade agreement with Japan would have a major economic impact on the EU, with the potential for 420 000 new jobs and a potential increase of some 23.5 % in European exports. However, if non-tariff barriers to trade were reduced as far as possible, there could be a possible 71 % increase in EU exports to Japan and a 61 % increase in Japan’s exports to the EU. Together, the EU and Japan currently account for more than a third of global GDP and more than 20 % of world trade. I am therefore voting in favour of opening trade negotiations with Japan, given the socio-economic benefits that the signing of a trade agreement between the two blocks will entail.</p>

At the same time, in the light of the March 2011 disaster, heavy emphasis must be placed on energy cooperation and enhanced market access in environmental goods and services.</p>

Taking the experience gained from the agreement on free trade between the EU and South Korea as a model, we should raise the volume of trade with Japan by a significant amount. Furthermore, in terms of globalisation in its wider sense, having Japan as a political ally might not be a bad thing.

It is therefore crucial that synergies be created between the EU’s policies, as Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) presents an opportunity for the EU to forge equal and sustainable partnerships with developing countries that go beyond development cooperation. The report also highlights the fact that Parliament, as co-legislator, has a key responsibility for translating the commitments into concrete policies. I also agree with the fact that the reports calls on the Member States and their national parliaments to promote PCD through a specific working programme with binding timetables and the fact that it calls for the introduction of structured annual meetings between representatives of the EU’s national parliaments.

      <p sl="ro">The European Union’s development policy and the way in which the Union provides humanitarian or political aid are essential not only to overcome many of the global or regional problems we face, but also as a tool for the organisation of international society on new foundations. At the same time, the European Union must offer states experiencing economic problems the prospect of their own growth and development. An important institutional item on the European Union’s agenda is greater efficiency for these foreign policy tools and mechanisms. In the absence of closer and more coherent coordination between different sectoral policies, we are in danger of losing resources and failing to achieve primary objectives. Boosting institutional cooperation within the European Union is equally important.

Economic partnership agreements and free trade agreements promoting and supporting development in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states should receive particular attention.

However, the more rapid growth in the global population is smothering the slower economic growth. The phenomenon of globalisation is contributing to this, and while the forces and powers between states are balancing out, the chasms within countries between the rich and the poor is becoming ever deeper. This is best illustrated by the development of Brazil, China and India. The changes underway in Africa are promising; a growing number of countries are holding free elections and are more open to the principle of political rotation. The African Union is devoting significant efforts to managing problems at regional level, but it already appears that the Millennium Development Goals set in 2000 will not be accomplished by 2015. Europe, then, as the largest sponsor of the ‘Agenda for Change’ programme, is obliged to accelerate the implementation of the programme and enhance its efficiency. This is because the most pressing problem for some emerging markets is not producing goods but distributing them fairly. The five main objectives in the proposal are principally aimed at supporting the fight against poverty, in view of the new players such as China and India, or new phenomena like the extremely high birth rates.</p>

By doing this, the EU will not only be contributing towards reducing poverty, but will also be encouraging developing countries to set up their own market structures, creating jobs, and to be able to compete as trading partners for the EU in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report under examination, by Birgit Schnieber-Jastram, focuses on the European Union (EU) report on Policy Coherence for Development. The objective of development policies is to eradicate instances of poverty throughout the world so that all peoples enjoy a life with a minimum level of quality, both in terms of safety and comfort. For this reason, various positions and measures have been taken to address instances of poverty that should shame so-called modern societies. The Millennium Development Goals, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, more recently, the Europe 2020 strategy enshrine as a priority the reduction and long-term eradication of poverty which, as we know, essentially affect the more disadvantaged classes, children and women. Bearing in mind the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I am voting in favour of this report and hope that the recommendations it contains will be duly taken into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Many times we have called Parliament’s attention to the issue of Policy Coherence for Development (PCD). We emphatically denounce the inconsistency of the EU’s sectoral policies with the objectives declared in the area of development cooperation. This report highlights several important aspects which we value, such as: insufficient health funding; the failure of a substantial proportion of the Fisheries Agreements, in particular the poor results obtained in areas of scientific and technological cooperation and sustainable development of the sector (an aspect that we underscored in the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, for which we were the rapporteurs); the importance of policies promoting equality between men and women; and the recognition of the right of each country to define by democratic means its own policies, priorities and strategies. Regrettably, other aspects have been overlooked or not appropriately addressed. The ‘brain drain’ issue (without calling into question the effects of the Blue Card on developing countries); the continued existence of tax havens and the flight of capital and economic crime which they usher in; the question of access to raw materials from developing countries with no regard for local development and poverty eradication goals. These are but a few examples. We therefore abstain.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty, as defined in the European Consensus on Development, as the primary objective of EU development policy. It is important for the Union to take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements and which are likely to affect developing countries. Unfortunately, there are clear inconsistencies in the EU's trade, agriculture, fisheries, climate, intellectual property rights, migration, finance, arms and raw materials policies which affect development goals. The fact that policy coherence for development has the potential to contribute to poverty reduction by finding fundamental synergies among EU policies is important. A post-2015 international framework for development cooperation has the potential to play a catalytic role in addressing important development and other global challenges and could help to fulfil individuals’ rights and needs. I believe it is important to strive to achieve, inter alia, transparency in all areas of the issue, as it is instrumental in achieving policy coherence for development.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for this report because it has the merit of sending a strong political signal that calls on the EU and all Member States to ensure Policy Coherence for Development in an effective and intelligent way. This report stresses the importance of building sustainable partnerships based on equality, human rights, equal opportunities and respect for the environment. In addition, as a framework for EU development policy, policy coherence for development requires transparency in all areas of development aid, particularly aid to local and smallholder producers, aid for countries in conflict or post-conflict situations, promotion of fundamental rights, migration and human mobility. Moreover, the report suggests complementing the concept of aid effectiveness with the concept of development effectiveness, which promotes open and comprehensive dialogue between partners. Lastly, it is essential that the European External Action Service (EEAS), Member States and all relevant stakeholders, that is to say, national parliaments, civil society and international organisations, give themselves sufficient resources to ensure that these proposals are implemented rather than going unheeded.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Union plays a crucial role in development policy, where the main objective is reducing poverty and eliminating it in the long run; this goal would be greatly facilitated if the EU made efficient use of the fundamental synergies between Union policies. In the field of development cooperation, the action taken by the European Union is based on collaboration between Member States and international bodies, creating harmony between European policies and development objectives, and on the principle of aid efficiency. I personally agree with the part of the draft report which states that the 3.4 % of the Commission development aid budget allocated to direct nutrition intervention is insufficient, especially with malnutrition causing the death of around 2.6 million children each year. I am delighted that the report highlights the corporate social responsibility obligations of enterprises, to encourage employers to apply social standards which are more ambitious than is currently the case. In agreement with the rapporteur I also find it unsatisfactory that – despite a promise from the Commission – there was no proposed extension of the powers of scrutiny of the European Regional Development Fund to Parliament. If the proposals in the report are implemented I believe we can make more effective progress in ensuring policies are coherent for development purposes, and therefore I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) has become a very important subject in the debate on EU development policy. The Treaty of Lisbon makes eradication of poverty an overall goal of EU development policy (Article 21) and, with the aim of achieving this goal, states the need for a coherent approach in terms of EU external action, covering trade, agriculture, fisheries, climate change and tax havens (Article 208). Unfortunately, the report in question is not an evaluation of implementation of PCD or its weaknesses. Rather, it is a report on what PCD should be. There are positive elements in the report, such as recognition of the right of developing countries to define their own policies by democratic means and to protect their economy. However, I could not allow myself, in the name, indeed, of genuine Policy Coherence for Development, to vote in favour of a resolution that encourages the expansion of agri-fuels in developing countries and supports agro-industry. That contributes towards land grabbing and runs wholly contrary to the notion of food sovereignty.</p>

Viewed as a political responsibility, EU development policy should, according to the Schnieber-Jastram report, have five areas of focus. These are European partnership agreements, agricultural and fisheries policy, climate change and energy, migration and security.

Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union speaks of reducing, and, in the long term, eradicating, poverty, as a primary objective of Union development policy. I wish to draw attention to one very important issue: at present only approximately EUR 418 million, or around 3.4 % of the total Commission development aid budget of EUR 12 billion per year, is currently allocated to direct nutrition intervention. In my view this is too small a sum, when you remember that about one third of the pre-school age children in the world currently suffer from underweight or stunting. Malnutrition kills an estimated 2.6 million children each year and, if unchecked, will put almost half a billion children at risk of permanent damage in the next 15 years.</p>

Development projects and goals must be shared between member countries. EU nations must support each other as we move forward toward better infrastructure and sustainability. Fishing and farming must be ecologically sustainable in order to ensure future growth. Nations must also observe basic human rights by providing core labour standards and protection for migrants. Within the EU, we must strive to meet this goal.

This requirement for coherence is the result of the need for Parliament to monitor the work of the Commission, stressing important aspects that the Commission tends to avoid, such as the importance of effective monitoring of arms exports. I think the report is positive, as it also makes a clear call for preventing aid that is conditional on migration reduction, for not outsourcing migration control to third countries and for guaranteeing that the human rights of migrants are respected.

It is not just a question of reducing the economic, social and political differences between North and South, but of ensuring that these changes take place based on the principles of democracy, equality and social justice. It is worth emphasising the explicit recognition made of the right of a third country to define by democratic means its own policies, priorities and strategies, going on to offer clear development aid alternatives such as the establishment of fair trade between the EU and the affected countries or the creation of labour legislation that follows the principles set by the International Labour Organisation. Primary activities make up a major part of the economic reality of developing countries. To this end, the existence of up-to-date scientific data and studies on the social and economic impact of policies such as the fisheries policy point to a benefit both for these countries and the EU’s fishing zones.

      <p sl="en">The EU is rightly committed to global development, and we should all support the aims and ambitions of those populations who do not enjoy our resources and prosperity. However, development must not simply be aligned to per capita income: conditionality is key, necessitating a consideration of governance, democratic aspiration and institutional corruption. Such an approach enables a quid pro quo whereby more progress earns more aid. We must also aim for a more nuanced approach that treats each country on its own terms; for example, India, despite its low per capita income, remains home to some of the world's richest inhabitants and its government boasts ample resources to help the poorest citizens without current levels of EU intervention. If we therefore improve the targeting of aid and incentivise the delivery of domestic objectives, the EU can truly be instrumental in improving people's lives.</p>

Division into eight areas of action selected for the period 2011-2014 is a good choice. I would note, among other things, the proposed new policy on corporate social responsibility, the importance of binding corporate social responsibility obligations and the importance of encouraging employers to apply social standards which are more ambitious than current statutory provisions, including the possibility to develop and obtain a designation such as a social label. I also call on the Commission to encourage Member States to monitor implementation of these obligations rigorously. PCD is not merely a technical issue, but is primarily a political responsibility and Parliament, as co-legislator and as a democratically elected institution, has a key responsibility for translating the commitments into concrete policies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Parliament adopted a document today on the coherence of EU development policy. Welcoming the European Union’s efforts in the development field, the European Parliament emphasises the fact that this is not only a legal obligation, but that designing accountable, transparent, human-rights-based, and inclusive policies is a chance for the EU to establish equal and sustainable partnerships with developing countries that go beyond development cooperation.

      <p sl="ro">I support the Commission’s commitment to supporting small producers and promoting fair, organic and ethical trade initiatives. I believe that smallholder farming is particularly relevant in combating hunger and that adaptation measures are priorities in the food security agenda. In addition, support for women smallholder farmers is especially relevant and should be increased. I voted in favour of developing an integrated approach to nutrition and setting up a dedicated trust fund to address the problem of malnutrition in developing countries and mobilising the necessary resources to deliver the basic interventions that could prevent the vast majority of malnutrition. To this end, it is essential for intervention to occur in particular in the critical 1 000-day window between conception and the age of two.</p>

The drafting and introduction of clear political strategies taking into account human rights allows us to hope that even and lasting partnership relationships will be struck up with developing countries. As part of this programme, a trade and investment policy is being put together, and also – which is of huge significance for my own country – a responsible agricultural and fisheries policy, although in this sector there is still a need to carry out conscientious and systematic monitoring of the use of funds. I am also pleased that the subject of safety has been raised together with the migration associated with it.

      <p sl="en">Michael Cashman publicly blamed Members voting against ‘sexual and reproductive health and rights’, following their conscience and the democratic mandate of their constituents. This incident in Chamber shows that the right to life of the unborn and freedom of conscience are threatened by the Socialist group. SRHR has not been defined officially until now. It is misused to promote abortion as a method of population control and family planning in developing countries by Euro-NGOs. As the San José Articles show, no international instrument can be used to found a human right to abortion. The EU Commission is funding SRHR, accepting that abortion is funded within SHRH programmes with taxpayers’ money. Sex-selective abortion is a consequence of the misuse of SRHR and indeed a matter of human rights. ‘It’s a girl’ are the three most dangerous words for a female foetus worldwide. Sex-selective abortion is not part of women’s rights. Following ECJ Decision C-34/10, any human ovum after fertilisation constitutes a ‘human embryo’ and should therefore be protected against destruction. I abstained at the final vote following my conscience and my mandate. I strongly reject the allegation by Michael Cashman and deeply regret this incident showing publicly that freedom of conscience is persecuted by the Socialist Group in the Chamber.</p>

However, the report omits or undervalues aspects we believe are essential when addressing policy coherence for development, chiefly: the ‘brain drain’ issue; the continued existence of tax havens and the flight of capital and economic crime; the question of access to raw materials from developing countries with no regard for local development and poverty eradication goals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, through today’s debate on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments, we have advanced into the core area for financial market regulation within this legislative period; now we need to regulate the financial markets and not just look at individual products, as we did in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">I just want to pick out a few key terms. In the last year we have not made life easy for ourselves. We have conducted a hearing in committee, we have surveyed all the stakeholders and every interested group, and on this basis, through various processes, working documents and the like, produced a result which we are setting before this plenary session here today and tomorrow. I will take a few points from it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, market structure. On the one hand, we must concede that in recent years something has happened in the financial markets which has made it in Parliament’s interest that each trade in securities takes place under the MiFID rules, which is why we have approved a new category – bounded by many conditions – called Organised Trading Facilities, where only non-equities can be traded, where proprietary trading is forbidden and where, with regard to execution, transaction and customer interaction, execution may take place at the operator’s discretion. Through this process I think that we are making an important contribution to ensuring that the entire area of traded OTC papers is handled within the MiFID environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another major subject not considered in the last MiFID is algorithmic or high-frequency trading. Once again, we needed to issue clear rules here, so that these areas, which can be very dangerous and can be manipulatively employed, is subject to a strict system with minimum holding periods, trade interruption opportunities, the option to test algorithms, the option of examining algorithms within the supervisory structure, the introduction of tick-size regimes, a minimum price, and corresponding fee systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another subject I would like to touch on is the area of commodities futures markets. I do believe that we have a particular responsibility here, when it comes to restricting the speculative part of commodities futures markets, not to contribute through bad regulation to a situation where people in the third and fourth worlds can no longer buy food. Because of this, we have chosen a two-pronged approach with the aim of curbing speculation but not thereby damaging the real economy. We want to achieve this by using position limits with strict ceilings on the number of contracts or positions. We also want to ensure, by means of the position-check system, that those who can prove that they really need a product do not suddenly speculate in this market.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another issue that concerns us is the area of investor protection. I would like to point out here that we have chosen a very broad approach in guaranteeing protection for consumers and investors. This means that the requirements of specific customer groups need to be identified. Not every small saver needs access to highly complex papers. What is needed is to define the relevant products for target groups, carry out product testing, make telephone recordings, give relevant advice, disclosure requirements, but – I want to briefly mention – to proceed, with regard to commissions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Member States should be able, according to their structures, to make relevant accommodations. I think we are on the right track here.</p>
      <p sl="de">My time is running out, so I thank everyone who has been involved. I think it is a shame that we only have four minutes’ speaking time for such a complex report. I thank all my colleagues who collaborated on this and the Commission for the very constructive role it has played in recent weeks and months. I hope that a strong vote in the plenary session tomorrow will put us in a situation to negotiate with the Council in order to resolve this important report as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="4-354-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, good afternoon to you all, thank you for your kind words on the success and importance of the internal market week in Bucharest, as in the other capitals, where we led this debate throughout last week.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are talking about a major subject, which, as you know – and as Mr Ferber just reminded us – is a centrepiece of our regulatory agenda. I often show Ministers and Heads of State this table on the 29 texts that drive the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs led by Mr Bowles, all MEPs, coordinators and shadow rapporteurs to whom I extend my thanks. This central theme to some extent mirrors, for the financial markets, what we are doing with Mr Karas on capitalisation and prudential measures for the banking sector, so that, for financial markets as a whole, we have transparency, responsibility and also security for investors and savers, leaving no room − such is our goal − for regulatory arbitrage within the single market or with regard to other G20 partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I offer very sincere thanks to Mr Ferber for his commitment, sharing with him the goal – which he mentioned – of being in a position to begin trialogue discussions very soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">We share the same goals for MiFID in a number of areas, and your report, Mr Ferber, strengthens and consolidates our own proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, concerning market structure, the Commission and Parliament have as their goal that all forms of negotiation, whether multilateral or bilateral, should take place in an atmosphere of transparency. Parliament has elected to introduce a definition of the over-the-counter market, coupled with an obligation to trade on transparent execution venues in the case of small-scale transactions. I am prepared to explore this avenue; however, any removal of the Organised Trading Facility (OTF) category for the equity market must be analysed very carefully.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also carefully measure the effects of such amendments compared with our own proposal. If we limit multilateral trading solely to regulated markets and venues for multilateral trading facilities, that would amount to abandoning reform of the current situation, which has precisely the effect, on certain platforms, of allowing high-frequency traders to cross their orders with those of investors, without the latter having any say whatsoever. We must therefore think carefully before limiting the scope of OTFs in this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second point: high-frequency trading. If, honourable Members, we want to encourage transactions to migrate to multilateral, transparent trading venues, then yes, we must better constrain high-frequency trading, which is, indeed, in its element on such venues. In that regard, also, I think I may say that we share the same goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">In general terms, this text is the chance to start from scratch with rules on high-frequency trading; I am ready to acknowledge – as I have already said – that high-frequency trading has some usefulness in providing liquidity but it is also undeniably a source of systematic risk for the markets. In banking we have begun vigorous efforts to monitor and reduce this type of risk. We cannot and must not be any less ambitious with regard to markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Commission has proposed a set of specific rules to constrain these players and make them accountable. From now on, they will have to be authorised and supervised by the competent authorities. They will also have to undertake to provide the markets with liquidity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I offer sincere thanks to Mr Ferber, your rapporteur, for proposing to retain these points and I would also point out that the Commission continues to pursue this debate vigorously beyond the European Union, in international bodies, so that we can achieve a level regulatory playing field and demanding common standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third point: commodity derivatives markets. These are not the same as other financial markets, since their smooth operation touches the daily life of all consumers and, as we know, in some developing countries, involves and concerns the food security of a large section of the population. It seems to me that commodity speculation and the effects that such speculation may have on the food security of a number of countries are totally unacceptable. I would like to express very clearly my support for your proposals, which seek to strengthen your regime on position limits, while at the same time retaining the possibility for commercial undertakings to use these markets when it is genuinely a matter of hedging risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth point: introduction of a European regime for the provision of services by third-country firms. In that regard also, I am pleased that our proposal is supported by Parliament. I am convinced that this regime is the best means of ensuring effective regulation of international markets and avoiding any risk of regulatory arbitrage, as I said at the beginning of my speech. This is very important in the context of regulatory convergence at the level of both the G20 and the Financial Stability Board.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, this important debate gives me an opportunity to mention briefly two or three other areas where we should also remain highly demanding in regulatory terms. Firstly, pre-trading transparency. We must be firm and not risk, through specific provisions, allowing certain players to continue trading in an entirely opaque way. The transparency level should be the same, whatever the technology used and whatever the type of investor, retail or professional.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second area of vigilance: investor protection. We want to, and must, move towards legislation that improves investment conditions by clarifying the role and financial interests of each party. For that reason, mere disclosure of the commissions received by intermediaries would not make it possible, in my view, to ensure the proper level of investor protection, nor, moreover, sufficient independence. I believe the proposal we made to prohibit receipt of commissions for independent advice and portfolio management guarantees more security and independence. These are the only ways to attract sound investors and sound investment. We must also maintain our demands regarding the range of instruments that may be considered non-complex. Making it too broad would amount to increasing the risk that investors would then be sold inappropriate products.</p>
      <p sl="en">Final point: non-discriminatory access. I am convinced that it is necessary to create conditions for healthy competition in the area of post-trading in order to make financial markets into a genuine single market and prevent excessive concentration of risk within monopolistic market infrastructures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, Mr Ferber, that is what I wanted to say very openly, in the context of our ongoing dialogue. I appreciated Mr Ferber’s proposals. I confirm to him that I am available, as are my teams, to continue to work and successfully conclude the major piece of legislation that MiFID represents as quickly as possible and on an ambitious, rigorous and demanding basis. It is for us together to find the right balance to attract investor confidence and I have faith in our joint action to reach that goal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my role in this great financial market regulation process is limited to the issue of the extent to which industry is affected by financial market regulation – here I speak on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – since there is a need for financial market regulation, which we are addressing with this directive and regulation package.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there is a lot of activism involved in financial market regulation and the Commission’s first proposal on the subject would simply have led, through questions of definition and interpretation, to companies in the real economy – here I am thinking of smaller industrial enterprises such as German public utility companies and agricultural cooperatives – suddenly being treated like banks, for example when they hedge delivery relationships with suppliers and customers on the futures markets. This would have been the collateral damage of financial market regulation and would have been in no one’s interest. In my view it is clear that industrial companies must be treated differently to banks. The majority of futures transactions made by these companies are for hedging purposes, not speculation. Even where these transactions do involve speculation, it must be said that I do not know of a single industrial company or energy supplier that is of systemic importance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was very clear in its opinion on this subject and I must say that I am pleased that these aspects managed to appear in the final package. To that extent, in the end we certainly did well to include this ancillary aspect.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Ferber on the two reports submitted for discussion today. Thanks to the rapporteur’s particularly hard work, these two reports have been supported by all members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I express my hope that the European Parliament will vote in plenary by a large majority in favour of these two reports. I express this hope because both European regulations will close the regulatory loopholes in the markets where complex financial instruments, such as financial derivatives, are traded.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to underline that in my country, Romania, there was recently a major scandal caused precisely by transactions involving financial instruments in markets lacking in transparency which are not supervised by the authorities. These transactions caused losses to the investors and seriously affected the credibility of Romania’s stock exchange and supervisory authorities, even though the transactions concerned were not subject to supervision and were not linked to the Romanian stock exchange.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, investors have extremely limited opportunities to take the people who conducted these transactions to court in those cases where they breached the mandate given to them by investors. This is why I will vote in favour of both reports, so that the markets for OTC instruments and other platforms for trading financial instruments which are not subject to regulation and supervision can become transparent, protect investors’ interests and come under the supervision of the authorities in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have 120 seconds to express my group’s agreement with the compromise found. The proposed legislation will, firstly, provide greater transparency and will give the European regulator and national regulators more opportunities to intervene in order to prevent any abusive and harmful speculation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consumer interests will be better protected. The keyword will be total transparency of prices and commissions. Under subsidiarity, States will have several additional options, going as far as a ban on retrocession. A review clause will oblige the Commission to monitor developments and propose corrections where necessary. Our proposals will help to erect serious barriers to speculation on commodity markets, particularly for agricultural products. Players in these markets will be obliged to publish their commitments and limits will be imposed on the positions that a player or group of players may hold.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A key element is constraint of high-frequency trading (HFT). Where is the price discovery essential to markets when computers make deals with other computers in milliseconds, microseconds, and, tomorrow, nanoseconds? Speed does not mean more liquidity, Commissioner. In fact, high-frequency trading does not bring any liquidity to the market. Eighty per cent of orders only exist for a few milliseconds. While HFT represents, for some markets, up to 80 % of orders issued, daily trading reports for the major stock exchanges show that orders executed account for only a 20 to 25 % share of total stock market transactions. The fact of placing restrictions on such increasingly elusive speculation will help long-term investors and penalise daily bonus hunters. Financial markets are necessary but must serve the real economy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, thank you, Commissioner. I would also like to thank Mr Ferber for his successful work. This is a very technically complicated legislative proposal, and he has been successful in uniting Parliament with well-balanced compromises. The two legislative proposals form the basis for ensuring that savers regain some of the confidence they lost during the financial crash four years ago.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As has been mentioned, we are tightening the rules relating to high-frequency trading, and not everybody is entirely satisfied. A braking system must be implemented in order to reduce the risk of an uncontrolled stock market fall. We are increasing competition and transparency in the market by establishing a new trading platform, as has been mentioned by the Commissioner. We are ensuring that small bond markets (and I am being a little nationalistic here) such as the Swedish market have reasonable conditions. We are strengthening the protection for savers by tightening the rules on the marketing of savings products, as mentioned by the rapporteur. We are achieving – and this is important to me – greater freedom of choice, improved competition and a more robust and better-functioning capital market.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the matter of a ban on commission or inducements has been the most difficult thing to reach agreement over. Self-regulation and ethical guidelines have obviously not been sufficient to reduce the aggressive marketing of savings products. As a liberal, a market liberal, I admit there is a problem here. This I admit, Mr Goebbels.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A general EU ban on commission is the next step if the industry fails to get its act together. However, those of us in the liberal camp do not currently wish to see a complete ban on commission throughout the EU. Countries such as the UK or the Netherlands wishing to have more stringent rules have been allowed to implement such rules. The risk of introducing a complete ban is that sales will lead to those on lower incomes no longer being offered the advice they need free of charge. Small insurance brokers risk being eliminated.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, financial advice must be available to all citizens at a reasonable cost. Competition and supply must also not be impaired. Transparency and openness are extremely important. This forms an important part of guaranteeing greater protection for purchasers of savings products.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you for the generally good collaboration on this report. We have a Commission proposal that has already made great strides in the right direction but could be further improved in key areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the area of market structures there will be more transparency and there will be greater transparency as part of the MiFID in the area of derivatives trading. The resolutions of our compromise in the area of high-frequency trading go much further than what the Commission originally proposed and deserve the support of Parliament in their entirety. The report is moving in the right direction, even in areas that have attracted major public criticism. In the area of commodities and food speculation the report – after, it must be said, many difficult debates – is much stronger than the Commission’s resolutions, since position limits are now established as binding. However, we need further amendments in this area in order to close some gaps. I am hoping for additions through the plenary vote and also in the trialogue. It is pleasing that Mr Barnier has signalled his support of Parliament’s detailed proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the report does have weaknesses in the area of consumer protection. That we are now able to ban products is a sign of progress, but we have still made no changes in the area of commission-based advice. The marketing of financial products is still not orientated primarily towards the interests of consumers but dominated by products with the highest commissions. Consumers have lost a lot of money in Germany and everywhere else in the EU. Take open-ended property funds, for example. For citizens in, say, France, Italy, Spain and Germany, our compromise will unfortunately not change very much. The basic principle will remain the orientation of products around commissions. Referring to subsidiarity here is a bit simplistic. I would have liked to see stronger rules here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and colleagues for all their hard work on this dossier. One of the most important areas of MiFID is that of the extension of transparency requirements to the non-equity markets. At a time of unprecedented low growth and economic hardship across Europe, I am very glad that all groups in the European Parliament have come together to give strong support to a text that facilitates and supports investment in the corporate bond markets and the government bond markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">As banks are facing higher capita requirements, businesses need to look elsewhere to raise money and reduce their reliance on bank funding. The bond markets are the perfect place for this, but the market structure in Europe needs to support their needs and new transparency requirements need to be properly tailored to encourage investment. I think the European Parliament text does this and should inform the still on-going Council discussions in a similar way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am disappointed, however, that we have not yet managed to reach a political agreement to guarantee the highest possible level of investor protection for all consumers in the EU. While Member States will be allowed to ban all commissions and inducements, I think it is disappointing that the Socialist Group and others have chosen to protect bank business models over that of the end investors.</p>
      <p sl="en">My own Member State and the Netherlands are already well on the way to implementing a full ban. I can only hope that other Member States will shortly follow. A common misconception is that MiFID is about high-frequency trading and food speculation. We have, however, spent a lot of time discussing investor protection and G20 commitments as well. We have included requirements about minimum tick sizes, circuit breakers, algorithm testing and audit trails, all of which I think put it in the necessary scrutiny measures which do not hinder technological innovation but give safeguards and should therefore give retail and long-term investors confidence that they are not being subjected to unfair practices in the market place.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope other groups will support me in the vote tomorrow for the introduction of a requirement to synch all business clocks to one standard. As basic as this sounds, the only way we can have a properly-integrated surveillance system for regulators and market participants in a consolidated tape is if everyone is working to the same clock. At its heart, MiFID is about creating a positive environment for investors, both large and small, and for the companies that need to raise money in our markets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank my colleagues for the good work they have done together, but especially Mr Ferber. This has really been a very good, fair and open collaboration. It is not always this way, so it is much appreciated in this case. At this point I would also like to thank the non-governmental organisations. They made a significant contribution, especially in the area of food speculation. What may not be obvious, and I want to emphasise this, is that the rapporteur has also engaged in the process. It has not always been easy and comfortable. I do believe, however, that at that point it was very important and good that the non-governmental organisations were involved in working on this area. This process opened up the dry, heavy issue of financial market regulation a little to some of the people, the citizens. It does Parliament good to let such an important issue get out of this House a little.</p>
      <p sl="de">I echo what Mr Giegold said earlier. We have taken an important and good step in the area of food speculation. However, there are still a few questions with regard to omissions – there may still be a few loopholes there. Nevertheless, this will be revealed by experience and then we will have to re-work this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that what we have done on high-frequency trading is very deserving of support: I – and, I believe, the majority of my Group – can wholeheartedly support it. This is also not a matter of course, but on that point we have succeeded in creating something good and practical.</p>
      <p sl="de">On commissions, I can only echo what has already been said. It also seems to me to be a point in need of a little adjustment. However, this process is not so straightforward: tomorrow there will be further amendments proposed. Let us see what the result of that is.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the UK is home to over 36% of the EU’s wholesale finance market. It dominates Europe’s financial OTC trading and has a central role in foreign exchange and interbank money. These two reports represent an attack on that position. Such detailed micro-regulation can only drive up costs and make OTC products less attractive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s regulators, who now control these matters, know this perfectly well, and that is why they are doing it. Driving trading back onto the exchanges is the means by which the European Union asserts its control and limits both criticism and independence. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) report claims it wants to close loopholes. Its impact in the real world is likely to be the opposite. It forces traders to engage in an unceasing arms race with the regulators.</p>
      <p sl="en">Like water running downhill, trade moves to where it is most free. The EU’s ineptitude and parochialism, at the root of this approach to regulation, can only result in euro-sclerosis and euro-decline. Tragically, these reports are additional nails in the coffin of the City of London’s global position, and they have been deliberately engineered by Paris, Frankfurt and Berlin because they resent the City’s success.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Roger – Roger – Roger. I mean: please stop this! We did not quite hear ‘Thus spake Zarathustra’, but we did hear ‘Thus spake the City of London’. No – the reverse is true and important: MiFID I, MiFID II – these are abstract concepts that can be fleshed out. Many of us still remember how Commissioner McCreevy kowtowed to the corporate seats in London and explained how everything could be done through MiFID I. Now we see Mr Barnier and, hopefully, a majority here saying ‘never again!’ In the meantime something has happened. Is it EUR 2 or 3 billion that have been lost as a consequence of the opportunities afforded by under-regulation?</p>
      <p sl="de">Certainly, MiFID is a great step forward – there is no question of that – but there are still a few holes in it. As has already been mentioned, there are still far too many opportunities in the area of OTCs to escape into barely regulated trading venues, contrary to what the G20 specified. Every actor and every financial centre should be able to be controlled appropriately – we have not managed to do this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The commission issue was prioritised time and again by the Greens, but it is completely inexplicable to me how Social Democrats could end up with something like this. What interests are behind this? Naturally the basic problem of the incentive system remains. If we reward improper economic activities, we reap what we have indeed reaped. For all that, in the area of high-frequency trading we are on the right track – in general it is the right step – but it is still too little.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Ferber for both of his reports as they contain thorough and excellent work. It became clear during the crisis just how complex and completely untransparent certain financial activities and products have become. New commercial venues and products have appeared extremely quickly, while technological developments such as high-frequency algorithmic trading have also introduced changes into the financial services market. We as legislators have to respond to these in the interests of both citizens and the profession. This is why I welcome the fact that the proposed framework strengthens and harmonises the activities of investment enterprises in this direction as well as the powers of authorities supervising the markets of financial instruments. This also lays particular emphasis on cross-border cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is important that the supervisory authorities are capable of handling undesired market influences or even threats. In this respect I firmly support the strong role for the European Securities and Markets Authority as proposed within the framework. We must not forget the risk that high-frequency trading may imply for the liquidity or even efficiency of the financial markets – which is particularly relevant in crisis situations. For this reason I believe the changes that introduce proper organisational security mechanisms for trading locations are important.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the light of the problems experienced by SMEs recently in gaining access to finance, and assuming that such difficulties will re-emerge when the markets come under stress again, it is high time to establish trading locations that specialise in SME issues. I agree with Commissioner Barnier’s earlier statement that we have to make sure that the financial markets support the real economy, and not the other way round. My congratulations once more to the rapporteur, and I will vote in favour of the report too.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament will, in adopting Mr Ferber’s report, draw important lessons from MiFID I by adopting a text that ensures that almost all financial transactions will have to take place on regulated venues. That is the meaning we must give this text. High-frequency trading, a technique allowing a large number of orders to be executed in a few milliseconds, will now be highly constrained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The crisis has brought to light the abusive practices linked to the use of high-frequency trading by some financial players, disrupting the functioning of financial markets to obtain considerable profits. The position adopted by Parliament is a move in the right direction by discouraging use of this practice; it will help to put finance back where it belongs, that is to say, serving the real economy and long-term investment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this report, Parliament also wishes to tackle food speculation, which can be devastating for entire populations, by introducing position limits for the various players operating on trading venues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The destabilising effects of commodity speculation are increasingly clear, particularly on foodstuff markets. With this in mind, the proposals adopted today are a first step in the right direction, insofar as they impose limits on positions that may be taken by those operating on trading venues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report also allows us to take a significant step forward: the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be able to intervene to prohibit the sale of certain financial products acknowledged as toxic to the economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I would like to talk about an important point linking the discussion on MiFID I and the text we are going to adopt here. When considering MiFID I, Parliament’s main contribution concerned, the issue of advice that investors, particularly small investors, must be given when undertaking an investment. Financing conditions for such advice remain a point of discussion on which we must provide clarity to ensure that everyone, irrespective of income, may access such advice on terms that are transparent and actually enable them to invest on an informed basis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when the choice is between either ‘safe’ or ‘maybe it is ok’, we have to opt for ‘safe’. There has been a lot of publicity about commodity derivatives and food speculation; its position management has been too flexible. I have never had any problems with the notion of fixed position limits, as long as in emergencies they can be tightened if cornering happens or varied if a major market position has to be rescued. One day, I remind you again, we will have automated real-time transaction mapping, enabling much better interrogation of data without it being a drag on resources. It would also enable comprehensive, faster monitoring in crucial areas like food speculation, and that is why I pursue openness and FRAND licensing in standards and technology and regret that a little more has not been done in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Good work has been done on consumer protection, clamping down on inducements for giving advice to investors. Citizens need to be sure that they are getting the best advice for them, not being pushed in a direction for the adviser’s benefit. But ultimately a total ban has to be the way forward.</p>

      <p sl="es">The financial crisis has increased due to the existence of complex and strange transferable securities that are linked to derivative instruments and negotiations outside the official markets, with the aim of achieving high profits very quickly.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to attract financial transactions to a transparent market in order to guarantee good forming of prices and competition between transferable products.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly I want to thank Mr Ferber for his excellent work. It was not particularly easy, but it has turned out well in the end. The MiFID Financial Markets Directive is the basis for European financial market regulation and I am very happy that the European Parliament has taken such a clear, strong position through its revision of the MiFID Directive. Once again we are well ahead of the Council. The MiFID will improve the market structures, speed up trade, reduce systemic risk and, above all, reinforce the protection of investors. The European Securities and Markets Authority will also grow into its role. All in all this will make the financial markets a little safer.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like briefly to raise the issue of investment advice. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has voted clearly on this issue. Europe has many kinds of models for advice: commission-based advice, transferred commissions, fee-based advice – regardless of the model, each one has its advantages and disadvantages. The categorical condemnation of a specific model will get us nowhere. I also support the stance of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs calling for more openness and transparency but not banning any one model as such, since the quality of advice is not guaranteed when the advisor is only remunerated with a fee. There are certainly enough citizens who have been dissatisfied with the work of fee-based freelance advisers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps we should turn the debate on its head: what about financial education? An initiative for the study of economics and finance in schools and vocational colleges would certainly contribute to improved investor protection.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to thank Mr Ferber and the shadow rapporteurs for making substantial and innovative improvements to the Market and Financial Instruments Directive. But I want to focus in 90 seconds on two minor but highly significant areas where the citizens of Europe are demanding that we go further than the compromises that are on the table on investor protection and excessive speculation on the commodity markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Across Europe, consumers have been victims of the mis-selling of investment advice because of this perverse incentive in the commission inducement system which creates a bias towards products paying the highest level of commission and away from the best interests of the client or the investor. Studies by the German Institute of Consumer Policy show that disclosure and transparency do not work. There is clear evidence that consumers do not trust the independence of the advice if inducements are paid to push a particular product. So a ban is the only way to remove this conflict of interest and give strong protection to the investor.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many Member States – the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium – have recognised this and are in the process of introducing a ban. The option of a ban will not protect consumers. In fact this option is encouraging former investment bankers and Conservative Members of the UK Parliament to scrap the ban introduced by the Labour Government. I urge Members to support the ban that has been put down by myself, the Greens and several other groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">On excessive commodity speculation, let us end the situation and close the loophole whereby during the famine in the Horn of Africa, the World Food Programme paid EUR 50 million from UN aid to one large commodity trader, Glencore, for wheat it ordered to feed the poorest and hungriest population in the world. This is immoral and unjust. We should vote for Amendment 3 by the Greens, which I co-signed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say very quickly that I believe that Parliament is doing its job with the Commission – and soon, I hope, with the Council – in a difficult area, and to thank the rapporteur, who has done a very considerable amount of work with the shadow rapporteurs. It is an area where, in my view, one must be careful not to court public opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sometimes, outside, we are asked: what are you doing to regulate financial markets better?, and people underestimate what has been done. Nor must we give the idea that we are able, with a wave of a magic wand, to transform finance completely, to the extent required. A balance has been struck between transparency and optimum organisation. It is important to defend the rights of the consumer. There are still some slight differences of opinion between the above groups but, in any case, there is genuine agreement on saying that consumers must be better protected and also on protecting access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are, therefore, complex issues. We will continue working. In my view, Commissioner, it is a big job, which forms part of an even vaster whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, I also welcome the fact that the supervisory bodies, which we have helped to put in place together, are themselves also able to exercise more far-reaching competences in that area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, the MiFID II Directive, is a genuine milestone on the path to more efficient financial markets. Effective supervision must be established in order to ensure that all financial actors play by the rules. Quite rightly, the excellent report by Mr Ferber stipulates improved investor protection. We must prevent customers from exposing themselves to major risks through incorrect advice. Through provision of all the required information, they will be able to choose the most beneficial investment strategy for them. Products with a high factor of speculation must be clearly identifiable from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="de">Clearly, high-frequency trading must be more strictly regulated. We must put a stop to such transactions, which are carried out at the speed of sound and involve no business worth mentioning. The planned minimum holding periods of 500 milliseconds for orders are correct. They ensure that the continual placing and cancelling of orders will be limited to a minimum. If orders are cancelled before execution only in order to push prices higher, traders must be politely asked to pay up.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the compromise reached on position limits, i.e. on the maximum limit of high-risk financial contracts held. It enables speculation on raw materials, which is getting out of hand, to be channelled in a reasonable direction. There is no doubt that we need raw materials in order to supply our industries with the resources they need for production. What we absolutely do not need are bets that drastically push food and production prices higher. Clear limits must also be set here.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, back in 2009 the High Level Group on Financial Supervision chaired by Jacques de Larosière underlined the importance of stricter regulation of the financial system. Today, the compromise text on financial instruments represents an important step towards both greater transparency of high-frequency trading and the elimination of agricultural produce speculation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In July of this year we witnessed a 10 % rise in food prices, which was to a large extent caused by speculative activity. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has requested global coordination of efforts to tackle raw material speculation, underlining the harmful effects of this kind of behaviour on price volatility and stating that the latter has moved at an alarming pace since 2007.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, high-frequency trading, which unfortunately represents a significant component of the financial markets, has caused instability and serious losses to the European economy. In this context, I wish to express my support for a report which will make it possible to increase the transparency and efficiency of the financial markets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I seldom have the opportunity to praise Mr Ferber in a plenary session as highly as I can today, since he has done very good work. The compromise position he has produced, which has been accepted unanimously, is the result of multifaceted negotiations. Very well done.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have three points to make. The first is on the issue of position limits. The solution that has been found, which is obviously still being attacked from without, is the right way: we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater and make the negative side-effects for agricultural trade, which this solution certainly contains, responsible for world hunger. If we resolve position limits as Mr Ferber suggests, we are on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the compromise position on banning commissions, which was tabled at the last minute. As currently formulated, this could change the market considerably. As rapporteur for insurance mediation, I would preferred it if, in this position, this issue had been left to the Member States, since there are different systems. To write that commissions should be banned across the board goes too far for me, since it will entail a process of vertical concentration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, high-frequency trading: it has already been mentioned that there are many people in the sector who are against the compromise position. However, I think it is right that high-frequency trading should be slowed down, otherwise in the future computer systems and powerful computers will manipulate the financial market even more than before. Further work, which was not possible in MIFID, needs to be done on this, but the rapporteur will be able to achieve something more in the pending negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that shares losing almost their entire value in milliseconds, billions of dollars suddenly going up in smoke is not science fiction – unfortunately, this is the reality of today. Nowadays trading happens so fast that you cannot time it on a watch. The damage to national economies is huge. If we can still change something, we should try. Many citizens are sitting at home pondering the same question as I am: what possible economic benefit outweighs the huge risks of speculation? This development must be controlled as far as it is within our power to do so. This was one of the reasons for revising the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">The solutions put forward by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are minimum holding periods for trade, higher fees for too many cancelled orders, new capacity controls on the system and emergency provisions, e.g. the possibility of an EU-wide trading suspension. Through this planned legislation we will do something do curb these kinds of risks to the national economies.</p>
      <p sl="de">What about consumers? What do they actually get out of our regulations? The directive should not only control high-frequency trading but also protect private investors better in the future. What investor has not had the feeling that he or she is being pushed by his or her investment advisor towards a certain product which, in hindsight, is more beneficial to the advisor than to the customer? Hence my point that we must create more transparency: customers must be sufficiently and transparently informed about whether advice is given for remuneration and what fees are associated with it. Customers should in future receive a full account of costs and information on the entire spectrum of products. Furthermore, every product – old as well as new – should be examined each year to see if it is really in customers’ best interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">That brings us to the subject of commissions. According to the committee, commissions should only be allowed if they are passed on to customers, are necessary to supply the product (e.g. taxes) or if customers are informed of the fees. Member States may at present decide for themselves whether commissions are totally banned. We do not need to regulate this across the EU.</p>

Yet does this approach fulfil the expectations that the European Commission itself created when from 2008 on it admitted the end of derivatives themselves? In our view, it obviously does not. It is clear that the fight against financial speculation falls well short of what is needed and cannot be tackled partially. What would be socially and economically fair would be to declare all-out war on the speculation system itself, attacking not just the form, but also the content.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this regard, we must not conceal the heart of the matter. What we need is to call for an end to the derivatives market and tax havens and have truly effective control by politicians of the financial world. Everything that is being done here amounts to nothing more than placing a miniscule spanner in the works, which will fundamentally keep operating.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will come straight back to the comment just made by Ms Zuber.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Zuber, it is necessary to be objective; these are not partial responses made by the Commission, Parliament or the Council. We are dealing with every product, every sector, every financial player. For the more than two-and-a-half years during which I have had the honour to be Commissioner and to work with many of you, we have constructed – Ms Zuber, you have to look at things objectively – 28 texts under the heading of regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you put them together, as they are in this table, and explain matters to your constituents, it must give you the proof that we are dealing with the effects of, and learning the lessons from, the financial crisis, that we are doing the job. It is not just the Commission that is doing the job, but you, also, are doing the work as an MEP. Say it! You have reasons to be proud of the work done by all honourable Members on our proposals for learning from the crisis and, ultimately, doing what people expect, that is to say, making the financial markets, which we need – Ms Goulard was right to say so – serve the real economy once more, rather than themselves, as they have been allowed to do for 15 or 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say that because it is not something small, no tiny grain of sand, that Mr Ferber’s report offers you based on our proposal. Mr Krahmer, Ms Gáll-Pelcz and Ms Goulard indeed talked about the real economy. Your proposal, like the one I am presenting, pays great attention to the needs of the real economy and to small and medium-sized enterprises. Firstly, by putting in place financial markets which are healthy, transparent, efficient and useful in financing the real economy, to avoid what Mr Stolojan referred to as a problem in his own country, for instance, and to respond to the need for credibility, transparency and consumer and investor protection. At the same time, we are also taking specific measures on SME access to financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I would point out that, here in Europe, the economy is financed 75 % by the banks and 25 % by the financial markets. That is in inverse proportion to the United States, where it is the financial markets that finance 75 % of the economy. In Europe the figure is 25 %, and even less for small and medium-sized enterprises. I wish to state my intention to continue working on specific measures on financial market access for small and medium-sized enterprises, with carefully calibrated exemptions, in particular for industrial investment. I think of what we have done, for example, with Mr Langen for the European Market Infrastructure (EMIR) and what we are doing for SMEs with Mr Karas on banking regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Goebbels pointed out that this text has a review clause. It is also extremely important to remember that, for most of the texts I present to you, I support this idea of a review clause. In fact, as you said, Mr Goebbels, but also as pointed out by Mr Winkler, Ms Gáll-Pelcz and Ms Băsescu, we have to contend with highly effective and imaginative financial markets, which exploit not just technology but sometimes also loopholes in global regulation (and there are some) and which move very fast, much faster than us and much faster than democracy. That is why, as pointed out by Mr Goebbels, rendezvous clauses are needed to check, adapt and improve our texts.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would now like to say a word on a subject that is very important to me. You know that I was Minister for Agriculture in my country. I had the opportunity to give my opinion on what Ms Swinburne referred to, namely the growing financialisation of transactions on agricultural markets compared with physical markets. Such financialisation has increased exponentially over the last few years, with greater volatility in that area which naturally brings with it numerous additional speculation risks.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why, like Ms McCarthy, Mr Schmidt, Mr Klute, Mr Goebbels, Mr Langen, Ms Berès, Mr Mann and Mr Cutaş, I want to state my support for your rapporteur’s proposals, which you have supported unanimously, to further demonstrate – I am speaking now to Mr Giegold – that Commission proposals can always be, and often are, improved or strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not know everything; I do an honest, pro-active and generally ambitious job. Sometimes too much so, I am told, if I listen to certain lobbyists – but that is as much as I listen to them. I want to say that, happily, Parliament improves many texts. That is particularly true for this issue of position limits, where we see clearly that high-frequency trading must be constrained. I have not heard any proposals to prohibit high-frequency trading. I maintain, Mr Goebbels, that it has some benefit in terms of price formation but must be constrained and regulated. Certain abuses must be prevented.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is precisely what, together, we are going to propose. I will be looking very closely, for instance, at what happened in May 2010, at the time of the US crash. Indeed, what took place is still not very well understood, even two years later. Therefore, this principle of responsibility was needed and we will see, with the review clause, whether that is enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">In any case, echoing the remarks made by Ms Bowles, your Chair, I want to point out that the proposals you are preparing to approve in order to place very strict constraint on position limits – and I would very much welcome it if all other G20 partners, especially the United States, could confirm their determination to do the same – are backed – honourable Members, I am giving you this information – by IOSCO, the International Organization of Securities Commissions, which just stated in a report that this is the direction to take.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to respond, Mr President, if I may, to several of your colleagues – Mr Schmidt, Mr Balz, Mr Sosa Wagner, Mr Giegold, Ms Swinburne and Ms Berès – on the issue of commissions. We sought the right balance. Retrocession must be regulated and prohibited where necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, we provided for such a ban in two very specific instances: independent advice and portfolio management. In both cases, being remunerated by the provider of the products sold is, I think, wholly irreconcilable with an ability to provide the independent service the investor expects. I am conscious, honourable Members, of the changes that such a ban may entail in certain markets. That is why the Commission’s proposal retains the option for investors to take non-independent advice if they so wish.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I would point out that in another text, Packaged Retail Investment Products, PRIPs, we have also, and in parallel, strengthened and simplified the information available to all individual investors, in particular, and to which they are entitled.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Helmer pointed out the importance of the City of London. I think that the fact we have, in the City, such an important location for the financial markets is an opportunity, not just for the United Kingdom but for all of Europe, and I do not see, Mr Helmer, how the fact of strengthening transparency and promoting healthy markets, as MiFID seeks to do, could be seen as an attack on London. Or I have lost the plot!</p>
      <p sl="en">I have always thought and observed that those managing the City and the UK Exchequer supported the effort we are making together in favour of the single market in financial services, transparency and promotion of healthy markets. Please tell me if I am wrong, Mr Helmer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, Mr Helmer, an advocate of liberalism, will allow me to remind him – I am speaking from memory – of what was said by Adam Smith, the person who inspired great liberal thinking: ‘There is no market in the absence of rules and in the absence of moral conduct on the part of its own actors’. There is no market in the absence of rules, or in the absence of moral conduct, Mr Helmer, for actors in these financial markets. That is what we are in the process of restoring by learning the lessons from the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Martin, we are indeed in the process of learning the lessons from the crisis and also acting to ensure that account is taken of the will of the people, who no longer want to pay the costs of regulatory arbitrage and a certain irresponsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">All in all, honourable Members, we need financial markets – I reiterate what Ms Goulard said, we need markets which are secure, transparent and perhaps, in the home stretch, Mr Ferber, we will be able to look at whether, in the detail, we have indeed closed all the loopholes to leave the least possible opportunity for regulatory arbitrage and be certain, in terms of all the details, that this requirement for transparency, but also traceability, is indeed present.</p>
      <p sl="en">That has been our goal with Mr Langen for the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) text and, lastly, I would like to say a word of thanks to Ms McCarthy for the work she did on the report just adopted on another directive forming part of this set on sanctions, including criminal and administrative sanctions for market abuse.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, we are working for the real economy. We want to make financial markets serve the real economy once more and, in all the texts we are working on together – MiFID today – capital requirements for solvency, pension funds, we must have this concern for the real economy and long-term investment. That is also why I am going to start a debate by means of a green paper not only on how to avoid penalising long-term investment and the real economy but also to on how to encourage them. I would, moreover, from that angle, support Mr Balz’s proposal on financial education, which is a very important point and one we should develop in various ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I would like to say that your unanimous expression of thanks to Mr Ferber, your rapporteur, is well deserved, given the complexity of this text, which is a cornerstone of this regulatory agenda. To your thanks, I would like to add my own, and add that we are ready to complete the home stretch in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief. Firstly, I am pleased that I have such wide support, from the extreme left to the extreme right. I do not know whether this is a good thing – but perhaps it is helpful to have found a compromise in the middle.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I want to point out here that we are talking about financial market regulation. Therefore, it depends on which markets trading takes place on. Trading in financial products always involves risk: there is no such thing as a risk-free financial market. If you demonise financial markets per se, you will be unhappy with any regulation. This was not our intention. It was our intention, on the one hand, to ensure that every trade in financial products takes place within a regulated framework and, on the other hand, that these financial markets generate added value for the economy and do not exist purely for their own sake. If we have anything to learn from the time before 2008 it is that financial markets acted independently and did not generate any added value for the real economy – this has been the painful experience of recent years. As a result, we have produced something together.</p>
      <p sl="de">My heartfelt thanks, therefore, go to all the shadow rapporteurs who collaborated on this report. We will have the privilege of holding meetings with the Council over the coming months in order to produce a good result. I hope that we can take the good spirit we have maintained in discussions over almost a year into those negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report today is an assessment of what is now a significant part of European economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the group rapporteurs, with whom I was able − and this is not just words − to undertake genuine constructive work. I believe that this report, taken overall, reflects the concerns of everyone, even if not all have been taken up in a strict sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report was also undertaken in close cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in accordance with Rule 50, which explains why the report takes up a number of provisions in their entirety, without a vote, so as to properly respect those rules and the ideas of that committee; the rules prevailed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not going to list the various points we are emphasising in terms of the Semester content; I would rather talk about what concerned us the most, namely the method. The Semester is, as I was saying, a very important element in establishing coordination of States’ economic and financial policies and involves both European and national levels. That is already something new.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, while the Commission’s proposals must next be validated by the Council before being reflected, as far as possible, in national budgets, there is a need, in terms of democratic control, for sound understanding and proper coordination with national parliaments. In this regard, we know − and I do not think anyone will mind me saying − that some of our national parliaments do not fully understand Community Mechanisms and there is a certain apprehension when they see the European level take precedence over national level. That is why some, quite legitimately, assert that national sovereignty entitles them to adopt the budget they want and that they do not have to obey instructions or orders from elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is, therefore, undoubtedly work to be done to educate and explain. Indeed, a meeting was recently held in Brussels with the representatives of the financial or economic committees of the national parliaments to explain this European Semester. I had the opportunity, as rapporteur, to say that MEPs have no intention whatsoever of interfering in national relations or the working of national parliaments and that, in reality, the European Parliament and national parliaments have a specific task, that of providing democratic control at their level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that in future such meetings will have to be repeated to encourage understanding of the system and its proper application. In this regard, it would certainly be a good thing for these meetings, currently organised in a fairly ad hoc way, to be more formal and, in particular, for those attending the meetings to be able to do so regularly, so that genuine dialogue may be established between national parliaments and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">On issues of method, we also stress the need, for instance, for recommendations to be more explicit so that outcomes may be evaluated and, if necessary, corrected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I will add that it is also important for States to meet the commitments they have themselves made. It seems an obvious thing to say but, unfortunately, the opposite is often seen.</p>

    <intervention id="4-390-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Karel De Gucht" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Jean-Paul Gauzès, and the other Members involved, including those from the associated committees, for their work on this report and the result that came out of that work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is pleased by Parliament’s endorsement of the 2012 European Semester and the support for its growth-enhancing policies and its policies aimed at correcting macroeconomic imbalances. The Commission equally welcomes the call for Member States to strictly follow the rules set by the Stability and Growth Pact and for all parties involved to speedily agree on the Two-Pack.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, the Commission has taken careful note of the suggestions made in the report for improving the European Semester process, for example regarding the content and focus of the Annual Growth Survey priorities, including the role of the EU budget and the single market. The Commission will issue the new Annual Growth Survey at the end of November 2012, together with the alert mechanism report and Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011. Allow me to go into some more detail with regard to the positions expressed in the report in three areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the report calls on the Commission to review its current approach and to issue only one recommendation to Member States in the financial assistance programme in order to bring it more into line with the Europe 2020 objectives. I would like to recall that the adjustment programmes already touch on areas covered by Europe 2020. The economic adjustment programmes include important growth-enhancing structural reforms covering the most urgent issues in the respective Member States’ economies. The Commission has deliberately decided to issue one single, country-specific recommendation for programme countries, asking them to implement the measures as laid down in the respective programmes. Therefore all efforts should concentrate on programme implementation, which covers the most urgent priorities for the countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the report calls on the Commission to present a framework regulation specifying the role – including timelines – of the Member States and the EU institutions at the various stages of the semester cycle. However, whether a new legislative proposal in this area is opportune can only be assessed once the results of the currently ongoing negotiations on the Two-Pack are completed and the debate on the future of EMU has sufficiently advanced.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the report calls for strengthening the democratic legitimacy of EU economic governance. The Commission supports the strong involvement of the European Parliament in the reinforced European Semester and the active role of the European Parliament in the new economic dialogue. The possibility for Parliament, introduced by the Six-Pack, to conduct economic dialogues with individual Member States provides an important element for a transparent process of democratic accountability in European economic governance. The Commission encourages the European Parliament to continue taking the economic dialogue forward with the other institutions and with individual Member States, as foreseen in the Six-Pack.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, among the numerous challenges that the introduction of the European Semester presents, I would like to mention two key aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, this mechanism must not simply be an instrument for formal surveillance of budgetary policies between Member States and by the Commission. On the contrary, the European Semester must allow sincere and in-depth collaboration between the European Parliament and national parliaments, in keeping with our respective competences and the democratic principle. It is the only valid way forward with a view to complementarity of national budgetary policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, with regard to the European budget: our Parliament, by a massive vote in favour of the Kalfin and Böge report, pointed out that 94 % of this budget was an investment budget. On that basis, I proposed, in my opinion included in the report, exploring the possibility of excluding Member States’ contributions to the EU budget from the calculation of the structural deficit, as defined in the two-pack, the six-pack and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG).</p>
      <p sl="en">Our Parliament is conducting the mother of all battles, for a European budget that meets the overall interests of the EU and its citizens. That is the direction of this proposal, addressed both to net contributory and beneficiary States. It would free up budget negotiation. In fact, it would make it possible to leave behind the damaging logic of fair return and the search for rebates and move to an approach based on contribution in the noblest sense of the term. In addition, such a calculation method would make the most of all payments to our common budget, including those made by beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consequently, I ask Mr Gauzès, our rapporteur, to look again at his request, on behalf of the PPE, to remove this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think the second Semester was an improvement on the first. When I started working as a rapporteur on the Semester, around this time last year, there was hardly any debate at all about job creation or recovery. It was all financial figures and economic variables then. This has changed for the better, but although the debate seems to have shifted in the right direction, the actions have not yet shifted.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the leaders of the Member States cheerfully announced in January that they would all come up with job plans, none of them did. While lip service is paid to alleviating poverty, the number of poor in Europe has risen sharply. And while everybody expresses their grave and graver concern over rising youth unemployment, they stop short of a binding Youth Guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the next Semester, in 2013, I want to see the Commission and the Council address rising unemployment and rising poverty much more seriously: for instance, through that binding Youth Guarantee; through the assessment of economic measures for their effect on the poorest and most vulnerable people; through an approach to wages that addresses them not merely as an economic variable, but as the money out of which people pay for their food and the roof over their heads.</p>
      <p sl="en">I deplore the fact that, although the Semester is becoming more and more important, it is not becoming more democratic. At the moment, we as a parliament can do no more than give friendly advice. This makes it particularly vital that there should be a strong majority for this report tomorrow if we want our advice to be heard, because only with a strong majority will there be a moral incentive for the Commission and the Council to take the recommendations on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">One sentence threatens that majority. It is in paragraph 23 on the Fiscal Compact. I would appeal strongly to colleagues on the left and the right in this Parliament to vote in favour of the identical amendments 1 and 14 to change this sentence, regardless of your opinion on the Fiscal Compact, because this report is not about that. This report is not the place to settle our differences on the Fiscal Compact, it is about the European Semester. The text of the amendments neither applauds nor criticises the Compact and it should be capable of uniting us as a parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I especially appeal to my fellow rapporteur, Mr Gauzès to please not allow this sentence, which is unnecessary for his report, and not to poison the otherwise strong and good message we are sending out.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is my first opportunity, as chair of the committee, to contribute to the debate on the European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank Jean-Paul Gauzès very much for accepting quite a number of the points my committee made. I was also pleased that Commissioner De Gucht mentioned the issues around the importance of the single market in underpinning future growth and dynamism in European economies in the context of the broader consideration of policies within the European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly the single market is somewhat different from the coordination of individual Member States’ budgetary policy, because it is a combined policy framework for the Commission and Member States, within which the Commission clearly has important responsibilities. It is important that the Commission and the Member States be called to account jointly in that process. However, as a committee, we feel from our experience since 1999 that now we have a Single Market Act in place – which has set down very clear, specific commitments about action not just to introduce or reform legislation at European level but also to enforce and implement the policies at Member State level – there is time to consider how to incorporate this more formally into the Semester process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have our own governance processes, such as internal market scoreboards, which clearly ought not to operate in isolation. We have some new ideas here which I am pleased that the rapporteur has picked up. We are doing our own report on single market governance, which will link into this, but I hope that over the next 12 months we may make some serious progress on integrating our thoughts about the single market into the broader strategy for growth and dynamism in the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, so these points are also included in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we want to strengthen the European Semester we have to endow it with more democratic legitimacy. We need to clear up the remaining legal ambiguities which may give rise to institutional conflicts, increased complexity of the system, or duplication of competences.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament, which is the only supranational institution with electoral legitimacy, should be involved in economic policy coordination. We should be able to evaluate the whole process, be involved in the follow-up to the annual growth survey and the country-specific recommendations. But we should not do it alone. We must involve the national parliaments and cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments must be strengthened. However, we do not need to reinvent the wheel and can do this on the basis of the Lisbon Treaty and Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Incidentally, the proposal from the Polish Government that addresses the question goes in the right direction. If we are to succeed, we have to involve directly-elected institutions in the whole process.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first and foremost to thank the rapporteur for having taken on board all – or most – of the points in the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am Vice-Chair.</p>
      <p sl="it">Economic crises compromise efforts made towards gender equality: the employment rate among women falls ever lower and the gender pay gap grows ever wider. The contractual safeguards for many women and mothers are still precarious and the number of women in leadership positions and in the political, science and technology sectors is low. Adequate funding for EU programmes is necessary to reduce the gender pay gap and encourage access for women to highly skilled jobs.</p>
      <p sl="it">An increase in the labour market participation of women would free an important amount of talent that has remained untapped for many years. In the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we proposed uniform formats for women’s integration, and above all specific measures targeting vulnerable groups of women.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important that we as the European Parliament grapple very hard with the European Semester – after all, we introduced it when we negotiated the ‘six-pack’. Why? I believe that we in Europe have not been suffering from formulating the rules of the game together but rather we are suffering from the fact that, in the end, the rules are not being applied as they were formulated at the European level. Parliament ought to lead this process very strongly and also to continue to touch on the sore points where things are not working as agreed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that the report before us – for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, in particular – provides an important indicator of what can be improved in the interaction between Member States, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the Commission, which must oversee the whole procedure, and the processes that then take place in the Member States. We must now cooperate to use all the euphoria, the spirit of optimism – that is right, we want to make things better for the future – and this momentum, if we want Europe to learn lasting lessons from the financial, economic and national debt crisis. There are many, many important contributions here, both in the individual reports from the Commission to the Member States and in the work we at Parliament have produced.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many thanks to the rapporteur for this. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) emphatically supports this report. However, over the coming weeks, months and years we will ensure not only that many documents are written but that policy is implemented in the interests of European citizens and taxpayers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gauzès report, together with the report we will be drafting at the end of the year on the Union’s annual growth prospects, which will arrive before the Spring Council, are two key parts of the ‘European Semester’. This report examines the recommendations made to each of the Member States by the Council on a proposal by the Commission, and these recommendations fit in, as has just been said, with the Six-Pack and the future Two-Pack, an extraordinarily robust corpus, which bolsters European control of Member States’ economic and budgetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is not easy to strike a balance between this control and autonomy and legitimacy at national level and the bar has slipped to a level of imposition, of discipline especially and, ultimately, can even lead to a serious package of sanctions. As regards the Two-Pack, I would like to say briefly that it is important that the Council, which is not represented here today, give a negotiating mandate to its negotiators that reflects the ambition to wrap up this package, the Two-Pack, speedily. However, getting back to the subject, more European coordination means countries have less control of their own fate, which means there has to be a subtle balancing act yet also an increased demand for quality in the recommendations made to countries in at least three or four areas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, it is important to ensure consistency between medium and long-term objectives that include growth, employment and real convergence and short-term recommendations focusing above all on discipline and nominal convergence; secondly, there needs to be coherence with the conclusions that need to be drawn from the analysis of macroeconomic imbalances, in particular the asymmetrical impact of common policies and negative externalities, the indirect effects of certain national policies on other countries; thirdly, we need to agree that there is a minimum threshold for social, economic and working rights that these recommendations must not cross and, lastly, it is imperative that the quality of the recommendations be measured by the results obtained, which is far from being the case up to now.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I will finish now, Mr President, but I would just like to thank Mr Gauzès for his spirit of cooperation and I hope he is able to take another step further in this spirit so that the consensus around his report can be extended and that this spirit also stretches to the next report we are going to discuss.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all my thanks to the rapporteur and to colleagues who worked on this topic, since it is very simple and very complicated at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thinking about it, it is very simple; that is to say, it has taken 20 years, since signature of the Treaty of Maastricht, to realise that there might be a need to engage in some discussion with national parliaments. In principle, it is not such an extraordinary idea that, having a common currency, it would perhaps be better, when we are producing the budgets, to try to talk a little, have an exchange and ensure that the European level and the national level cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From another angle, it is very complicated, since there is a lot of sensitivity around a certain idea of sovereignty, which, although it is already shared, some consider a pure and perfect form. I find, therefore, that Mr Gauzès has done a very good job.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What concerns me – as has just been said – is how, when it comes down to it, what is written on paper will be translated into reality. How, over the years, are we going to manage to introduce real content, so that cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament is not discussion, which is useful, but genuine control by national parliaments of what is theirs to control at their level, and control at European level of what we must control and, ultimately, a policy which is better for ordinary people and for currency stability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is a milestone on a journey on which, in my opinion, there is still a long way to go.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to speak. And thank you to the rapporteur for a superb report. I think that this has been an excellent result, particularly when considered as a whole, with input from all of the various political groups too. In the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance we feel that the Semester is a significant opportunity for Europe to create genuine coordination of our financial policies. We may perhaps also have to admit that we have not yet achieved genuine coordination. We have perhaps instead a number of somewhat random recommendations, which may to a large extent be based on what the Member States were already doing beforehand. I believe we will get to the stage where we are using this as an appropriate tool to also compensate for some of the imbalances that are making the crisis even deeper than it is already.</p>
      <p sl="da">The other thing we are very concerned about is that EU2020 is taken as seriously as our goal in respect of budget discipline. It must be taken as seriously as getting people into work, tackling poverty and safeguarding the environment. If we do not take it seriously, we will lose the stepping stones to our own future; we will lose our stepping stones to tomorrow, which is something that we cannot afford in Europe. I believe we must live by the principle of having the best-educated citizens, most people in work and the strongest environment. I believe this is the key to competitiveness. I do not believe we can achieve healthy public finances unless we govern ourselves in accordance with the EU2020 goals. I believe these are important goals; they point towards a good future for Europe, and we have no choice but to admit that the crisis is now so deep that it is threatening the very existence of our 2020 plan. Things are actually heading in the wrong direction for many of the goals, and I believe it is important that we take up these recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="da">That said, I would like to point out that there are many good points in this report. Thank you to the rapporteur for including them. We have placed particular emphasis on the 2020 references specifically, on strengthening the European Parliament’s role and on the inclusion of the social partners and civil society. It is important that we also consider tax evasion, and that we consider not only the deficit countries but also the surplus countries. These are a few of the crucial points that have been raised – thanks again to the rapporteur. It appears we have found the necessary flexibility to also achieve a joint vote tomorrow. And I would like to acknowledge this. Thank you!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in principle I support the European Semester, to keep national budgets in control and prevent budget derailing as we have seen over the past years. A monetary union without fiscal discipline will explode. Country-specific recommendations make sense but add little new. The IMF and the OECD have been making the same recommendations for years. It is like a severely overweight person visiting the doctor. His doctor will tell him ‘you have to lose weight’, but obviously the patient knows this already. The remedy looks very simple – exercise up, calories down, but you have to do it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States are also recommended to do things they already know and when this is not the case they simply ignore it and live in denial. The number one recommendation for France is that people should work longer, but the first thing Mr Hollande did was to cut the retirement age. Likewise, it remains to be seen if France will take orders from Brussels on budgetary policy. French public opinion is mainly in denial about the oversized welfare state. When public sector unions are confronted with facts they start striking and the political leadership of France does little to raise the much-needed awareness.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the economic dialogue, I would like to remind Parliament of the exchange of views we had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) with the Finance Minister of Belgium, Mr Vanackere. He painted a very rosy picture of the Belgian economy. He depicted the Belgian economy as a rose garden. A few weeks later it turned out that he had used overly optimistic figures in his presentation. Instead of being a top performer, Belgium is heading towards recession. Its economy is shrinking at a much higher pace than the eurozone average. Serious budget cuts are needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The economic dialogue with Belgium was no more than a good news show intended for domestic consumption. The value of such exchange is rather limited. Those who live in denial are punished by the facts later on, as was the case with Mr Vanackere, so the proposed form of the European Semester is an exercise in irrelevance. Forecasts are far too rosy year after year. The Commission wants to spread optimism but predicted growth is often followed by even more contraction. A European semester only works when we stop fooling ourselves, face reality as it is, and act accordingly.</p>

All the same, I would like to give him the chance to correct what he said with regard to the latest International Monetary Fund observations, because, on reading carefully – as you clearly have not – what the IMF says about the European situation it is exactly the opposite of what you said. In fact, the IMF tells us that the policies currently being followed will lead to more austerity, something which, moreover, can be seen by any person who is intellectually honest – clearly, still not the case with you – in certain countries where extremely harsh prescriptions have been applied under the authority of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer . – Mr President, I will be very brief. I was referring to the report by the Commission. The IMF is much more realistic about what is going on, but the Commission wants to spread optimism, hoping that all the troubles will go away by themselves. As Members know, that is not the case. The Commission is doing this because it is afraid that public opinion will get demoralised, and so the process becomes increasingly messy. That is the wrong basis for doing things. It is better to stick to the facts.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has already been said about the European Semester but I should like to ask you some very upfront questions. We all know that the Treaties set limits on trade surpluses, we are also all aware that Germany does not stick to them. That is a fact. There is no shortage of recommendations from the European Commission in this regard and Germany does not respect the recommendations. To be honest, I cannot hear anyone here saying a word about this. What I am wondering is: where are the sanctions? On the other hand, it is being suggested that it is perfectly natural to apply sanctions to countries that do not meet the targets laid down in the Treaties for deficits and debt. Seemingly everyone agrees on this. The thing is, everyone is really tough on the weak but very weak on the strong ones. While no sanctions are applied to countries that have trade surpluses for violating the Treaties, and I think we agree that these countries are in a better condition to pay them because the violation is for accumulating surpluses, I think it is immoral that it is taken for granted that countries in violation because they have accumulated deficits should automatically be made to pay, especially when they have difficulties paying for this very reason. This is not democratic.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Even as regards keeping to the deficit and debt targets, the same rule does not apply to everyone, as we well know that it kicks in immediately for countries under Troika intervention, but the same does not hold true for countries in the centre or north of Europe that do not meet the same criteria. This is not democratic! Lastly, it will only be when we manage to incorporate some justice in all of this that we will achieve the true economic coordination that we so need. Until then, we will continue to focus more on applying measures that are based exclusively on budget cuts, the privatisation of public services and brazen tax hikes, this is the recipe, in a nutshell, and I am finishing now Mr President, this is the recipe in a nutshell that is being applied to the budgets of the countries under intervention. The European Semester is, for these citizens, synonymous with injustice and poverty. In Portugal, just in one European Semester, we have managed to slip decades in terms of rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, whether it agrees or not, the European Commission has contributed to the crisis by distributing the European budget without exercising proper controls. Also, through multiple directives, it has imposed a huge burden of regulation on Member States, forcing prohibitive costs on private entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="en">How can the same institution which has failed so gravely make judgments on where and how Member States need to put their taxpayers’ money? SMEs are the backbone of economic expansion and recovery. But by urging the Member States to create access to finance for SMEs, we will achieve nothing, as their coffers are now empty. Why not use the bank bailout money to help SMEs instead of helping failed banks? Why not look for more flexible measures instead of calling for the inclusion of a core set of rights in workers’ contracts? The Commission has not learnt any lessons from the past.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Semester is only the first stage of national budget oversight, since it is not the only procedure. There are also the Treaties, the Protocol on Excessive Deficits, the Euro Plus Pact and, in your inimitable jargon, the six-pack and the two-pack. There is the Budgetary Treaty, a classic international agreement, which even this Parliament, not so long ago, considered useless and redundant. Different, even contradictory, target figures, different areas of application and texts of different legal natures, in which one part contradicts the provisions of the Treaty itself. In such circumstances, it is euphemistic to talk about legal ambiguity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ultimate aim of this labyrinthine effort is, itself, genuinely unique. Using the crisis as a pretext, it is to strengthen the powers of the European superstate by giving the Commission the right to monitor and dictate not just the level of public deficits but also the level of budgets and the detail of policies. The country-specific recommendations which you wish to beef up, the commitments in the context of Euro Plus, are all steps in the same direction: frozen or reduced wages, easier dismissals, deregulation of protected professions, increased competition in all sectors, dismantling of social protection systems; the room for manoeuvre which States have is derisory, as demonstrated by the pitiful pseudo-transfer of political power that has just taken place in France.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am addressing the House with the simple aim of highlighting the importance of the European Semester as a tool for detecting the weaknesses in our system and for exercising the democratic legitimacy that Parliament represents.</p>
      <p sl="es">Following the beginning of the crisis, and thanks to the implementation of these mechanisms, we are succeeding in analysing its causes in order to lay the foundations for greater EU integration, which is the only response and the only option for bringing an end to the crisis and ensuring that this type of crisis cannot happen again.</p>
      <p sl="es">The semester represents the desire for coordination that we have been so much lacking so far in order to jointly manage our needs as Europeans. The tools related to the European Semester, the Annual Growth Survey and the Country-Specific Recommendations create greater stability for all Member States and deepen their knowledge. The report, presented by Mr Gauzès, which is the result of very hard work, reflects their value.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, we must continue to promote greater coordination between our policies until we create not only true economic union, but true political union. This does not mean that agreements do not have to be fulfilled, but must be a further incentive for the EU to speak with once voice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, could you tell Commissioners Rehn and Andor that this Parliament takes the European Semester procedure seriously?</p>
      <p sl="fr">To that end, when, on 28 November, the Commission puts on the table the annual growth review, which will serve as our underlying thread for 2013, we would like them to have several messages in mind. Firstly, to take account of the Growth Pact called for by the Heads of State or Government, on 28 and 29 June; next, the lessons from what the International Monetary Fund tells us, namely that a roadmap based only on austerity clearly has no chance of getting the European Union moving again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we think that the purpose of having an annual growth review and a definition of a European vision worked out before the European Council is to gain the means not simply to condemn each Member State in relation to its budgetary policy but also to draw up a common roadmap, enabling us, for instance, to correct macroeconomic imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Please tell your colleagues that we would like two important things. The first is the possibility for Parliament to be involved in defining this European roadmap. For that we need a document we are able to amend, even though, formally, we do not currently have powers of codecision. Then, if the Member States are required, alongside national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes, to submit national programmes for jobs, these documents must then be taken seriously. Member States that do not take them seriously must be penalised or, at least, called on to do so with a vigilance not shown by Mr Rehn this year.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer . – Mr President, clearly, Mr Eppink thinks it necessary to play tit for tat and I would willingly tell him that he should know the French situation better and that, clearly, the rules that apply here do not necessarily do so elsewhere. In particular, the country from which I come and which you undoubtedly do not know as well as I do, is one where the demographic situation is nothing like that seen in other European countries, which makes it possible, in a difficult climate in which the President of the French Republic is seeking to re-establish conditions for a fruitful social dialogue to conduct reform, to have a mandate based on a decision imposed in relation to the record of his predecessor.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, last July the Member States received a package of recommendations to put and keep their national finances in order. It is to be hoped that these recommendations will persuade European governments to implement the necessary reforms. The financial and economic situation in Europe is indeed very serious. The figures on the increasing debt burden and the lack of competitiveness in large parts of Europe speak for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is important to emphasise that we are dealing here with a package of recommendations and not with obligations. After all, in Europe we have always made agreements in the Stability and Growth Pact about debt reduction and medium-term objectives. How these objectives are achieved will be determined by the Member States themselves. And the national parliaments will carry out the democratic control on specific measures.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Although some people here would also willingly take on this role of the national parliaments, the European Parliament cannot fulfil this role. It does not have the legal capacity or competence. As far as my country, the Netherlands, is concerned, the negotiators for the new cabinet would do well to follow the recommendations of the Council issued in July. The accelerated increase in pensionable age to 67 and the limitation of mortgage interest relief are greatly needed to ensure that public finances are also bearable in the long term. I really hope that Mr Rutte and Mr Samson will be able to make these choices.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the kernel of this issue lies in the title of this report, in the word ‘coordination’. In theory I would not be against measures aimed at maintaining equilibrium between the Member States’ economic policies since, in our hastily and poorly-constructed Europe, a deficit in one country has direct spill-over effects on the others. However, I cannot see how this type of coordination can develop. I am afraid that this amounts to the imposition of a common policy decided by Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are too many signs that this is the case, and I do not believe that the way out of the crisis is to give up control of fiscal policy too. The countries that were unlucky enough to join the euro have already lost all their monetary independence and I do not believe it is right to take this last shred of sovereignty away from them too. As far back as 1998, Umberto Bossi, the founder of my party, said that we would reach the point of having financial legislation faxed directly from Brussels. Events are unfortunately proving him right. We cannot and certainly do not want to continue being complicit in all this.</p>

In the Member States the Commission is at present the boss, thanks also to the European Parliament. But we can all see in our own countries that unemployment is too high or the government deficit is too great or the legislation too strict. We do not need the Commission for that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it does not seem possible to have a monetary union for economies that operate at different speeds. The euro zone is persistently unstable. But the North does not wish to continue to pay for the South and the South does not wish to be ordered around by the Commission. What the Commission should propose is that the euro zone be dissolved, because the South must urgently be released from the straitjacket of the euro.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I congratulate Mr Gauzès for his excellent work on the report on the European Semester. I know much of Parliament agrees with me. There are, of course, criticisms but criticism is part of debate, democracy and argument. I think this is the moment in the debate where we should look at whether we can put some of these criticisms to bed.</p>
      <p sl="it">So far we have talked about the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’, and about the European Semester, which is part of this type of system. I firmly believe, however, that Mr Gauzès has picked up on some of the grey areas of the European Semester. We need to look more closely at these grey areas with the Commission, but we must approach this without any preconceived ideas.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main thing, I think, is that the Commission should make recommendations that take account of the specific characteristics of each Member State and the different points they are starting from. I strongly support what the report says about the content of recommendations. It is very often the case – and there is nothing wrong with saying this – that these focus on a small number of areas that need to be improved. Then there is the issue of greater compliance with recommendations, which should also be dealt with by the Commission, and the problem of Europe 2020 and the problem of growth. Better and more obvious backing should be given to European businesses, which are the backbone of our economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, there is still a great deal of scope for improving coordination and making it more effective, leaving aside any ideological issues and political stances. I do agree that the Council, the Commission, and the Member States should make a serious effort to improve the Semester, because this is the real issue that comes out of both the debate and the report. This is the only way we will come anywhere near achieving true economic union in Europe. This is one school of thought, but I will not be surprised in the least if there are people who think otherwise.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, at this point when the whole process of the European Semester is already taking place, we must be capable of sufficiently in-depth reflection to transfer experiences into good practice and also to discontinue bad practices. Some things are still missing in this process and I would like to set out three items that seem really important to me and which will need to be worked on a little more and have a little more time spent on them.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Firstly, I think that an in-depth approach is missing. We cannot allow the same Council recommendations to be transferred literally to individual Member States, as we found out a long time ago that ‘one size fits all’ does not work in European policy. Recommendations should be more detailed and present a true assessment of conditions in the relevant Member State.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We also need a commitment from Member States that within the European Semester they will put forward national plans for jobs, above all jobs for young people. The European Youth Guarantee scheme is an excellent example and a binding mechanism to improve the position of young people in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Secondly, I think that a greater presence of the Europe 2020 strategy is missing. This has already been noted several times today, so I shall repeat it too. The inclusion of the Europe 2020 should mean that both the problem of youth unemployment and the significant problem of poverty are included in the recommendations for individual countries.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Thirdly, greater adaptability is missing. It is extremely important that during the Semester the Commission allows the possibility of adapting individual recommendations when they prove unsuitable for meeting amended targets.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Last but not least, the Semester is still lacking in democratic legitimacy. The voice of the European Parliament, the only elected supranational institution, must at least come closer to that of the Commission and the Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Gauzès for his work on this important report. Good use of the European Semester could be a valuable aid to budgetary surveillance. The Semester is very useful for Member States that want to strengthen fiscal and monetary union. The country-specific recommendations for the United Kingdom highlight the difficult but necessary measures taken by the British Government. These measures have corrected 10 years of waste by the previous Labour Government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission fully supports the budgetary consolidation implemented by the United Kingdom. It recognises the importance of the apprenticeship programmes put in place to combat youth unemployment. Lastly, it approves of the reforms we are making in the banking sector.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Regulation of November 2011 gave the European Commission new powers to coordinate budgets and reform programmes of the Member States of the Union. At the same time, this Regulation imposed the obligation on Member States to send, in addition to the draft national budget, a number of other documents related to the implementation of economic reforms in their countries to Brussels for review and approval.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that as this new instrument for coordinating Member States’ economic policies has been in place for one year, the Commission should review the scope and structure and nature of the data forwarded to Brussels by the Member States for review and approval so that the essence of the required information is not lost as a result of the large number of diverse and non-transparent data. If, however, the Commission wishes to develop a truly high-quality European macroeconomic plan as the basis for the substantive coordination of budgetary policies, it should have correctly selected information available to it from all 27 EU Member States using a clear and meaningful structure. I therefore firmly believe that the simplification and clarification of the information base of this instrument would only increase its effectiveness.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is important to recognise that there are no stronger arguments for reform than in those Member States that have lost competitiveness and in those economic sectors that lack competitiveness. That reform can never be forced upon Member States, but there must be an understanding that reform is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Increased deficits or increased spending or – referring to the debate we have had – a lower pension age do not solve any problems. We have seen, on the other hand, that the deficits and debt burdens are undermining not only public finances but also the competitiveness of EU Member States. It is important to state that we do have a common commitment to making the reforms which are needed, but these must be based on political will and democratic support in each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think we, from the European Union, should regulate labour markets, because that must be left up to the different Member States. However, I do think we need to ensure, and place emphasis on, a commitment to reforms which can guarantee that we have a functioning and dynamic single market that turns the world’s biggest economy into the world’s biggest and most dynamic market. This underscores the need for reforms to the single market to be accompanied by market reforms in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like us to have a horizontal approach regarding the single market and market reforms, but also a vertical one, in each Member State. This will facilitate, and ensure there is an opening-up to more competition, more plurality and more competitiveness. That should be the next step forward in the European Semester – or whatever it is to be called – in the future. In order to do this we will need a commitment to making our European economies more competitive, and that is the task for us.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gauzès: thank you for your report. We are debating it in the fifth year of an economic crisis that has resulted in 25 million unemployed and 115 million people at risk of social exclusion: the responsibility and efficiency of the European Union are in question.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Semester is a key tool for strengthening European economic governance and ensuring that economic policies within the EU are drawn up as a matter of common interest. Its full implementation confirms that it is a positive process, but it is still far from achieving its full potential. In order for it to progress further, we need a genuine framework for European economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Annual Growth Survey must establish a macroeconomic scenario with quantifiable targets in terms of growth, job creation and investment that contribute to competitiveness, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy targets. Multilateral surveillance must become genuine economic coordination; there must be an EU approach to establishing recommendations – which must be more explicit and detailed – that take into account the diversity of situations, the interactions and spill-over effects between Member States, and the added value that joint measures can bring. It is only with a joint perspective that we will be able to mobilise all our resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">The semester cannot be a bureaucratic procedure, but instead must be a democratic process. Economic, budgetary and social policies require transparency, participation from civil society and consensus. We need to ensure full democratic control in real time by the European Parliament and the national parliaments. In addition, we need to make further institutional changes.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to move from muses to the theatre, from literature to budgets, programmes and reality, we are going to need to optimise our fiscal resources and have a multi-level framework for budgetary action in all aspects of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr Gauzès on his report and his commitment to the issue of economic governance in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report we are discussing today is the first complete survey of the European Semester, and the conclusions we are gathering are therefore very important for its future implementation. The European Semester is now proving to be an excellent tool for coordinating our policy objectives and responsibilities at European and national level. The crisis has shown up the significant differences between the regions of the Union, the macroeconomic imbalances between national economies, and the extent to which these imbalances have increased in recent years. In view of the difficulties in addressing these weaknesses, and the distinctive approaches of the Member States in their efforts to achieve fiscal adjustment and growth, we need to exploit every option, in terms of policy and resources, in order to achieve the common aim of stability and growth. The European Semester is, then, a pre-eminent tool for achieving this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, there is another aspect to it: it can contribute to the democratic legitimation of our decisions and policies. The possibility of participation by national parliaments is very important for the effectiveness of our policies, because the national parliaments can now participate with greater responsibility in the design of reform programmes and the budgets submitted, and also in the assessment of budgetary implementation and the effectiveness of the programmes; and, of course, they can contribute towards better governance and help to familiarise local players and the peoples of Europe with European objectives and European obligations.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition, the possibility of an ‘educational role’ is opened up, as the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, has said. There is a need for this educational role, and the national parliaments, which can play a part alongside the social partners, may contribute towards this.</p>
      <p sl="el">I therefore think the European Commission should be clear and specific in its recommendations, to show the true meaning of the potential offered by the European Semester, so that it can contribute to better governance and a more stable European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, my view is that the European Semester continues to improve in its functioning. At the same time, there are problems that must be addressed. A crucial problem is the Commission’s tendency to encroach on the autonomy of social partners in its country-specific recommendations. In this year’s recommendations, the Commission is recommending that the majority of countries reconstruct their national system for wage determination and the lowering of national wage levels.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission’s actions are unacceptable. Complete respect for the autonomy of the partners is vital for a well-functioning labour market. In addition, each attack on autonomy is a violation of fundamental professional freedoms and rights. This autonomy is determined in the ILO Convention, the Treaty on the functioning of the EU and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Here in Parliament, we have recently clearly defended this autonomy in the positions adopted in connection with the six-pack and the two-pack. Therefore, it is obvious that the Commission must change tack in connection with this matter.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Gauzès for a high-quality report on the issue of the European Semester. I have attended many meetings on this issue with representatives of national parliaments and wish to present to you two conclusions which arose from these meetings.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The first conclusion is that the European Semester is, in essence, a political process through which important options with regard to citizens’ lives are defined, and the report addresses these requirements with regard to the role of the European Parliament and the role of national parliaments. The second conclusion relates to the fact that in many Member States, the national parliaments are not consulted precisely at the stage at which governments draw up draft stability or convergence programmes, draft national reform programmes or draft programmes on the creation of new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This requirement must be addressed by the Member States first and foremost, and I think we have a duty here – both ourselves, the European Parliament, and the European Commission – to emphasise this aspect because normally the national parliaments get involved in this process when draft budgets for the following year are presented to them.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me to be extremely clear to all of us that no individual, family or country can spend more money than it has over the long term. At the same time, however, we must understand that balance, at the level of the governmental budget, between expenditure and income is not incompatible with economic growth. I say again, the so-called austerity policy is not opposed to economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Let us take my country, Latvia, as an example. During the time that our economy was shrinking rapidly, the government had no choice but to reduce its expenditure too; since the government’s income was also falling, it simply had no other option. However, what our government did at the same time (and this is often forgotten) was, while reducing total expenditure, to in fact increase long-term investment in the economy. The government increased cofinancing of the European Structural Funds, thus providing for economic growth in the future.</p>
      <p sl="lv">What is happening in our country today? Although we are unfortunately still a comparatively poor European state, nonetheless, in contrast to many other states, our economy is once again on the path of growth. The fact that we can observe this growth, and that this growth is possible, is only because at that time, when we had to save money, we carried on investing in long-term development. Ladies and gentlemen, the coordination of Europe’s economic policy is a very important issue, and we must continue this coordination in the future too. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Semester for economic policy coordination is a successful model. It provides us with an early warning system to identify imbalances in the EU Member States as soon as possible. The European Semester works effectively in tandem with the Stability and Growth Pact. At national level, settled policy measures must actually be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">The demands from the left to soften the rules again have no foundation. These demands would scupper any efforts to strengthen competitiveness and fiscal discipline in the Member States. Mr Kariņš has given a good example from his home town. Mr Gauzès makes it clear in his report that the approach of making consistent structural reforms while also consolidating the budget is fully justified. In this way the debt crisis can be better overcome, at last.</p>
      <p sl="de">After tough negotiations within the groups, we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed upon a well-balanced report advocating a careful strategy as part of economic and budgetary coordination. In future, however, I hope that, alongside the economic components, social concerns will be placed in the foreground once more. An intensification of social dialogue is just as important as progress in improving job quality, mobility within labour markets and training. Well done, Mr Gauzès.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, structural reforms and fiscal consolidation must be continued in order to overcome the current sovereign debt crisis, but they can only yield results over the medium and long term. To create a more integrated economic union, there needs to be better coordination between the macroeconomic and budgetary policies of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Semester is the appropriate framework through which to ensure effective economic governance. It was initially created to help identify cases where the budgets of Member States are not sustainable and possible negative collateral effects. Since then, however, it has been transformed into a powerful system for economic and fiscal coordination. I believe that the proposed measures should be improved to increase competitiveness and minimise imbalances. In addition, we should take a consistent and sustainable approach so that progress will be tangible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you have heard how much support there is for the procedures of the Semester that we are discussing. However, there has also been a realisation of how much confusion there is over the way the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments works.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think we should pay some attention to this matter and I also think it is important that we decide on a system of obligations and some sanctions for when someone tries to wriggle out of the debate on identifying common aims. I think the areas in which the autonomy of social partners should be respected need to be defined, as has been said, for the issues within their competence. However, I also think that in addition to discussing the architecture of the system of reports, it is also very important to identify priorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the midst of this period of deep crisis in Europe, of which you are well aware, with the fight against poverty on the one hand and growth policies aimed at mitigating the effects of austerity measures on the other, I think these priorities should be at the centre of relations with the Member States, which should be defined by means of the Semester.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the priorities of the European Semester for 2012 include differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to reduce the national debts, combating unemployment and modernising public management to ease the strain on public budgets. Given the raging structural crisis, it is more than ever of the greatest importance that everything possible should be done to put individual budgets in order, create sustainable jobs and invest accordingly in education and training.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should also mention that we are running the risk of not achieving the 2020 objectives, simply because Member States’ targets are too low and the measures put in place have created almost no progress in the areas of energy efficiency and employment.

However much the rhetoric about the need for growth and jobs is trotted out, the one thing that is sure is that it is the very recommendations under the European Semester which impose cuts in public investment, privatisation and, in several countries such as in Portugal, cuts in salaries, when a third of Portuguese earn salaries of less than EUR 600. In other words, what the Commission and the Council have recommended is more recession, more unemployment and more poverty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the report is not so much a piece of economic reasoning as a tautology. More integration is seen as necessary to achieve more integration. Coordination is not an answer to unemployment but is seen as an end in itself; it is not so much a cure for unemployment as displacement activity for those without a cure. The answer to the problems of the South is not austerity, which produces only more unemployment. It does not even do what is written on the tin, which is reducing debt. Most of the countries of Europe need reflation without inflation. We must remember that what is physically possible must be financially possible, or there is something wrong with the financial system.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank everyone for the very constructive debate, and am especially grateful to Mr Gauzès for the excellent report which, as has become clear based on this debate, is gathering a lot of support in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will make a number of remarks with regard to interventions made by several Members regarding, for example, the structural deficit and whether or not the contribution to the EU budget should be excluded from the calculation. I would say that the definition of the structural deficit does not relate to expenditure categories per se, but is a definition of the deficit where cyclical effects and one-off measures are not taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several Members also emphasised the need to strengthen the social dimension of the European Semester. The social dimension of the 2012 European Semester has already been strengthened in the 2012 annual growth survey, which included as a priority the need to address unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis. Equally, tackling youth unemployment has been a key priority for the Commission throughout 2012. A large number of Member States received a country-specific recommendation on this subject, including the eight Member States where youth unemployment is the highest. The Commission has also worked closely with those Member States in the first half of the year to refocus the use of EU funds on creating employment opportunities for young people and increasing their employability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the involvement of national parliaments – a topic that has been touched upon by several Members – let me firstly say that the Conference of the representatives of the relevant committees of the European Parliament and the representatives of the relevant committees of national parliaments is already taking place every year in the spring. This is an important practice which could be built upon further. Secondly, the Commission agrees that it is desirable to intensify the dialogue that is already taking place with the national parliaments, and we have formally committed to doing this in our reply to the contribution adopted by the last COSAC. We find it particularly relevant to give new impetus to such a dialogue in the context of the European Semester and could foresee an intensified dialogue at two separate moments during the Semester following the annual growth survey and the adoption of the country-specific recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the role of programme countries in the European Semester, the economic adjustment programmes for those Member States are aimed at ensuring a return to macroeconomic and financial stability and fiscal sustainability. These are the preconditions for sustainable growth and job creation, which are the ultimate objectives of the programmes and of Europe 2020. The objectives of the adjustment programmes are therefore aligned with those of Europe 2020. This is also reflected in the fact that the programmes are not all about public finances. These programmes also include important growth-enhancing structural reforms covering the most urgent issues in the respective Member States’ economies. The reforms pursued under the programmes thus span a wide range of areas to ensure that the countries concerned can realise soon smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and employment creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Berès – who is no longer with us – mentioned the problem of the forecasts and the IMF report on fiscal multipliers. Indeed, in its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF argues that the negative short-term effects of fiscal consolidation have been larger than expected because fiscal multipliers were underestimated. It is agreed that fiscal multipliers are larger in the current crisis than they would be in normal times. This is in line with the analysis we published in our autumn 2010 forecast.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the autonomy of the social partners, the social partners can in fact carry a very important responsibility and the Commission naturally fully respects their role as important stakeholders. But it is important that this responsibility is also exercised in the light of the European dimension. The Commission considers it not only its right, but indeed its legally mandated responsibility, to point out policy inconsistencies and potential sources of negative spillovers, including in areas where such autonomy of the social partners exists.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have a number of additional remarks to make. Mr Harbour emphasised the importance of the internal market. He is completely right in doing so because we can see, especially for example in banking and financial services, a fracturing of the internal market. That is a very alarming side effect of the enduring financial and economic crisis. We should certainly pay a lot of attention to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Eppink asked about sanctions in connection with the country-specific recommendations. Without going into details, there can be sanctions within the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, especially for Member States that are part of the eurozone.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to add that we will transmit all the remarks made by Members to Commissioner Rehn, who unfortunately could not be present today. Members can be assured that he will get a full report on everything that has been said here today.</p>

      <p sl="en">As regards Ms Trautmann’s request, I will give very serious consideration to withdrawing Amendments 4 and 5. Of course, I have to talk to my Group, since I am a loyal ordinary foot soldier; but I will do all I can to please you and to follow the recommendation made to me, by telephone, by my friend Mr Lamassoure.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the reference to the Fiscal Stability Treaty, there is a paragraph where we had fun but, strictly speaking, this reference is not of any consequence. In addition, we could be accused of talking about intergovernmentalism in a Union text; I will therefore also ask the Group for authority to remove paragraph 23 entirely.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that, in this way, the excellent cooperative work undertaken during preparation of this report may continue until the vote and thus show Parliament’s determination to make the European Semester a highly effective exercise.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard, I would like to say to Ms Zuber – I am a little sorry, Commissioner Barnier also just answered her – but it seems to me that we are not living in a time bubble and, without European solidarity, I dare not think what would be happening in some countries today. I think that has to be taken into account. Europe is not in the process of oppressing countries in difficulty. I think, on the contrary, that it is endeavouring to help them.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Semester, whose praises the right and social democrats sing, has been brought in ‘to coordinate economic policies’. Something that is ‘fundamental’ at this time of crisis in the EU, or so they say. Virtually everyone speaks of ‘coordination’ as an end in itself. They are concealing the nub of the matter: coordination around what and through what means? The Commission needs to provide an answer. As regards the ends, the recommendations for Portugal are crystal-clear: decrease salaries (in the country that has the lowest salaries in the EU); reduce the length of time unemployment benefit can be claimed (when unemployment is reaching historic levels and when long-term unemployment is on the up); more measures aimed at making labour relations ‘more flexible’ (read: raising the levels of exploitation to where they stood in the 19th Century). As for the means, we already know what they are: shrink national parliaments – the power structures closest to citizens and the ones they can best keep tabs on – to merely making up the numbers, puppets of the European institutions, having to submit their budget choices to the latter for scrutiny and subject to their prior censorship. The objectives of this ‘European Semester’, which represents a dangerous attack on democracy (even just understood at the merely formal level alone) are clear: ‘to coordinate’ a violent step backwards for civilisation in Europe, bringing down living and working conditions on the continent.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0270/2012) by Eider Gardiazábal Rubial, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on innovative financial instruments in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2012/2027(INI)).</p>

    <intervention id="4-444-000" speaker_id="96991" name="Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" nationality="Spain" birth_date="12-07-1975" birth_place="Bilbao" m_state="ES">
      <p sl="es">Rapporteur . − Mr President, Commissioner, here we are again, for the third time, in this House. If you will allow me, I would like to begin by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs for opinion for the work they have done to contribute to this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are three fundamental reasons why innovative financial instruments are an essential tool for helping us to get back on the path towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth:</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, because since the mid-1990s, public investment has been constantly declining in the European Union and, moreover, this trend has worsened with the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, because project promoters and SMEs are faced with an increasingly restrictive market and do not have access to credit or to the capital markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, because according to the Commission’s own estimates, implementing the Europe 2020 strategy is going to require EUR 1.6 billion.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thanks to the financial support provided by these instruments, we will help to increase the volume of investments in projects that we consider to be strategic for the development of the EU and which otherwise, due to market failure or sub-optimal investment situations, would not have received that funding. In addition, the application of financial instruments will help to ensure that finances serve the real economy and benefit projects with added European value.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union has been using these instruments since 2000 and, with the experience acquired since then and the evaluations that we have, we can improve the design for the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that we need to restrict the number of instruments and extend their scope of application: in this way we are going to improve their visibility for actors, we will expand their critical mass and diversify the risk thanks to a portfolio approach. In addition, the creation of equity and debt platforms will simplify and give greater coherence to the instruments. We also need a simpler, clearer and more transparent legal framework that does not increase the administrative burden on intermediaries and recipients and which is attractive to public and private investors.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another requirement that we consider to be fundamental is that these instruments be flexible and that therefore they have the capacity to adapt swiftly to change. We therefore ask that the budgetary authority, in other words Parliament and the Council, have the opportunity to adjust the amount allocated to each instrument according to needs and its use.</p>
      <p sl="es">In general terms, I think we can say that both Parliament and the Commission agree on the importance of the financial instruments and on the characteristics that they need to have, but we do not believe that the proposal responds to all the needs: these instruments are going to have a very positive effect, but unfortunately that will be in the short and medium term, and we need to seek a long-term response.</p>
      <p sl="es">We know that there are massive savings seeking secure, reliable financial products for investment. We need to be capable of mobilising those savings in order to be able to finance projects in the medium and long term that generate sustainable development in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, in this report I call on the Commission to work on proposals that can connect those savings with the investment needs, and I also ask it to work on a legal and regulatory environment that is conducive to their development, especially with regard to rules on long-term investments under the prudential rules Basel III and Solvency II. I do not know whether, in his speech, the Commissioner can tell us something now about the Commission’s work in this respect, but I am sure that the idea will be raised during the debate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, and although the Council is not with us, I would like to ask it to join with Parliament and the Commission because our proposals are along the same lines.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, not for the first time today, I have no ministers today at this time. On behalf of the Commission, we welcome your report and we really appreciate the efforts of the rapporteur, Mrs Gardiazábal. Gathering wide support for your report is a test of your skill, and we need the commitment of Parliament to the enhanced role of financial instruments in the next financial perspective (2014-2020) for a very simple reason. We are under huge constraints and should try to get as much as possible out of each euro of the European budget. We therefore need this multiplying effect of the other financial instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are right that is not a replacement for the budget; it is a multiplying effect of the budget. But it cannot be seen as a strategy to reduce the budget or to replace the grants by loans. Of course both are needed, and this is our message to the Council: we need multiplying effects, given the gap between the needs and what is possibly available as our resources. But this is not a replacement for the real budget, nor is it replacement by loans and revolving funds of the grants, which are the essence of the European budget. Why do we need them? Because the gap is visible; because we see, in a time of crisis, a sort of risk aversion – but it is mainly about banking. Banking is three-quarters of the financing in Europe, which is the opposite of what happens on the other side of the Atlantic where three-quarters comes from the capital markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Europe, this is mainly about the banking system, and under the credit crunch – under present-day circumstances – there is especially a high-risk aversion towards long-term projects in infrastructure. Therefore we need the involvement of the European budget to reduce the risk, to reduce the risk aversion and to finance long-term projects, especially in transportation, energy and telecoms. We will test the water now via these pilot projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy to inform you that we are about to sign an agreement with the European Investment Bank and to launch some interesting pilot projects under the present Financial Perspective (2007-2013) – again, fully in compliance with a statement in the report that it should be governed by very strict legislative budgetary rules. Before authorising the launch of a financial instrument, the Budgetary Authority should be fully informed and, by means of ex ante evaluations, should also be fully involved in monitoring the projects and final reporting.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we need flexibility, which was also a point in the report. Flexibility is needed to adjust to the fluctuations of the market and to the local environment in many countries of the European Union. Therefore, there is a need for the enhanced role of the financial instruments, which is absolutely necessary to fill the gap between what we need for Europe and possibly restrained financial resources in the European budget. Thank you for your cooperation. We are on the right road and this is the road to recovery, supplementing financial austerity with real growth prospects for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to give apologies on behalf of Ms Ivanova, detained by other Parliamentary activities, who has entrusted me with summarising for you the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our committee recognises that financial instruments are useful in creating multiplier effects and leverage effects, such as guarantees and tolls. However, we draw your attention to the recommendations of the Court of Auditors and its 2010 opinion on ownership of instruments, risk-taking, accounting, transparency and reinforcement of EU staff capacity to operate them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point concerns links with financial markets. We think that these instruments should only be used when there is no offer from the private sector, so as to avoid any distortion in financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, speaking personally, I am sorry that the idea of introducing an obligatory user contribution was not explored, in particular for trans-European transport networks that need financing, particularly those are not immediately profitable.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any line of argument should be based on the observation that the Commissioner made earlier, namely that the budgetary resources available are very inadequate, and so the meagre resources that we do have cannot be used just as grants, but should be used within ‘innovative financial instruments’, special funds, project bonds and so on, which should of course be developed.</p>
      <p sl="it">They should be developed within the system of public private partnerships, or PPPs, which will contribute towards the implementation of individual funding projects, leading to the creation of infrastructure, both physical and virtual, as part of sustainable projects. If this is done, it means that we can go even further and issue bonds because, if the projects are sustainable and reach a point where they break even, they are no longer debts but turn into long-term loans. In my opinion, Commissioner, that is where real growth lies, and we have to be bold enough to go beyond the budget.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, financial instruments within the EU represent financial support from the Union budget in the form of loans, securities, investment in capital and other risk-related instruments.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Transparent and flexible use of financial instruments while participating in the private sector can certainly accelerate and boost the flow of investments throughout the European Union at a time when, owing to the current paralysis in the banks, there would otherwise be no investments.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gardiazábal, because she, in essence, also included in her final report the majority of the amendments suggested by the Committee on Regional Development.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would just like to focus on a few points that are important in the use of financial instruments regarding cohesion policy. These can in fact have a significant role in achieving cohesion policy aims, because they allow more efficient use of public-sector funds.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We have been aware of financial instruments in cohesion policy for some time now. Their increased use, as proposed by the European Commission, may ensure more effective cooperation of the private sector in European investments in the next seven-year budget period and thus actually assist in securing financing for strategic regional investments.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is important that when promoting the extension of the application of these instruments, which over the next seven years may be used in all Structural Funds and cohesion funds and for a variety of purposes, we secure legal clarity, transparency and a simple system.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We need a very clear legal framework that is set out on time, definitely before the start of the new programming period. If we wish to promote the success of financial instruments, we must also improve and reinforce knowledge and technical capabilities regarding instrument use both at administrative level and among financial intermediaries, banks and end users.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Last but not least, it is important that in view of future, ever increasing, financial instrument use in all European policies, we provide a clear overview of all the risk-related mechanisms which come into effect with financial support from the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first of all want to praise the work done by Ms Gardiazábal Rubial, who has shown a very good grasp of the subject and an excellent spirit of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Development of innovative financial instruments, as proposed by the Commission, must be supported, since it allows finance to be placed at the service of the real economy and the growth and jobs goals that the EU has set itself, despite a context in which national public finances are being consolidated. It is indeed, therefore, as emphasised by the Commissioner, a powerful budgetary lever to serve our projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to make a few comments. Firstly, viable projects that do not receive sufficient financing from the market must benefit from these instruments as much as possible, in order for subsidies to be reserved for projects that generate less income.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we must ensure visibility of the EU budget, which risks being weakened as a result of the complex processes which these instruments entail, particularly since the general public’s knowledge about the role played by the European budget is not all that good. We should not lose ourselves in the mysteries of these arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, a balance must be found between the necessary control by the budgetary authority over the use of European funds and the flexibility that enables these instruments to adapt to economic circumstances and attract investment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, by way of conclusion, I would like to emphasise the part these instruments play in the prospects for developing capital markets in Europe, but also the importance of a ban on linking these instruments to complex products.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, many thanks in particular to the rapporteur, Ms Gardiazábal, who has done a great deal of work in connection with this very heavy subject of the future. This is a superb report. The economic future of Europe must not simply concern emergency measures to combat the crisis. It is equally about boosting the economy in the long term and increasing investments that have the ability to create growth.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The crisis is not simply a consequence of the banking and financial collapse, but has also been made worse by a long-term fall in the rate of investment. This has worsened since the crisis, and we are now down to dangerously low levels in terms of investments. At the same time, the need for investment is enormous, as has been pointed out by the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The problem is that the current tough restrictions for both the EU budget and the national budgets and more stringent capital adequacy requirements for banks etc. mean that we cannot produce any money without finding new ways forward. There are financial instruments, including project bonds, which last summer we agreed to test during a pilot phase, which was partly based on my own report. Loans from the EIB guaranteed by the EU’s budget will allow us to ensure that project companies can issue bonds that are more secure and more attractive, so that pension funds, for example, can focus on infrastructure projects instead of allowing the money to sit in various accounts.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am very pleased to hear that the Commissioner has now announced that work is already underway to bring specific projects to the table and sign contracts. The idea is that the pilot phase will be evaluated. We must see if perhaps in future we can raise even larger sums for the coming years, and perhaps also try other models with even greater potential.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In any case, I believe that this new financial instrument is required if we are to lead Europe away from austerity and recession and back to sustainable growth and job creation.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, for some time the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has wished that the EU budget would not simply give out subsidies, but would also promote specific policy through loans and guarantees, and through new financial instruments. We have actually been working towards this for many years, and we are therefore very pleased about the announcement made by the Commission. There are many good ideas, and I think that it is worth reminding people that in the European Investment Bank we have achieved genuine success – a genuine European success story. In these difficult times, it is a good idea to remind each other that we also have success stories.</p>
      <p sl="da">We must acquire more capital in order to carry out projects within areas such as research, innovation and transport infrastructure. Consequently, there are widely differing areas in which it is possible to raise money via the markets with the aid of the EU budget, and, as many people have pointed out, we can in this way have a far greater positive effect on our competitiveness, on our growth, on our employment, and that after all is ultimately what it is all about.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Commission is proposing a very broad range of instruments, and the Commission has adopted the right approach in that regard. However, it has not been said that the new financial instruments could replace the subsidies, or that the EU budget could be reduced by the same amounts, a point which has also been emphasised by the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would also like to emphasise the example we have with project bonds for which a pilot project is now underway – and I am glad to hear that that is the case – where EU guarantees will make it possible for major transport and energy projects to be financed as cheaply as possible on the lending market through the issuing of bonds. Such a lending market currently exists in the USA, where pension funds and other institutional investors can invest their money in infrastructure and thereby have a secure liquid investment with a reasonable rate of return.</p>
      <p sl="da">The intention of the pilot project is after all to test: is there any interest in such a market in Europe? This can be started up and, over the course of a number of years, we could end up with such a market in line with the USA, such that we can overcome the problem of national treasuries being empty, and having no opportunity to finance transport infrastructure via national treasuries.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, not all types of project will generate this level of interest; therefore there must still be subsidies. Overall, I would like to say: we firmly back the Commission’s proposal; it constitutes a limited expense for the EU budget, and there is no risk that we will be liable for any more money than has been allocated in the budget; thus it makes good sense. Thank you!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the development of innovative financial instruments may lead to an increase in public investment in the EU, where a decline has been seen since the mid-1990s. Innovative financial instruments should implement the political objectives of the European Union, respect the principles of proper financial management and supplement such traditional instruments as subsidies. They should be aimed at making it easier to implement projects, they should have a set completion date, and they should also give rise to an increased contribution of private capital for projects in the public infrastructure sphere, where they may serve as a guarantee of optimum utilisation of financial resources. One thing that will be of considerable importance in this area is a simple legislative framework which does not constitute a burden on intermediaries and beneficiaries, but causes these instruments to be attractive to both public and private investors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a concern, however, that innovative financial instruments will be utilised solely in short-term investments pitched at turning a quick profit, and will not be applied in the implementation of projects which provide intelligent and stable economic development out of concern for there being too great a risk and as a result of a lack of public funds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the backdrop to this report is the collapse of investment all across Europe. Public investment has been slashed as a direct result of the neo-liberal and austerity policies pushed by all of the major groups inside this Parliament, and by the Commission. But in addition private investment, as a percentage of GDP, has collapsed to the lowest level ever in the history of capitalism, and that is despite the increase in profits in Europe over the past three years. So instead of investing this wealth, they are choosing to hoard it or to speculate, to gamble with it on the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">That strike of capital is precisely why society must not accept them having the say over investment happening or not happening, them holding society hostage. But the response of the Commission is yet more reliance on these profiteers attempting to leverage public money with things like project bonds. The answer is not so-called ‘risk sharing’ with the private sector, where the private sector gets the profits and the public sector gets the risk, it is to reject the logic of the profit system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Massive and direct public investment is needed. There is no absence of funds in Europe. There is no poverty of overall resources in Europe: the rich – the major corporations – hold EUR 3 trillion that are being hoarded at the moment. The point is to take that wealth through the likes of a capital tax and invest it to create jobs and provide infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to add my congratulations to those of everyone who has already congratulated the rapporteur. I think that Eider Gardiazábal Rubial did an excellent job and I hope that many of the conclusions and recommendations of this report are going to be taken on board by the Commission and by the legislative bodies as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have said several times that these financial instruments are much needed because they increase the effectiveness of the European budget, but they are not here to replace the European budget. Currently, only a little over 1% of the European budget is involved in financial instruments. So far, we have good practice and we have to review that and to develop it in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">These financial instruments have a limited use. Normally they can be used for commercially attractive projects as a means of rectifying market inefficiencies, for suboptimal investments and to create leverage for the European funds, but again we are talking here only about long-term investments. I would point out that there are very good examples of financial instruments being used to support research, innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises, and I think we have to build on these achievements.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need – and I very much support what is said in the report on this point – fewer and better-focused financial instruments, and we do not need to over-regulate them. We should improve ex-post transparency and ex-post control but we cannot determine all the characteristics of the financial instruments in advance because they would not then be used properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, there are three things that I very strongly support: the work on the creation of standardised platforms, where European money can be combined with private money; ongoing and permanent work on the blending of funds from the European Union and from private and other public investors; and the use of the reflows coming back from the financial instruments for the same purposes.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would also like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Gardiazábal, on this report, which sends out a strong message.</p>
      <p sl="es">At a time of budgetary restrictions, recourse to the promotion of innovative instruments is key to achieving the effect of multiplying the EU budget’s effectiveness. Those of us who are working for the future of the EU’s cooperation policy are deeply concerned by the cuts to the multiannual financial framework that could be on the horizon, meddling that is rejected by 425 million citizens, who describe the European cooperation policy as efficient and necessary, and therefore as having a future.</p>
      <p sl="es">Development cooperation requires innovative mechanisms, such as joint funds, but according to predetermined standards. We support involving the private sector, but while ensuring transparency and accountability. The next multiannual financial framework must equip the current Financing Instrument for Development Cooperation and the new financing mechanisms with appropriate funds, because aside from generating poverty, the cuts are costing lives.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too would like to welcome the Commission’s proposal to increase the use of innovative financial instruments. Their introduction has been beneficial and has enabled the Union to stimulate investment in the real economy. Their visibility needs to be improved to make it possible to achieve the Union’s strategic objectives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would underline the fact that the continued development of innovative financial instruments will help to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. However, the increase in the number of instruments is posing many challenges in the areas of regulation and governance. In this context, the legal framework plays a particularly important role, and it must be as simple and as transparent as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, I would highlight the fact that we need to ensure that innovative financial instruments are attractive to public and private investors.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in the first half of the 1990s, the European Commission carried out various studies suggesting minimum amounts for the Community budget so that the objective of cohesion could be guaranteed. These studies said that a budget of at least 2 % of the European Union’s GDP was necessary. Commissioner, dig around, you might find them in a forgotten-about drawer somewhere.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Almost 20 years have elapsed since the biggest enlargement in the European Union’s history, which significantly increased internal differences; the budget is half this figure and some want to cut it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">They now want to ensure that just like the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves, even by cutting the amounts in the budget, you can have more available funds. There are many questions that arise with these financial instruments. From the public financing of private profit and risk to their failed application in cohesion policy in many countries, which the report itself recognises.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We do not need to waste much time inventing instruments that are, to all appearances, innovative but only help increase differences, inflate financial markets and conceal the real paths that could and should have been followed long ago, such as the essential increase in the Community budget.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, first I would like to express the opinion that the current structure of many diverse European financial instruments and cofinancing programmes is rather unclear for the public and private entities that want to make use of them. I believe that better coordination and streamlining of the structure of financial instruments and the Structural Funds would be desirable so that they might be more effectively used within a single integrated whole.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Financial instruments are designed to support the development activities of different users. There should therefore be a clear and comprehensive information system on their nature and determination so that potential candidates can learn about all the EU financial aid options for their planned activities in one place and in their native language. Finally, if we also want small businesses, entrepreneurs and community to benefit from these instruments, there should be a high-quality consulting and advisory service which would allow them to make an informed decision regarding the most effective combination of financial assistance for their investment plans.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, innovative financial instruments are of particular importance in the current period in order to relaunch the economy and achieve the strategic objectives of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I regret the fact that they have a largely undefined scope which can change rapidly, though in practice it is limited to projects with short-term and medium-term profitability. For that reason, I assert that innovative financial instruments should be used to generate smart and sustainable economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Public-private partnerships should thus be encouraged, in particular with SMEs, which need to be supported constantly in terms of research and innovation, through varied financial participation instruments. At the same time, to facilitate access to these new instruments for as many investors as possible and encourage their involvement, large-scale information campaigns need to be run across the whole of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to make some short comments. From the comments you have made in this room I can hear your support and commitment to a much bigger role of the financial instruments in financing in the European Union in the future. We have no other choice. There are clear needs and there are constraints in the budget. Therefore there is a gap to be filled by these innovative financial instruments, which have already been partially tested but are to be applied in part on a much larger scale and under certain conditions. This is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">The conditions have been agreed upon in the so-called revised financial regulation. There are two new parts in the financial regulation. One concerns simplification, in response to the popular request to simplify. The second is a completely new chapter on the innovative financial instruments. This is a set of rules on how to design, adopt and implement, but also how to control and monitor the application of this financial instrument. This is very important for the budgetary authorities, the Council, the Member States and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your excellent job on this very complex issue of new financial instruments. There is no other choice. We have to go ahead.</p>

      <p sl="es">Rapporteur . − Mr President, Commissioner, there is certainly very little left to add, as all those who have spoken have gradually sketched out what the characteristics of these innovative financial instruments should be for the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">There has been talk here of simplicity, transparency and also of information campaigns, so that people can be aware that these instruments exist, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which often imagine the world of EU bureaucracy to be complicated and too far-removed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Indeed, in the report we also state that there is a need to publicise these financial instruments, that we need to train regional and local organisations, as well as banks and small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they are aware that these financial instruments are available and know how to use them.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to make a small clarification, because sometimes there are questions as to when the financial instruments are used or why subsidies can or cannot be replaced.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are three investment scenarios: one that is optimal, in other words the project is generating income and is low risk, and it should therefore be financed directly in the market.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is another situation in which projects have low profitability but clear added value; in this case we are precisely in the territory of subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, between these two situations there is a middle ground: when there is significant profit but not enough to access the capital or credit markets, and that is where the financial instruments come into play.</p>
      <p sl="es">The financial instruments cannot, therefore, under any circumstances, be substitutes for subsidies, nor can they, under any circumstances, create distortions in the market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally we would like to clarify that obviously, as Mr Murphy said, private investment has declined, and we have unfortunately seen how, in recent years, the capital markets have resorted directly to speculation. That is, however, precisely what these financial instruments aim to prevent, because they are going to help profitable projects that we consider to be strategic for obtaining finance, thus avoiding speculation.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The introduction of innovative financial instruments (IFIs) at European Union level should support investment in the European economy in line with EU objectives. Innovative financial instruments should act as a catalyst in situations of market failure or suboptimal investment. IFIs should also mobilise financing from private investors. In the context of the multiannual financial framework, the Commission has extended the application of IFIs under the cohesion policy to those areas that bring growth. I wholeheartedly welcome this focus. As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I believe that the monitoring of IFIs should be developed and that their use should be well coordinated with other instruments to ensure their effective functioning. However, I must emphasise that when financing IFIs private investors should not be afforded priority treatment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Public investment in the EU has been falling steadily for almost 20 years, but this trend has become more pronounced since the start of the crisis. Both small and medium-sized enterprises and indeed everybody who requires a loan are finding that they are increasingly difficult to obtain. Innovative financial instruments could therefore be an important factor and a tool for the sustainable development of the EU. The Commission should provide a better information campaign on the new financial instruments at EU level so that all investors have equal access to these resources.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In addition, the initiative for the issuing of European bonds for infrastructure with strong added value with the direct participation of EU capital should be rigorously assessed. Furthermore, the Commission should submit proposals to facilitate the release of savings, an underused resource at present, to support medium- and long-term projects which generate sustainable growth in the Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Tomorrow’s vote in the European Parliament’s plenary session in Strasbourg will put a significant brake on speculative high-frequency trading and foodstuff trading – a further piece of the jigsaw of European financial market regulation following the crisis. We MEPs are the driving force in ensuring that irresponsible speculation and high-frequency trading is regulated. MiFID II will ensure that orders must be at least half a second in length to be valid and may not be cancelled or changed within that time span. I particularly agree with the restrictions that the European Parliament has placed on speculations on the raw materials markets. ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority, as the regulator, will be able to decide which market participants may sell which raw materials and in what amounts. This is an important first step in restricting speculation on raw materials, which drives food prices up, and in combating considerable market fluctuations. The proposals for the revised Directive and Regulation on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID and MiFIR) provide uniform trading rules for the protection of investors in order to improve the way the stability of the financial markets is protected. Therefore, I will vote for stronger regulation and the inclusion of over-the-counter business.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-468-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will start with the statement that the Danube strategy is very important for the European Union, because the Danube region covers 14 countries – eight Member States and six non-Member States – which are home to more than 100 million citizens. Since the introduction of the strategy I think we have been even more convinced about the interdependence of these states and about how much they can benefit from the improved cooperation and coordination of their actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have witnessed how their competitiveness could be improved if joint action is taken together, especially in the fields of SME support, labour market policies, education and security. Finally, we know very well that the Danube region has been the hot spot of the two last rounds of enlargement, and we are now using the Danube strategy to reach out to our potential new candidates in the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Communication on the EU Danube strategy was presented by the Commission in April 2011. We based it on four pillars: connecting the Danube region, protecting the environment, building prosperity and strengthening the Danube region. How far have we come after one year of implementation? The Commission is currently drafting its first report, which will be adopted early in 2013, but I would like to share with you a short preview of our current assessment.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, my colleague, Commissioner Hahn, travelled in the region and visited several initiatives which have been started thanks to the Danube strategy. It was quite clear that with the strategy we have produced a new dynamic: new cooperation at various levels – those of political actors, the business-to-business relationship and research communities. For the first time we have seen how countries are looking for joint solutions to the common challenges and how the strategy is very quickly becoming a long-term cooperation platform.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is very important for the future is how we can coordinate national and EU policies together. A clear example of how this could be done was the joint work of the Ministers of Transport, who adopted a declaration on the maintenance of the Danube waterway, which is a commitment to very concrete actions to improve the situation on the Danube.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is helping with providing new possibilities for renewing the Danube fleet, how to make it more modern and greener. We are helping to set up a Danube research and innovation fund to help researchers. The Joint Research Centre is currently setting up a Danube-wide set of data to improve decision-making for these actions and the gathering of environmental data. We are very pleased that police cooperation is also becoming a key priority for the Member States in the Danube region. And what must not be overlooked is how we can jointly promote a Danube tourism brand for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are only some examples. Yesterday Commissioner Hahn opened a new bridge between Romania and Bulgaria, the Calafat-Vidin Bridge. I think it is very important to say that this is only the second crossing point at the border, which is longer than 600 kilometres.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that in the future we will see far more concrete transnational projects, because there are already more than 50 projects which have been studied and labelled as the Danube regional projects and now they are waiting for the decision on how they will be financed and implemented in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of financing is of course crucial to further success. The strategy cuts across different Commission policies, and therefore we are trying to introduce the element of the macro-region into our future common strategic frameworks, partnership contracts and operational programmes, where we would need to see how financing could also be targeted at these very important Danube projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to recall that there was a clear request from the Council and the European Parliament to evaluate the concept of the macro-regional strategies by mid-2013. This will be a very important moment in terms of assessing how successful this concept is.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to thank the European Parliament for very instrumental work and support, and for its technical assistance to the Danube strategy, which is very much appreciated by the recipients and by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the way in which the crisis has developed has confirmed to us that interconnected markets are much more resistant, stronger and more amenable to rapid adaptations than those which are isolated or fragmented. A more powerful Europe therefore means a more integrated and more united Europe. The answer is clear: more Europe. Last week, President Barroso said in Bucharest that progress had been made in this regard, but it was not enough. Allies of cohesion and supporters of better spending must form a coalition to bring about growth.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Danube Strategy offers a unique opportunity through which stakeholders in competitiveness regions and convergence regions are uniting in support of this common goal. The challenges raised by the Danube macro-regional strategy consist of unprecedented measures through which it is possible to check the performance of the EU’s integrated policies, through the involvement of stakeholders in riparian regions within a multi-level governance framework. The reinvigoration of the Danube-Rhine corridor is facilitating the transportation of goods within the EU and is creating openness towards the east and third countries. The resulting advantages are helping to make Danube regions more competitive, supporting sustainability objectives by reducing transportation by land and creating employment opportunities. Of course, the strategy is also bringing socio-cultural benefits. Promoting the legacy of the Danube’s cultural heritage could lead to the creation of a Danube brand.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, we currently face certain obstacles to the implementation of this strategy. Yesterday, on the building site of the Calafat-Vidin Bridge over the Danube, Commissioner Hahn said that more connections were needed along a stretch measuring more than 650 kilometres, where there is currently just one bridge. For us to be able to call the strategy a success, we need to prioritise the removal of obstacles to cross-border connectivity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to ask you a question. The Commission’s position on the Danube Strategy is clear: no additional funds without the enactment of new laws and without other administrative structures. Do you think, though, that certain aspects of the Commission’s position are worth revising if the concrete results of the evaluations are positive? Similarly, for a new impetus, as you mentioned, does the Commission envisage direct intervention measures where hold-ups at inter-regional or, in particular, cross-border level are identified?</p>

      <p sl="hu">I am delighted that Mr Šefčovič, Vice-President of the European Commission, made his statement. However, the Danube Strategy – one of the greatest achievements of Hungary’s Presidency of the EU – is held in high regard by all countries in Central Europe and on the Danube, because cooperation is what is lacking the most in this region. It is great that the Danube Strategy has finally prompted the Danube states to work more closely together in the fields of transport, irrigation, shipping and tourism. It is very important to make the Danube navigable for shipping, and in this respect my own country, Hungary, has important things to do as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What is just as important for Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and all the Danube countries, though, is to use the Danube for irrigation purposes, as we barely use this irrigation capacity. Moreover, it is fantastic that in the second pillar of the reformed common agricultural policy EU funding will be available for rural development. This could act as a further incentive for all Danube countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, Parliament has always actively supported the Danube Strategy. The Danube Forum, of which I am the Chair, has 60 MEPs. Therefore, I am pleased to be the first signatory of the oral question to put the subject of the Danube on today’s agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">There has been some progress with regard to the Danube, such as the bridges I saw this summer between Widin and Calafat, on the international Danube bicycle tour. However, this progress is moving at a snail’s pace. There are still major difficulties: mayors in Bulgaria tell us that construction works on the Danube require consultation with seven ministries in Sofia. Other Danube residents have the impression in their Member States that the Danube is being marginalised in capital cities and not being placed in the foreground.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is why we are asking the Commission for more substantial results and measures. In the current programming period, the Danube Strategy should be provided with resources and for the future period we need a dedicated budget line for the Danube. We have specific projects, such as the Danube Manager, for which administration capacity needs to be developed. Small and medium-sized enterprises should be supported while they cooperate. There should be technology transfer centres.</p>
      <p sl="de">More than anything else, we need more opportunities for citizens to meet. We note that these citizens’ meetings must be supported otherwise they do not function. I have written to Chancellor Merkel and Commissioner Lewandowski to propose the formation of a Danube Youth Foundation. I therefore pose the question: can the Commission imagine itself financially supporting such a Danube Youth Foundation? Many young people would like to meet up, but cannot afford the tank of petrol or the train tickets they need to get to a meeting.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, parliaments should play a greater role. I hope that we in the European Parliament will act as leaders and invite the other national and regional parliaments to join in, so that we, too, take greater ownership of the Danube Strategy than ever before.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, it is very good that the Commission is making a statement today on the status of the implementation of the EU strategy for the Danube region. For us MEPs it is not always easy to obtain relevant and timely information – and this is even harder for civil society. This civil society in all the countries along the Danube is now being asked to get involved and co-design the implementation of the EU strategy for the Danube region, but how can they do this if they do not receive prompt and comprehensive information on the status of this implementation? Therefore, I ask the Commissioners, together with the partner countries, to make a special effort so that we receive relevant information from you on implementation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also ask you to reply to a written question that I and my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asked in July 2011. The question concerns navigability, in particular with regard to development of the free-flowing Danube in Bavaria between Straubing and Vilshofen. This is a particularly valuable nature reserve and a habitat for many endangered species. The valuable alluvial forests there would be completely destroyed by the dams. From a transport perspective, any development is totally pointless.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner Hahn answered the question in September 2011 but not every part of it. In particular, he did not reply to this question: what measures is the Commission taking to ensure transparency in decision-making and implementing bodies and the independence of expert groups? You know that local residents are fighting for a free-flowing Danube, so it is vital to gain clarity on which stakeholders could be influencing the independence of experts.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the actions for the Danube macroregion do nothing to meet people’s needs, such as employment with rights, education, housing, culture, flood protection works and projects to harness the water resources. The vision for the macroregion is not concerned with industrial and rural development based on these criteria, but with the deepening of the capitalist single market and capitalist restructurings which have led people into unemployment, mass poverty and bankruptcy.</p>
      <p sl="el">These actions serve the antipopular Europe 2020 strategy and the energy giants, drawing off significant funding for the benefit of the ‘Interconnecting Europe’ plan. The redirection and exploitation of cohesion policy funds will mainly benefit the profitability of EU undertakings which are active on the international markets; it will intensify the destruction of workers’ rights and favour unequal development.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is why we believe that the greatest losers will be the workers who are called upon, at great sacrifice, to support growth which has nothing to do with their needs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to point out that the Danube region strategy is based on an Austro-Romanian initiative. Austria has something to offer here, owing to its historical experience. Commissioner, I do not want to discuss the four pillars you listed – I would just like to examine the problem areas of road and air transport infrastructure in the Communication. There is really a lot to be done.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have looked into what has been proposed in connection with EU policy and I could only find Europe 2020. This sector, which has special significance for the area, would be an ideal sphere of activity for the new Connecting Europe programme. I think that, in its assessment and in its macroeconomic screening, the Commission must at all costs place special emphasis on the Connecting Europe programme, particularly in the areas of road and rail construction and air transport connections, since relevant resources are available for this. They must be used meaningfully here: these resources and this programme can do a lot for this area and for the entire region – this can also make an impact on the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="bg">In these meetings people’s expectations materialise before our own eyes: roads and river ports; clean air, soil and water; cultural, historical and tourist sites; youth education centres; functioning small and medium size enterprises. What else do we need?</p>
      <p sl="bg">Firstly, political willingness to bring the Danube Strategy to a successful conclusion. Have courage, Commissioner: the European Parliament will support you.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, joint action, coordinated and clearly defined deadlines, objectives and responsibilities. And thirdly, specific projects to resolve joint problems, together with simplified procedures.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Two things are important for me:</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like to draw special attention to the participation of young people in the Danube Strategy. These are the people of the future, the carriers of creativity and innovation. They can give the Danube Strategy an extra boost to meet its objectives.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, we need strategic investment. Here we are voting on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. Commissioner, what resources can we rely on?</p>
      <p sl="bg">Finally, I believe that it is only with adequate resources, very precise and coordinated action and clear priorities and strategic investment that we can turn the strategy of three ‘no’s’ into a strategy of three ‘yes’s’: ‘yes’ to better use of funds, ‘yes’ to better coordination between institutions, and ‘yes’ to new ideas implemented in concrete projects that improve the life of the people along the Danube.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, cooperation within the Danube basin has been strengthened over the last few years, and the fact that a good many of the countries through which the river flows are members of the European Union has been, and is, the main glue holding this cooperation together.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union is developing new cooperation instruments in this area, such as the Danube Strategy, and I hope that this will serve as an adequate framework for as much sharing of experience and best practice as possible between the local and regional authorities in the Danube basin so that the objectives proposed through this Strategy can be achieved. Only through ongoing experience-sharing, scientific assessments in the event of pollution and strong political will can proper cross-border management of possible cases of accidental pollution or large-scale disasters be put into effect. Only together can the countries along the river work to achieve common objectives, and with adequate financing for this important project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, our strategy for the Danube region is a significant project, a response by the European Union to an initiative from the people. It is precisely this positive engagement by the people living along the Danube that has led to the creation of this highly active macro-region. As I understand it, the bottom-up approach was applied very successfully in designing the strategy for the Danube region. The European Parliament was the driving force in this process. It is vitally important that we continue to support the desire and commitment of the population in the current implementation phase of the strategy. The strategy for the Danube region must not be filed away but must be translated into actual projects together with the people on the ground and brought to life. That is why your statement today is so important, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="de">The declared aim of the strategy is to create prosperity and employment along the Danube. The future of the whole Danube area will be sustainably created through increased networking, especially through infrastructure and through intensive exchange. In my view, the areas of economic and educational cooperation are key aspects. The participating actors along the Danube will benefit from cooperation on economic/technical projects and from educational and social measures. With this aim in mind, Europe-wide alignment of the higher education system with bachelor’s and master’s degrees, as well as dual training, should be intensified in the Danube region. I think that my federal state, Baden-Württemberg, is a good example of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">After 2013 I would like to see the strategy for the Danube region and its structural networks integrated in all regional policy measures. Commissioner, this is the future of a part of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the need for European solutions and European emergency plans is nowhere more obvious than in the case of European rivers, since they connect European countries. A bad example of this is the catastrophe two years ago when contaminated sludge from a Hungarian aluminium factory flowed into the Danube. It became obvious in that case how important cooperation is.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, seamless transport connections are especially important. As co-rapporteur of the report on the development of the trans-European transport network, I consider inland navigation as an important means of transport, because it is environmentally friendly and still has potential for growth. At the same time, we must also comply with emissions targets. We cannot expand at any cost. This means that we must place ecological considerations and environmental protection in the foreground and at the heart of this process.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have heard today that one of the last free-flowing sections of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is this kind of bad example. In my view, the environment must take precedence here. In the meantime, the CSU environment minister in the government of the state of Bavaria has recognised this. Now he has to convince his Bavarian Prime Minister and the Federal Transport Minister that any investment in further studies is unnecessary and that any investment – I refer here to the EUR 16.5 million which the Commission has also invested in this study – is, unfortunately, money spent in vain. It would be better spent – as Mr Theurer has mentioned – in the Danube Youth Foundation. This is the direction we need to take in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, Ms Lochbihler, thank you for your question. There is actually a certain contradiction in the Danube region strategy: on the one hand is the objective of environmental protection and on the other hand is the objective of supporting those who want to destroy the Danube. I will say quite clearly: it must not be a question of mobility at any price. The ships that travel on rivers must adapt to the rivers, not vice versa. If we give both these objectives equal importance, I can see how we can achieve both goals. Ecological considerations are at least as important as economic components.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, the Danube region has undergone significant change in recent years, and there are various options available to resolve the challenges in the region. It could link the European Union with its close neighbours as well as the Black Sea region, the Southern Caucasus and Central Asia. The EU’s strategy for the Danube region could contribute to achieving Union objectives as well. Economic development, competitiveness and environmental management do leave something to be desired. Transport network links must be modernised and access to information technology systems expanded. Thus, thanks to better infrastructure and alternative resources, energy could become cheaper and more secure.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Close collaboration is required to avoid risks and disasters. The Danube region accounts for one fifth of EU territory, and could play a key role in the life of Europe. By exploiting the significant research and innovation opportunities available, the region could become a leading player in the EU in a commercial and business sense too.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the Danube emerges from the Black Forest and heads east, connecting the countries which expected or are still expecting economic and social convergence from EU accession. This underlines the importance of the Danube Strategy as it symbolises the cohesion and solidarity between the western and eastern sides of the continent. The strategy for the Danube region should be considered as an implementation plan of the EU cohesion policy for one group of countries. All that remains is to flesh out the strategy with content and specific projects aimed at the joint, coordinated development of countries in the region and the rebirth of Central Europe. This offers a good opportunity to re-think the cohesion priorities to ensure that the investments implemented are definitely those which will bear fruit in the long run and improve standards of living for our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we should, I think, regard the Danube region primarily as a main business route and develop it as such. Then we will know what investments are meaningful and sustainable if a master plan is developed to integrate projects that start in the transport sector, move into the energy sector, integrate industrial policy and, of course, extend to tourist projects. However, this strategy will only be successful if these projects are coordinated with each other. Therefore, I propose that, just as in the execution of the TEN-T core network corridors, a coordinator be appointed and States be obliged to submit timescales and investment plans in order to be able to proceed strategically in a similar way to how the core network corridors should.</p>
      <p sl="de">My question to the Commissioner is: to what extent is he proposing that the development of the Danube corridor, which is one of the 10 core network corridors, should be linked to the development strategy of the Danube region concept?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Strategy for the Danube Region, which was initiated by Romania and Austria, could bring a number of particularly important benefits for this region, but at the moment, unfortunately, I observe a number of fairly major problems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To bring the opportunities offered by the Danube to full fruition and to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion in this region, we must provide substantial financing first and foremost. As the Union’s resources are limited and the absorption of European funds is very low at the moment, I believe that the Member States, together with the European Commission, must make further efforts both to improve the level of absorption of European funding and to attract capital from private sources. Only by this means will this vital region for Europe become an important driving force for our economy and make a substantial contribution to increased European wellbeing, representing a factor for stability, development and prosperity in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Danube Basin offers great opportunities for cross-border cooperation between countries through whose territory this European river flows. The Danube is also a major waterway that allows the transport of goods from the Black Sea to Germany. From an economic perspective, shipping is the most advantageous mode of transport, suitable especially for the transport of goods. An improvement of navigation parameters on the Danube by increasing and stabilising the water level would allow ships with a greater displacement to sail deeper into the European mainland.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Expansion of the waterway transport capacity will also generate new employment opportunities along the entire length of the watercourse, and therefore I believe the Commission initiatives in this area should be supported. An emphasis on environmental protection in the expected construction investments must be an integral part of their assessment, however. We therefore need to assess the economic and development potential of the Danube with both pragmatism and great sensitivity.</p>

It is very important that we can finally start achieving worthwhile results as the interlinked markets could offer many benefits for the region concerned: they could result in more effective operation, enable greater competitiveness and create sustainable jobs. The Danube is a natural source of links and connections that clearly outlines one of Europe’s main development regions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Moreover, it brings countries outside the EU into this cooperation framework, which could therefore signal closer interdependence and thinking along more common lines. Consequently this could represent further progress for cooperation between countries within and outside the European Union. As a Hungarian MEP I am proud that the Hungarian Government did everything it could to fill this programme with suitable content. Just a few weeks ago a list was sent to the Member States of specific projects which could be implemented jointly as part of this cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, today we have, to a certain extent, been given good reason to look positively on one year of the Danube strategy. Much has already happened: in this area, where 115 million Europeans live, more than 275 projects are now under way. There is already very good cooperation at the administrative level and at the level of the Member States and local communities involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this Danube strategy has not succeeded for the people, the citizens. A few days ago, in Lower Austria, at Danube University Krems, we took part in a conference entitled ‘Focusing on people’. The task before us today is to develop this Danube region strategy further such that it can be carried on by civil society. We need to make efforts to ensure that the cohesion of this region and mutual understanding grow. What is also very important is that we need the development of the Danube. We need it because we only use about 10 % of its transport capacity. However, we may do this only if nature and biological diversity are really taken into consideration.</p>

The Strategy has made it possible to develop infrastructure projects which are particularly important for the whole region. One of them is the Calafat-Vidin Bridge, which was co-financed with European funds and is due to be completed in 2013. Another important project is the tourist mini-port in Sfântu Gheorghe, which was inaugurated in 2011 and will boost tourism in the Danube Delta significantly. These are clear pieces of evidence of the way in which the Danube Strategy is driving cooperation in the region forwards.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank Members very much for this debate. I will try to respond to four major topics which were raised: management and financing, environment and transport, transparency, democratic scrutiny and the treatment of youth, and, of course, reporting and implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">First I would really like to thank everyone for their interventions, because it is very rare that one feels such overwhelming support for our common work. I think all Members believe that Europe needs the Danube strategy and that the strategy still has a lot to offer and that we are actually only starting to grasp the potential of what we can achieve through this macro-regional approach – as was said by the President – to our common history, common past and also, I believe, common future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to continue to the questions raised by Mr Matula, Mr Tabajdi and Mr Toia concerning the management of financing and environment. What will be very important, of course, is to achieve a good solution on 22 and 23 November, and at subsequent negotiations with the European Parliament on the multiannual financial framework. This will only be the start, though, because if we want to succeed in this effort it will be quite important to have very close collaboration with the Member States and with the regions. We need to work on planning together what should be the key projects to be carried out under the umbrella of the Danube strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be very helpful if funds could be earmarked for the projects now, so that we know the list of priority projects and what is important for the Danube regions and know which projects we would like to see implemented and financed through the cohesion and Structural Funds in the next period.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we will try to do in the Commission will be to use the fact that this approach is already included in the draft regulations on cohesion policies, and we will do our best to include these in the common strategic frameworks, in the partnerships contracts and in the operational programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question was asked by Mr Toia and Mr Matula on how the Commission might be more closely involved in the planning and preparation of these projects. We consider that we can do this through our involvement in the drafting of partnership agreements and through our common management under the common strategic frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="en">We realise that, as was said during the debate, in several Member States the absorption capacity of EU funding is not the best. We could do a lot by managing those funds better, synergising and offering additional technical assistance to those Member States which clearly have a problem with absorbing EU structural funding. I believe that this is something on which we have to focus, not least via the financial regulations which were approved today, which offer new ways of simplifying the whole procedure, and through which we should definitely achieve much better results in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the environmental and transport, the key issue is always how to balance environmental aspects and navigational needs when it comes to such important waterways as the Danube. I agree that it is very important to use independent expertise, which is always how the Commission approaches these issues. It is also important to involve the public in the discussions and find out how citizens would like to reconcile the environmental aspects and also navigational needs in their regions. Therefore, the issue of democratic scrutiny and closer involvement of national and regional parliaments and the public in these debates is very important – not only from this point of view but also from that of what the EU can actually achieve through the good implementation of the Danube strategy in specific regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a question on orienting more of our attention towards youth. I agree with that fully because there is a high unemployment rate across Europe and we can see how young people can benefit from youth programmes. Priority area No 7 is focused exactly on these issues and is about bringing together universities, introducing common Masters and PhD programmes for young people and also strengthening youth mobility programmes in the Danube region, which would be a very good opportunity for young people to get to know each other better and also to look for further opportunities for studying and later on for work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the question on the Danube waterway and its corridor priority, I would like to confirm that the Danube waterway is in the TEN-T network and therefore it will be treated as a priority project under the next multiannual financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last set of questions was aimed at how we would report, how we would inform Parliament on what has been done under the Danube strategy. As I said, we are now working on the assessment of the first year of implementation, and I can assure you that the report will be prepared well before June next year. I hope that we will find in it a lot of experience that can be used for the next period and also a lot of retrospective on what could have been done better under the current period. I hope that it will also serve as an inspiration for the new project and the new activities we can pursue under the Danube strategy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union has always incorporated a regional dimension into its initiatives. The entire process of European integration can to some extent be regarded as an expression of awareness of the regional factor – problems and benefits which, by virtue of geographical proximity, cannot be addressed by countries acting in isolation. It is particularly important for the Danube region, which is a historic focus of development of the civilisation and economy of Europe, to develop its potential and once again become a primary axis of the European Union. The development by the European Union of a strategy for this region which encompasses many sectors is important not just from the point of view of the complex sectors addressed – the environment, transport, economy or governance. The EU Strategy for the Danube Region has a major role, because it truly puts the institutional capacity and direct benefits of the integration project to the test. What many states in the region want is not necessarily a contribution of material, human or financial resources, but a real transfer of expertise and experience. Environmental protection, the development of a more interconnected public transport system or the construction of an integrated and efficient environmental protection system require, first and foremost, institutional consolidation of the cooperation process, along with the extension of best practice in the target sectors.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Danube and its tributaries form one of the most important water systems in Europe. The Danube has played a crucial role in the political, socio-economic and cultural development of central and south-eastern Europe. It is the most international river basin in the world, covering 817 000 km2 , a third of Europe, and crossing 18 countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Danube is overwhelmingly important for Europe’s biodiversity. The Danube Delta is home to more than 5 200 species of flora and fauna. However, the river and its wildlife have suffered considerable losses, especially over the last century. At present, the Danube basin covers just 20 % of the area which was originally covered by water, only half of which still has natural characteristics in the true sense of the word. Many areas are polluted, and defective sewerage systems and buildings have increased the risk of flooding and exacerbated the problems caused by pollution. In view of the above, I believe that an EU Strategy for the Danube Region is necessary.</p>

      <p sl="sk">This area brings together 14 countries, 6 of which are EU Member States. Covering one fifth of EU territory, the Danube region’s wellbeing is inextricably linked to that of the Union as a whole. Many of the region’s problems know no borders, and these all demand a united approach. I am convinced that the economic disparities and under-investment in infrastructure need to be addressed. The fact that migration, climate change and security can have a particularly intense impact in the area owing to the region’s political and geographical characteristics should also not be overlooked.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Environmental issues are particularly pressing for both reasons of biodiversity and to protect cultural heritage. It is important to embrace the Danube Strategy as a problem that addresses a priority. It represents the solution presented by people living in the region for people living in the region. There are four priorities: connecting the Danube region, protecting the environment in the Danube region, building prosperity in the Danube region, and strengthening the Danube region. The strategy was established as the second EU macro-regional approach, and is similar to the strategy for the Baltic Sea region.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am convinced that this strategy presents an opportunity to implement a long-term recovery programme for the Danube region and the more efficient exploitation of the potential of the Danube countries. Through appropriate partnership and cooperation with the countries of this area it is possible to strive to improve people’s lives, and to increase their social security and cohesion. Equally important is the support for cross-border cooperation and the removal of barriers to bringing the people and countries of the Danube region closer together.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0297/2012) by Erminia Mazzoni, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the Annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman 2011 (2012/2049(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are again to sum up the work of the European Ombudsman this year, like every other year. The overall assessment, in this case at least, is overwhelmingly positive. As I recall, the European Ombudsman’s powers are conferred by Article 298 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and his main function within the network of European ombudsmen is to guarantee respect for the right of citizens to good administration and also, in particular, respect for the rights guaranteed by Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which states that every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">This year – and let us be clear that I am talking about 2011 – the European Ombudsman registered fewer complaints than in 2010; the total number fell from 2 667 to 2 510. What was new about these complaints is that more than 61 %, just over 61 % of these complaints were submitted using the internet. Of these 61 %, 53 % were submitted by citizens using the form on the European Ombudsman’s web portal. This fact is very dear to my heart as Chair of the Committee on Petitions, which for some time now has been asking for an internet service and web portal that are better tailored to citizens’ petitions.</p>
      <p sl="it">The number of requests for information and clarifications fell significantly in 2011, and we all agree that this is because of the excellent guide produced by the European Ombudsman, which has succeeded in cutting the number of these requests for information. The number of petitions erroneously submitted to the European Ombudsman also fell, and by this I mean the number of petitions incorrectly sent to the Ombudsman because they were outside his mandate. This is certainly also due to two other information sources used and produced by the European Ombudsman’s office to help and facilitate the process for citizens. The Ombudsman also changed some procedures in 2011 to make them simpler. This work and these best practices introduced by the Ombudsman have undoubtedly had a positive impact on the results of the services that he provides.</p>
      <p sl="it">Out of the total number of petitions presented by citizens, we should point out that the number of complaints against the European Commission is still quite high, and accounts for the largest share of all complaints, at 58 %. In the Commission’s defence, it should be explained that, because the Commission has executive powers, for citizens it is the most easily identifiable target, but this does not completely exonerate it from blame and Commissioner Šefčovič will, I am sure, have something to add on this matter. It is nice to know that Parliament, on the other hand, has reduced by almost half the number of complaints against it, while the number of complaints against the Council is rising. Most of the inquiries opened by the Ombudsman were completed (of 382 opened, 318 were completed) and I think that is an excellent performance.</p>
      <p sl="it">My closing comment is that there is one flaw in this activity, and it is this: like all institutional persons involved in the protection of citizens’ rights, who have no actual powers for making sure citizens’ complaints are resolved, the Ombudsman’s procedures can conclude with a recommendation or in serious cases with a critical remark, but they cannot provide citizens with a direct solution.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I now give the floor to Mr Diamandouros. It is always a pleasure to see you here one more year on the occasion of the evaluation of the report on your activities. It is excellent news because it proves that after so many years you and I are in good health, so you have the floor.</p>

    <intervention id="4-504-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Nikiforos Diamandouros" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Ombudsman">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, in good health in the presence of the Commissioner for Health! I wish to thank you for this opportunity to address you on the subject of my annual report for the year 2011. I would like first of all to say that I am grateful to Parliament’s continued support for the work of the European Ombudsman. I wish also to express my sincere thanks to the Chair of the Committee on Petitions, Ms Mazzoni, for her thorough and insightful report on my activities, to which we just listened. As I have repeatedly stated, the support of Parliament and the collaboration of the Petitions Committee are essential contributors to the success of the European Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the key statistics of the annual report. During 2011 I received a total of 2 510 complaints from citizens, companies, NGOs, associations and others. I try to help every complainant who turns to the Ombudsman, even in cases when the complaint is not within my mandate. We should not underestimate how important it is for citizens to be guided to the most appropriate complaint-handling mechanism and body from the outset and to be spared the frustrations and delays associated with having to identify the right institution on their own.</p>
      <p sl="en">In January 2009 I launched an interactive guide on my website which is accessible in all 23 official languages. This guide aims to direct complainants to the body best placed to help them, be it my own services, the Petitions Committee of Parliament, the services of national original ombudsmen in the Member States, or existing problem-solving mechanisms established by the European Commission such as the ‘Your Europe’ portal or the Solvit network for cross-border problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The number of inadmissible complaints submitted to me continued to decline in 2011, this time by 111. In large part, I attribute this decline to the fact that, by using the interactive guide, more citizens are finding the right address to turn to the first time round. In 2011, more than 18 000 people received advice through the guide. Counting the number of requests for information replied to, and complaints that were dealt with, we can say that over 22 000 citizens were directly helped by the Ombudsman in 2011. Furthermore, the Ombudsman’s website received over 295 000 unique visitors.</p>
      <p sl="en">In contrast to the reduction in the number of complaints outside my mandate, the number of inquiries opened in 2011 rose to 396, that is, showed an increase of 18 % (one-eight). This strength confirms that, increasingly, the people turning to the European Ombudsman are doing so for the right reasons. The large increase in inquiries opened is also a result of changes I have effected to my own procedures to make them more citizen-friendly. A new type of inquiry was introduced this past year to allow complainants to clarify their complaints in cases where I am not initially convinced that there are grounds to ask an EU institution for its opinion on the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">A sustained reduction in critical remarks issued by my office is further positive evidence that the EU institutions are positively responding to my recommendations and that they are taking a more proactive role in resolving complaints and in enabling win-win outcomes. This is obviously always preferable to the complainant and the institution concerned. Over the last three years the number of critical remarks has averaged just above 34, whereas the average was just above 46 in the period 2006-2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">This year I have again included in the annual report the category of ‘star cases’ in order to highlight illustrative examples of exemplary administrative practice by institutions and bodies revealed through my inquiries and, in addition, to emphasise that a central function of the Ombudsman institution is to strengthen and deepen a culture of service in the EU institutions and bodies by promoting and supporting best practice. Ten such star cases are highlighted in this year’s report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The institutions’ willingness to cooperate with the Ombudsman to achieve a satisfactory resolution to complaints constitutes an important expression of their commitment to this culture of service. I also note that, in some of the cases, the constructive engagement of the complainants themselves also proved crucial to obtaining a win-win outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to a special Eurobarometer survey on citizens’ rights and on the performance of the EU administration, which was commissioned by the Parliament and the Ombudsman and was published during 2011, the right to move and reside freely in the EU is considered to be the most important citizen’s right (48 % of respondents). The second most important right is the right to good administration (33 %) followed by the right to complain to the Ombudsman (32 %). On the other hand, 42 % of respondents indicated that they are not satisfied with transparency in the EU administration, and 52 % said that the Ombudsman should ensure that citizens know their rights and how to use them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Making a priority of the policy goal of informing citizens, in March 2011 I held the biggest stakeholder event ever organised by the Ombudsman, which was entitled ‘Is the Lisbon Treaty delivering for citizens?’ Major speakers in this event included the President of the European Council, Mr Herman Van Rompuy, the then Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mrs Diana Wallis, and the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs Viviane Reding.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also published, in 2011, a booklet entitled ‘Problems with the EU? Who can help you?’ This new publication provides information on a whole range of problem-solving mechanisms available to individuals who face problems with the EU. I note that the demand for this booklet has been higher than for any other publication in the entire history of the Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of the level of dissatisfaction with transparency in the EU, I used the occasion provided by the celebration of ‘International Right to Know Day’ on 28 September to call upon the EU administration to be more proactive as regards transparency. In that context I called on the EU institutions to adopt useful, citizen-friendly online registers of documents. Furthermore, as regards my own services, in early 2011 I began publishing, on my website, information on new inquiries as soon as they are opened. This new practice makes it easier for citizens to follow the progress of inquiries right from the start.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2009 I adopted a mission statement for the European Ombudsman institution which reads as follows: the European Ombudsman seeks fair outcomes to complaints against European Union institutions, encourages transparency and promotes an administrative culture of service. He aims to build trust through dialogue between citizens and the European Union and to foster the highest standards of behaviour in the Union’s institutions. In order best to implement this mission statement, in 2010 I developed and adopted a strategy for the institution which forms the basis of my initiatives and activities during my current mandate as Ombudsman.</p>
      <p sl="en">Key points of this strategy include: first, strengthening the ongoing dialogue with complainants, civil society and other stakeholders in line with central commitments enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon; second, identifying best practices from Ombudsman colleagues through, amongst others, cooperation in the European network of ombudsmen; and third, enhancing the Ombudsman’s role in promoting an administrative culture of service in the EU institutions. In order consistently to deliver good administration – a key component of being citizen-friendly – institutions and bodies need to nourish and nurture a culture of service to citizens. A body which seeks to promote such a culture of service will encourage the members of its staff not only to respect good administration as a legal right but also to be polite, helpful and cooperative in dealing with citizens, willing to explain their activities and the reasoning behind decisions taken and ready to accept public scrutiny of their conduct. With these considerations in mind, I concluded that it would be useful to produce a concise statement of these and other public service principles which could help promote citizens’ trust in the European civil service and the EU institutions. The Public Service Principles were published on 19 June this year and are contained in a very small leaflet, which is this one. Allow me to mention them briefly. One: commitment to the European Union and its citizens; two: integrity; three: objectivity; four: respect for others; five: transparency. I am grateful to DG Personnel for having distributed the principles to everyone working within Parliament on 4 October.</p>
      <p sl="en">President, honourable Members, as I have repeatedly indicated, this statement of pubic service principles is neither the first nor the last word about the ethical standards that apply to the EU civil service. As the submissions to the public consultation made clear, the Staff Regulations, the Financial Regulation and the Ombudsman’s widely-adopted European code of good administrative behaviour already embody such standards, both explicitly and implicitly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the idea of producing a statement of pubic service principles was not to develop new ethical standards but rather to make clear the expectations of both civil servants and citizens for making an everyday reality of the ethical standards to which the EU public administration already adheres. The added value of making the standards explicit is to help generate and focus a continuous, constructive discussion among civil servants and between civil servants and the public about what behaviour is ethically appropriate. The public consultation demonstrated the value of such a debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The principles do not seek to duplicate existing instruments or to be a substitute for revisiting, revising and supplementing those instruments where that may be necessary. Rather I expect them to be a rich source of ideas on which I will draw in working with the institutions of the EU in the future to encourage and nurture the institutional culture that makes the principles a living reality.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission welcomes Mrs Mazzoni’s very comprehensive and informative report. I would like to congratulate her and the Committee on Petitions on this very important piece of work.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Ombudsman reported himself, it offers a clear and exhaustive overview of the Ombudsman’s activities for the past year and represents a very useful tool for the other institutions as well. Both reports remind us very clearly of our common goal, which is to ensure open, efficient and independent European administration for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank Mr Diamandouros personally for his excellent cooperation and for his assistance in enabling us to do our job better. His insights and suggestions are always very welcome, and I appreciate the very fruitful contact on a political and also on a service level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several figures have been offered and proposed by Mrs Mazzoni and also by Mr Diamandouros, but allow me also to bring in some of our own. The fact is that the Ombudsman’s enquiries continue to be focused mostly on the European Commission, of which they represented 58 % in 2011, which is a little bit less than in 2010, when the figure was 65 %. I also agree with the conclusions of Mrs Mazzoni’s report that to a great extent it is natural for the European Commission to be the principal addressee of the enquiries as it is the biggest institution, with executive powers. How have the complaints and cases been handled by the European Ombudsman? The European Commission had 365 replies to the Ombudsman in 2011 in comparison with 375 in 2010. We are very much aware of the importance of friendly solutions and we strive to achieve, if possible, a win-win situation. Both reports conclude that there was a positive upward trend in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would also like to note that the number of critical remarks received by the Commission has steadily decreased since 2007. In 2011 they represented 11 % of all the enquiries closed. It is very important to mention that in 2011 the Commission sent 25 replies to the European Ombudsman’s critical remarks, and the Commission totally or partially agreed with the Ombudsman in 18 cases, which represents a considerable share of the total – 72 %.</p>
      <p sl="en">On top of this, the number of informal procedures handled in 2011 was 99, which is also a substantial increase compared to previous years. In such cases the Ombudsman asks the Commission to reply directly to citizens without analysing the substance of the reply.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank the Ombudsman for holding conferences and for organising very broad public consultations on public service principles, to which we also contributed through the written contribution of the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like also to confirm that we value and apply those principles. Even if the Staff Regulations already impose the strongest of rules for EU officials and the Commission is committed to the highest ethical values which guide its administration in contacts with the public and respects the code of good administrative conduct, we will also apply these principles across the Commission. They have been distributed to all our officials and have been posted on our internal and external websites.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to conclude by stressing once again that the Commission looks forward very much to continuing the useful and very fruitful cooperation with the Ombudsman, Parliament and the Petitions Committee.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, firstly, I would like to thank the European Ombudsman for his good work and especially for his cooperative work with the Committee on Petitions. The figures you quote in your annual report send a clear message: in 2011, 2 510 complaints were registered and 2 544 were processed. It was striking for me to see the relatively small number of inadmissible complaints, since in the Committee on Petitions we are attempting to improve that ratio. Congratulations on these figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">The figures prove to me that the institution of European Ombudsman is an important building block of transparency and democratic control in the European Union. The European Ombudsman provides people in the European Union with someone to turn to if they feel unfairly treated by the European institutions, thereby making a significant contribution to making Europe more tangible and intelligible for our citizens. We must also make it clear that the European Ombudsman is no paper tiger: he asks tough questions and does not soften his stance, even if the process takes longer. I would not go so far as to say that the Commission quakes in its boots before the European Ombudsman, but there is mutual respect. This is a good way of working that can be further cultivated.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am especially pleased that the cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman is so smooth. As is stated, the right of petition and the right to complain to the Ombudsman are complementary instruments. Normally – as we know in politics – complementary instruments can cause disputes over jurisdictions. The Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have no such disputes. You could say that our joint working motto could read: if in doubt, support the citizens of the European Union – and a good job, too!</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Diamandouros, I hope that we can continue this good work together – naturally, nothing is so good that it cannot be improved – and to that end, my best wishes for our cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros, the European Ombudsman, on a report which once again enjoys such considerable political support and recognition of the European Ombudsman’s contribution. It is rare to have such support and recognition from the Commission, which is one of the favourite targets of your investigations. I would also like to underline the contribution made by the European Ombudsman to improving the culture of good administration at both European and national level, and the excellent cooperation which has existed between you and the Committee on Petitions not just in 2011, but as a matter of routine over the past few years.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, our report says something which must concern us, Commissioner Šefčovič: 58 % of inquiries concern the European Commission. Furthermore, in 2012 there are still cases, including in the Committee on Petitions, which allege a lack of transparency and a lack of cooperation on the part of the European Commission in its dealings with European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I wish you success, Mr Diamandouros, and I hope you will have the same success in your efforts to persuade the national ombudsmen that they too have a fundamental duty to ensure that the Member States serve their own citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, on behalf of my entire political group I would like to thank the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and his entire office for their excellent work, particularly on behalf of transparency and of good administration within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Your office has published principles of good administration, for which we thank you; but at the same time it is, regrettably, necessary to rap the Commission’s knuckles. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, principles of good administration should have been drawn up for EU citizens, but unfortunately the Commission has failed to issue any such proposal. It is good that the Ombudsman has done so; however, these are principles, and are not binding in the way that a law on good administration would be.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I still hope that the Commission will issue a proposal on good administration before its work comes to an end, and that it will likewise issue a proposal on transparency. This proposal on increasing transparency that you requested in fact reduces transparency, or would have reduced transparency if it had entered into force. This is disgraceful. In the 2010s, the rules of transparency are different from what they were 10-20 years ago.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On behalf of my group I would ask the Commission to produce a law on good administration for Parliament and the Council in this matter, and also to improve transparency and to issue a new regulation on increased transparency.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, first and foremost, thank you to Ms Mazzoni for a good report, with regard to which I would particularly like to emphasise support for our Ombudsman’s desire to not simply produce a handbook, but a regulation through which we fulfil the pledges we have made to citizens in the treaties, and through which we improve the entire path, and we need EU institutions to act as a model for all our Member States now. Therefore, it is natural that we should have a regulation. In connection with this, I would also once again like to express my thanks for the fact that the report provides clear support, which is also very apparent in Mr Diamandouros’s review here: that what must be introduced now is the so-called service principle or the ‘culture of service’, where the considerations of citizens are at the centre and where citizens are not considered opponents against which protection must be sought, but rather as people who should be served. A little more often than I would like, I have encountered a culture within the Commission where citizens are the enemy, and we must get away from that. I was glad that Mr Šefčovič said a few well-chosen words about this; however, we cannot live off words alone; we want action. I would also like to emphasise in connection with this that having competent officials with self-respect is absolutely the best way because it gives us one of the best ways of tackling corruption, for corruption is closely linked to corrupt administrations, and these administrations must be lifted up towards self-respect, openness, transparency and a good culture. We must have a good regulation.</p>
      <p sl="da">Allow me to use my final minutes to consider another matter: We have discussed the very high number of complaints for some countries compared with others. We see the same thing in the Committee on Petitions. Allow me to now say: I think we should interpret this as a good sign if a country has active citizens who participate and come to us. It is not necessarily a sign that there is something very wrong in the society concerned; on the contrary, we could praise the society and say: ‘Look! Here is a strong civil society! We will support this!’ Therefore, it is not just a question of coming forward with complaints; on the contrary: let us help each other. Thank you, Mr President! And thank you, Ms Mazzoni.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Ms Mazzoni, Chair of the Committee on Petitions, for her report, on which we are going to vote in favour. It is a good report, which comprehensively covers each and every one of the subjects covered in the Annual Report of the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, whom we also thank for all his administration and work.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that you are going to have a great deal of work to do and we should all help to bring the institutions closer to the public and resolve the problems, because all the complaints that you are going to receive are going to relate to the current European production model, which is entirely unsupportive and unsustainable. As a result, millions of people are suffering pain and humiliation, do not have jobs, are falling into poverty and are having their homes taken from them. There is no doubt that in this type of crisis we all need to make a contribution towards being much more diligent and urging the Commission to be more transparent, so that swift responses can be given to those who are having a very difficult time across the EU.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I am particularly pleased that while representing the newest wing of Parliament, I find that there is complete unanimity in recognising Mr Diamandouros’s work and his excellent cooperation with the Committee on Petitions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Praise is due to Mr Diamandouros, who worthily represents and serves an institution that contributes to the qualitative improvement of EU administration and the safeguarding of European citizens’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">According to the Ombudsman’s report, 2 510 petitions were registered in 2011, and the institution directly assisted more than 22 000 citizens. This is an excellent record, but I think this important institution should, in an appropriate way, be made more widely known to EU citizens, bearing in mind that 42 % of European citizens, according to a Eurobarometer report, are not satisfied with transparency in the EU administration. This is a necessary institution and its operation has so far been successful.</p>
      <p sl="el">As happens every year, of course, most of the inquiries conducted by the Ombudsman concerned the European Commission – about 58 % – and it is especially important that suitable measures should be designed to strengthen cooperation with the Commission in the interests of European citizens. Particularly in this difficult time of crisis for institutions and democratic values, I congratulate Mr Diamandouros on the excellent way in which he is performing his duties, just as I congratulate Ms Mazzoni, Chair of the Committee on Petitions, who facilitates good cooperation between the two bodies. I will also take this opportunity to sound an optimistic note and say that the crisis will pass. We need to restore citizens’ confidence in institutions and in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Ombudsman, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Ms Mazzoni shows that we should thank the Ombudsman for his work in the service of European citizens and for his cooperation with the European Parliament, especially the Committee on Petitions. I can point to a very precise example, which has struck me: in addition to about 1 800 ongoing petitions, in the Committee on Petitions we have to produce a special report regarding complaints against the Commission. I have established that, in the last 16 years, this very special instrument has been used only 18 times. This proves how accurately and objectively the Ombudsman and his team carry out their work.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, I would like to point out two aspects I have noticed along the way. The first relates to the publicity work for the work of the Ombudsman, which could do with a boost. It seems to me that the 27 % of petitions processed that actually fell within his jurisdiction indicate, if we revert the argument, that almost three quarters of the petitions do not, and that it would be worthwhile raising people’s awareness here. On that point, in Austria the Ombudsmen broadcast on public television.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point, regarding which I would be happy if in the next report progress were to be announced, is the Regulation on General Administrative Procedures. I would be happy to see binding minimum standards applied to the entire administration of the EU. I know that the Ombudsman is very active in this area. My best wishes for our – and especially his – continued, successful work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Ombudsman’s 2011 report focuses on supporting people directly, informing citizens and other interested parties, cooperating with national ombudsmen, implementing simplified procedures which are more accessible to citizens, and achieving results to the benefit of complainants.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In 2011 the Ombudsman helped more than 22 000 citizens, of whom 2 510 submitted complaints, 1 284 requested information and more than 18 000 obtained advice through the interactive guide on the Ombudsman’s website. In over 65 % of the complaints dealt with in 2011, citizens’ rights were upheld by opening inquiries into cases, transferring cases to another competent body or signposting people to the institution that they needed to approach. I welcome the fact that approximately 61 % of complaints received in 2011 were submitted using the internet and more than half of the internet submissions were received through the electronic complaints form on the Ombudsman’s website.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite considerable progress in recent years, the proportion of processed complaints which actually fell within the Ombudsman’s remit in 2011 was once again relatively low. In my view attention should be given to a more comprehensive raising of public awareness, particularly in close cooperation with national and regional Ombudsmen and with Parliament and the European Commission, of the scope of responsibility of the Ombudsman. I am appealing to him in future to watch over the best possible utilisation of funds, and to work with other EU institutions. I fully support the Ombudsman’s view that the principles of good administration go further than the law and require the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies not only to respect their legal obligations, but also to be service-minded and to ensure that members of the public are properly treated and enjoy their rights fully.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the report on the activities of the Ombudsman and recognise the important role played by this office in promoting the integrity of European public administration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clouds of doubt have recently been cast over the institutions regarding what the media have termed ‘Dalligate’, or the resignation of former Commissioner Dalli. Speaking at the Committee on Budgets last year, Commissioner Šemeta emphasised, in his proposals for a more efficient OLAF, the importance of certain procedural rights contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights being protected in the course of OLAF investigations. Given this, I would like to know if the Ombudsman intends to investigate the circumstances surrounding the OLAF report into the issues surrounding the Tobacco Directive, as certainly there seem to be serious questions surrounding the procedural integrity of the whole process. I wish to thank the Ombudsman for being here.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Ms Mazzoni on her work on this very detailed report, and Mr Diamandouros on his work in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also welcome the fact that the total number of complaints submitted has gradually decreased. Furthermore, the Ombudsman has succeeded in dealing with the majority of cases of maladministration in the work of EU institutions. In addition, I believe that the fact that the Ombudsman is striving to reduce even further the number of complaints which do not lie within his remit is to be appreciated. The information provided to this end is clear and precise and is intended to guide complainants in the right direction. At the same time, the new approach is also intended to change the procedures, to make them much more accessible to citizens. At the same time, I would like to welcome the fact that there is close cooperation between the Ombudsman and similar bodies in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would really like to show my appreciation and thank you once again for your good cooperation with the Ombudsman and with the Committee on Petitions, because it helps us to strive towards our very important goal, which is to offer a genuine culture of service from the European public administration to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we look at the statistics we see that the number of complaints is going down. I would also like to assure you that good administrative behaviour and respect for these very important principles is something which is very important to us and is part of our everyday work.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were a lot of comments concerning the transparency of the Commission. I agree with you that we can always do better, and I am sure that we will do better next year than we have this year. But I am still convinced that the European civil service and the European Commission is one of the most transparent public administrations you can find in Europe and in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">How are we going to improve our quality of work? We will continue with very intense internal training of our officials. We will be constantly increasing awareness of the importance of respect for the principles of good administrative behaviour and transparency. We are increasing the use of informal procedures, which very often help us to find amicable solutions without an unnecessary bureaucratic burden. We are looking harder for amicable solutions, and here we get very good advice from the Ombudsman. Good cooperation with you and with the good offices of the Ombudsman helps us to improve our work in this particular respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the area of transparency, here also over the course of the last couple of years a considerable effort has been made, and I think that together we have accomplished a great deal. For example, our joint transparency register is something which is not often found in the capitals of different countries in the world. I think there is something comparable in Washington, and now we have something similar in Vienna. We can see how this transparency register is working and attracting more and more companies to be registered.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am fully aware that I would need the support of Parliament and of civil society to encourage the participation of, for example, law firms. We will very soon see how we want to tackle this issue in the report which we are preparing in which we will assess how the transparency register works. We are much more transparent than before with regard to the comitology register, showing how the expert groups are composed, their agendas and the results of their deliberations. We publish the minutes of their discussions, and this also compares very well with similar situations in most of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time the statistic produced by Eurobarometer is a very correct one, showing the importance of transparency and how European citizens are very often disappointed. But at the same time we should also be also proud – both Parliament and the Commission – that we are among the most trusted institutions in the European Union. If we compare, in this time of crisis, how many citizens trust the EU, the European Parliament and the Commission, I think that the percentage in many cases would be quite significantly higher than for trust in the national institutions. This is something which has to be remembered as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the situation of Mr Dalli – and I am sure that the Ombudsman will respond to specific questions – I would just like to reassure all of you that in the conclusions of the OLAF investigations it was very clear that his services were cleared by the OLAF report. There was no impact whatsoever on the good functioning and efficient handling of the files by the DGs. This also applies to the Tobacco Directive. I would also like to reassure you, as I did two days ago, that the Tobacco Directive will be proposed without any delay. I hope that the hearing for the new Commissioner is now some two or three weeks away. I would like to assure this House that the Tobacco Directive will be ruled on by this Parliament in the current electoral period. I believe that, after we submit the proposal to you, you will all agree that it is a very ambitious one which is very important for the health of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me thank all the Members of Parliament who have taken the floor and who have been good enough to speak well of the work of the European Ombudsman. We are profoundly appreciative of your support and are cognisant of the fact that your support and your good work increase the responsibilities that lie on our shoulders to be able to continue to do things better and work together with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament with a view to serving citizens even better. I am very grateful for that and for your encouragement.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of MEPs raised the question of the low number of complainants and the high number of inadmissibles – Mr Jahr, Mr Becker and Mr Wałęsa. I think the important point to repeat again is that, because of the interactive guide we introduced three years ago on our website, we have now had the good result of people coming to us for the right reasons rather than the wrong reasons. This Parliament had for years been insisting that we should try to bring down the number of inadmissibles. We have done it. We have done it very significantly. I just want to say that in fact this is one of the things for which we are grateful to Parliament for suggesting that we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Boştinaru, I want to thank you very much for your comments and your support. As you know, the ‘déformation professionnelle’ of the Ombudsman is to try to be fair, and in all fairness it is important for me to say that it is indeed the case that the Commission has the largest number of complaints – as the Commissioner said, it also accounts for 65 % of all EU civil servants – but, if you look at the star cases that the Ombudsman produced last year (ten in all), five star cases for exemplary performance went to the Commission. So we do have problems where we criticise the Commission, and we work with the Commissioner to be able to rectify maladministration, but we also have to acknowledge the areas where they actually do try, and they do very good work there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Auken, I am very grateful to you. You know where I stand on the issue of the regulation. I was in Mrs Jäätteenmäki’s home country and in your home country only two weeks ago and I had occasion to speak with Mrs Astola of the Finnish Ministry of Justice precisely about how we can promote this kind of regulation on EU administrative law and how to serve citizens better.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to congratulate Mrs Prendergast first of all on the decision of her own Parliament in Ireland yesterday significantly to expand the mandate of the Irish Ombudsman and to add 140 new bodies to her remit. This was a long-overdue reform and I can only applaud it, as a colleague, and convey, through you, our happiness that this is the case. Concerning your question, Mrs Prendergast, on the Tobacco Directive, the answer is that the European Ombudsman, to date, has not received any complaint concerning the directive. If we were to receive a complaint, of course we would have to ensure that before coming to us the complainants had addressed OLAF as the appropriate body for ensuring that the appropriate measures had been complied with – or any other kind of EU institution that might be involved, in this particular case the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like once again to acknowledge Commissioner Šefčovič’s continuing offer regarding good administration. We take it very seriously, we rely on it, we look forward to working with you and I very much assure you that we have taken note of the increase in the cooperation of the Commission in finding, through informal procedures, friendly solutions which are good for you, good for us and, above all, good for the citizen.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I really appreciated this evening’s debate. I feel it was a practical example of how we can create good civic cooperation networks which can produce results. The speeches by all members of the Committee on Petitions have shown how widely accepted the analysis of the European Ombudsman’s work is and, more importantly, how broad is the support for the objectives of that work.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is undoubtedly a kind of synergy and osmosis between the two bodies, which makes it easier for us to share one another’s best practices. We will therefore be attempting to copy the Ombudsman’s experience of putting his services online in order to move closer to citizens, if not physically, at least through the new technologies available, and also to be more efficient. The Ombudsman will certainly be drawing closer to us too, as he has done at other times, by supporting the petitions of citizens that have been forwarded to the Ombudsman in error and that actually fall within the Committee on Petitions’ remit. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Ombudsman who, correctly and appropriately as always, reiterated the prerogatives of the Committee on Petitions by crucially referring back to us some complaints, or I think perhaps it was one complaint, made by a citizen about the conduct of the Committee on Petitions, which I represent, thereby giving further confirmation of the straightforwardness and transparency of our relations.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am very grateful to Commissioner Šefčovič for his timely presence here, for the hard work he does every day, and I have no doubt that the wishes he has expressed are extremely sincere and that they are also achievable as far as he is concerned. Sadly, over the years I have noticed that, despite its good intentions, the Commission is still slow to adapt to the genuine need for greater simplification, greater immediacy, and a closer relationship that are expressed by citizens in the complaints received each day by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. It is about this not particularly positive fact that I plead for the hundredth time with Commissioner Šefčovič, who I know is committed to looking after the interests of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First of all I would like to pass on my congratulations on the level of detail in the report by Ms Mazzoni. In the last two years the European Ombudsman has made promising progress towards ensuring that its activity becomes transparent and understandable for EU citizens. I feel we must not lose sight of this trend, especially now that the European Year of Citizens is approaching. However, it is worthwhile emphasising that while the Treaty of Lisbon armed the world of direct democracies with new rights, notably citizens’ initiatives, we have to be careful with the critical powers regarding freedom of information. As I urged in my speech last October, in terms of access to information we must respect the fact that information can arise in relation to law enforcement, security and defence policy that guarantees the security of European citizens because it is confidential – therefore greater access cannot be called for in connection with classified information, especially not in the spirit of political marketing. At the same time, what is important and indeed exemplary from the report’s perspective is if the Ombudsman undertakes to ensure that institutions and institutional practices change and develop in line with the needs and efforts of citizens to a certain extent. It would be ideal if we were able to handle all the problems where they occur, based on clear and transparent standards. We hope that the Ombudsman intends to carry out his tasks in view of these considerations and with an open mind to the needs of society.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-526-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly I would like to say that the European Commission agrees with many points of the present European Parliament’s draft resolution on Russia’s accession to the WTO. Although the WTO accession process of Russia was long, the results are impressive. Our exporters will now find it easier to access Russian markets. Reductions in customs duties will mean savings of EUR 2.5 billion a year. Our services industries will also have easier access – particularly in finance, telecommunications and retail. Moving goods across the border will be eased with the new rules on customs valuation, fees and transit procedures. Russian export duties on many raw materials have been capped and will be reduced for key inputs like wood, and we will have a more predictable regulatory environment for our investment in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, Russia has taken a number of protectionist measures that cause great concern – both in terms of Russia’s willingness to play by the rules of the WTO and of their significant negative impact on the EU economy. For example, Russia’s decision on levying so-called ‘recycling fees’ on imported vehicles is problematic, because it discriminates against European producers and infringes the most basic WTO rules, and duties on cars are now higher than before Russia’s WTO accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia’s ban on live pig imports is a clear case of a regulatory measure acting as a tool of trade protection, lacking any valid scientific basis, and is disproportionate to the issues it seeks to address.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have identified a list of more than 300 products with discrepancies between the applied import duties and the agreed tariffs in the WTO, and in most cases giving least-favourable treatment to EU exporters in sectors like paper, agriculture, automotive products and textiles. Lastly, the preferential export duties for our wood imports from Russia agreed upon prior to WTO accession are still not in place. We will start by trying to find agreed solutions, failing which we will not hesitate to enforce our WTO rights if they are violated.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission takes note of the European Parliament’s Policy Study on Russia’s WTO accession, which correctly concludes that membership of the WTO is only a starting point for the sustained and diversified growth of the Russian economy. What is needed is a thorough reform of the domestic economy and business environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only Russia can choose to pursue such a reform, but the EU is willing to help through a new framework agreement. In this context, the European Commission is not asking for new market access commitments. However, there is scope to break new ground on a range of regulatory issues, and Europe has one of the world’s most advanced regulatory regimes and useful experience to share.</p>
      <p sl="en">This agenda is complicated by the creation of a customs union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The European Commission’s priority remains to develop our bilateral trade relations with Russia first, as it is the only WTO member among these three countries, and the political situation in Belarus remains a serious matter of concern.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Russia is actually the only large neighbour that we have. There is also an interdependence between the European Union and Russia, particularly in the field of trade and energy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However – as the Commissioner has just said – the trading relations are certainly not the best. The reason for this is that up to now Russia has only operated in accordance with its own rules and that is often a source of very great frustration for the European business community. I have today seen in the business ranking published by the World Bank that Russia is only in 112th place. That is because it is very difficult to do business with Russia. That is the very reason that the accession of Russia to the WTO is a very good development that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) also welcome and set down in a resolution accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nevertheless, Madam President, we must check whether all the agreements made are observed. Allow me to make a couple of comments in that regard. If we wish to use the potential of economic relations with Russia to the full then we must also ensure that Russia complies with all its obligations in the framework of the WTO. In the run-up to the accession there are still very many things that give me cause for concern, such as protectionist measures, unilateral, temporary tariff increases, and the production and sale of counterfeit goods. These aspects have now been named and we must keep an eye on them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Accession to the WTO is an unbelievably important step but there are other specific issues that the EU and Russia must settle at bilateral level. These matters will soon be dealt with in the Swoboda report in which, as today, we must ask for attention to be paid by the departments concerned to ensuring that the negotiations, also regarding a partnership agreement, will again run smoothly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation at the end of 11 years of negotiations offers a new perspective for its relationship with the European Union, which thus far has been characterised by asymmetrical trade. Russia has undertaken to align its trade rules and practices with WTO standards, in particular with regard to non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies and improving intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that Russia’s efforts in this direction are substantial, and that the implementation of these commitments as swiftly as possible will facilitate trade with WTO member states, encourage the creation of new jobs and contribute to an increase in Russia’s GDP. At the same time, the decision to join an international trade organisation means not only benefits, but also compliance with rules established by mutual agreement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For that reason, arbitrary measures such as banning imports of animals originating from the European Union must be avoided in future. It must also be borne in mind that the negotiations on a new agreement between the European Union and Russia will gravitate towards the WTO obligations assumed by both parties, and are a good opportunity to lay down common principles and objectives in the area of trade.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To this end, I support the inclusion in the new agreement of a substantial and legally binding chapter on energy in order to create a transparent and non-discriminatory energy market, and a chapter on sustainable development through which we encourage Russia to respect both human and workers’ rights and also international environmental standards.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Not least, the Member States should draw up a list of common interests so that they will be approached in a concerted manner during future negotiations with the Russian Federation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, while Russia and the European Union enjoy a very intertwined and intense relationship and today we are not only neighbours, but fortunately we are friends, the Liberals and Democrats also welcome the accession of Russia to the WTO after eighteen years of negotiations. It was high time indeed. I think it is good news for Russia but also for the European Union. Why? Because we can hope for a relationship based on clear rules and clear applicability. If we look at what happened to China after it joined the WTO, we can see that the growth and the success story of China really began with that date a few years ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">So I hope this will happen for Russia as well and that Russia can also envisage an extreme success story after the significant date in August this year. But I would also like to raise two concerns, two challenges. One has already been mentioned by Mr Sefčovič and other colleagues, and that is that Russia does not seem to be willing to live up 100 % to its obligations which come with the accession to the WTO but is instead undertaking some extensive and potentially restrictive trade measures like the examples which have already been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point I would like to make is that we have to look at the business environment in Russia. Russia has always been a very proud nation with a rich culture, with inventions and esprit ; Nobel Prize winners and astronauts have come from Russia. We all know about these important landmarks in Russian history. But why is it that today – apart from maybe vodka, caviar and Gazprom – we do not really know of any Russian brands? Why is it that they do not really thrive? Why are there not Russian success stories? I think this has to do with the applicability of the rule of law and human rights, and I think it is good that it has been raised in our resolution. It comes in a timely manner, because next week we go to Moscow and can discuss it there.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Green Group and the Pirate Party welcome the participation of Russia in multilateral trade forums, and we see it as an important step that Russia has joined the World Trade Organisation. However, we believe that proper time must be given to Russia to implement the WTO requirements before we start talking about further bilateral negotiations on a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree that there is reason to remain vigilant on the Eurasian Customs Union, but we cannot automatically assume it is incompatible with Russia’s WTO obligations. Our group filed a number of amendments for which I would like to ask your support. In particular we would like to rethink the wisdom of paragraph 11, last indent, regarding pre-establishment investment protection and to request support for our Amendment 8. Russia has for a long time been the only country with a reasonably well-developed information and communications infrastructure that has not been subject to the TRIPS agreement requirements. This has led to interesting developments in the field of content distribution in Russia, not only in illegal downloading – a topic which we discuss with far too much aggression too frequently in our House – but also in distribution schemes that are, or were at the time of their emergence, legal under the Russian system.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time the Russian authorities appeared to have no regard for freedom of communication or freedom of information flows. At least once during my time of political involvement, Russian authorities have casually shut down legal online distribution services at the request of foreign entities to accommodate the advancement of World Trade Organisation discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be a shame if the TRIPS implementation chosen by Russia turned out to hinder rather than foster the previously-mentioned spirit of solutions for online distribution for the future. And there is good reason for the European Union to keep a close watch on the implementation of the TRIPS obligations in Russia. They establish a basis for economic interaction which depends completely on an administrative right, a monopoly granted by the government and its legal institutions to private parties. Are we confident that the Russian administration is consistent enough to provide such a basis?</p>
      <p sl="en">In the field of copyright in particular, the TRIPS agreement and the present interpretation adopted by the disputes settlement body of the Berne three-step test should cause us to feel concern for how future implementation of Russian copyright will relate to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Already at European level we are suffering from inconsistencies with the application of notice and take-down orders.</p>
      <a text="(The President requested the speaker to speak more slowly)"/>
      <p sl="en">One of the concerns raised in the European Union by many stakeholders is that notice and take-down requests risk imposing arbitrary restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of expression in the Member States. Similar objections have been raised in Spain and France in the implementation of laws that grant rightholders the power to request the take-down of a web page through administrative requests rather than judicial process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The TRIPS agreement does not establish any boundaries for enforcement. In theory it can be extended as far and as arbitrarily as a signatory party wants it to be extended. Therefore we have to ask ourselves whether or not the situation in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of expression will be affected by the implementation of TRIPS in Russia. Given our experiences in Europe, we need to keep a close eye on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also have the opportunity to revisit the question of the monitoring of communications. The situation in many European jurisdictions with the Data Retention Directive and in terms of intermediary liability for intellectual property rights infringements is uncertain. Also in Russia there are extensive obligations on telecommunications providers and service providers to monitor the communications of their users. We have every reason to be vigilant so that the situation in Russia does not deteriorate with respect to the monitoring of communications.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of access control and allegedly illegal content on line, the issue of blocking access to specific content has already been debated many times and by many people in the Member States and here in Parliament, but these proposals also exist in Russia, again with the higher risk of arbitrary application and again with a broader scope than we would normally find in Europe. If the European Union wishes to see the implementation of human rights, freedom of speech, free journalism and a free press in Russia, it will be important for us to establish – firstly for ourselves – open norms for free communication.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, Ms Oomen-Ruijten was right to say that in the World Bank index, Russia occupies 120th place where ease of doing business is concerned. We hope that Russia’s entry into the World Trade Organisation will put this situation right and make the country more business-friendly because, to put it simply, Russians deserve this. Commissioner Šefčovič spoke of this protectionalism, or protectionism, which we fear. We have several other concerns as well, but I think we are engaging in cooperation, and we have facilitated Russia’s accession to the WTO precisely in order to combat this protectionism, and to give Russia a chance to have a liberal, free-market economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am also pleased by the response from Mr Cutaş, who pointed out that we do not want a certain discrimination in the scope of energy supplies and diversification in this area to continue; but I am pleased too that Mr Cutaş and the representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance mentioned the subject of human rights, because we are actually expecting … I can see the Russian Federation representative in the gallery. Please would you convey to your nation that we are glad that you are in the WTO, and we would like you to be as wealthy a society as can be, enjoying all of the benefits that the societies and nations of the European Union enjoy. We would like to see you wealthy, democratic and free. Please pass this on to your country’s authorities, but please also pass it on to the people of the Russian Federation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, as we discuss – not for the first time – the accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the Russian Federation, it is easy to forget that trade with the Russian Federation is, and in my opinion will continue to be, of strategic relevance to Europe because there is so much of it and because of the direction it is taking.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to respond to the report by Mr Sturdy, since he examines the status of the relationship with the Russian Federation from economic perspectives, taking Russia’s accession to the WTO, after years of negotiation, as the reference point. I am grateful to the permanent rapporteur for trade negotiations with the Russian Federation for not allowing himself to ignore troubling news about social conflicts, increasingly arbitrary behaviour by the authorities and new, ambivalent legal situation in Russia, but for sticking soberly to the facts.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are policy areas that cannot just be subsumed under the logic and dynamism of foreign policy. We have talked about this here several times before. Parliament should also form policy with a view to economic cooperation and create trade relations independently of political trends. I welcome the fact that the Commission representatives here in Parliament recently made a commitment to guarantee the stability of this relationship and, as a consequence, to take the Russian leadership at its word regarding the modernisation of the country and its interest in having the EU at its side as a partner.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the major lessons of the earlier conflicts in Europe is that rapprochement brings change. Mutual rapprochement works in the 21st century but only on an equal footing and through joint efforts. Trade is not an instrument for this rapprochement but does have exactly this effect. This change, which, along with further economic cooperation, we feel is justified, should have as its aim a movement towards greater social justice, less poverty, greater democracy, obviously greater rule of law and thus respect for human rights. We know that the rule of law without democracy – or vice versa – does not work. However, greater democracy without greater social justice, greater application of trade union rights, international labour norms, environmental standards, etc. is even worse. This also applies to the serious consideration of the impacts of the Russian Federation’s accession to the WTO, which in the medium term are not easy to predict, on jobs in industry, the service sector and elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we should also take a fresh look at trade barriers. What is really preventing trade with Russia at present is not only trade barriers as we define them but also the continued existence of the visa requirement. The statements at the EU-Russia summit in this regard read well but have not added anything of substance yet. We ought to change this.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Commissioner, the accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) means that from now on our bilateral trade will be bound by international multilateral rules and obligations. Therefore, we should perceive this change as a good momentum to intensify dialogue on several issues that we have so far failed to resolve satisfactorily in bilateral negotiations. For example, we may expect that, when complying with WTO trade rules, Russia may proceed to restrict export duties and reduce import duties, and will also provide better access to service providers from abroad to the Russian market and simplify procedures in bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The greater openness of Russia’s vast market space for our producers in the engineering, automotive, consumer, textile, pharmaceutical and food industries can only help to reinvigorate our still sluggish economy. Therefore, we should not hesitate too long with our initiatives because the Americans, the Chinese and the Japanese are certainly interested in using the new more favourable conditions for mutually beneficial business cooperation with Russia and they will seek to find more stable moorings for their companies in the large Russian market. There is an opportunity here to improve business collaboration and it is up to us how effectively we are able to make use of this today for the development of the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although since August Russia has been a member of the World Trade Organisation, and this is to be welcomed, we must nonetheless acknowledge that unfortunately it is not meeting its commitments. Russia is continuing to implement measures that are restrictive of trade. Here we should mention, for example, the ban on importing animals from the European Union, a legislative measure that discriminates against foreign nationals in the sphere of public procurement, a seasonal import duty on sugar, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Russia must take urgent measures in the sphere of intellectual property protection. It is still continuing to both produce and sell counterfeit products. Not enough work is being done to combat corruption. Significant reforms are still needed. It is very important to stress that Russia has practically suspended work on the new partnership and cooperation agreement. This agreement is extremely important: it must be detailed and legally binding, and must include European requirements on standards; it must establish a legally binding energy section, consolidating a non-discriminatory and transparent energy market. In view of the fact that approximately 75 % of investment in Russia comes directly from the European Union, it is important to ensure that our investors are protected, by holding talks on a bilateral investment agreement.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Nine years have now passed since Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s arrest and the start of the Yukos trial. The fact that this case is ongoing shows that in Russia the rule of law can for the moment only be seen as a goal, but we must do everything possible to achieve this goal. Finally, I would like to stress that treaties and agreements must be adhered to. Our task is to ensure that our partner, Russia, does so. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, WTO membership can definitely support the urgently needed modernisation of the Russian economy, through easing technology transfer and improving investment security – these are just two examples. It is just two years since Russia agreed on a partnership for modernisation with the EU for the same reasons; the declared aims of this partnership include the alignment of technical standards, the extension of investment opportunities in key sectors for innovation and growth and the general strengthening of trade relations – all these are improved by WTO accession.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, successful accession to the WTO may perhaps merely give Russia more of a voice in other international bodies. Russia will only benefit from membership of it actually implements the joint agreement on trade facilitation. A partnership with the EU for modernisation only makes sense if Russia complies with its WTO obligations. Cherry picking, WTO à la carte – there are so many pleasing expressions for what we can to some extent still see Russia doing, what Russia is doing with its membership at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU advocated for a long time that Russia should at last be a member of the World Trade Organisation and we will prove a reliable partner to our Russian friends in the future, but this relationship cannot function in one direction only. Even the joint project, which has already taken so long, i.e. the joint partnership agreement, can now be facilitated through the WTO accession on either side, since the rules no longer have to be negotiated – they are established. However – there are two conditions: the Russians must really comply, and the EU cannot pile on more conditions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, well done to Russia for its accession to the World Trade Organisation, and I agree with the various boundaries set and the guidance given in the resolution. As a member of the delegation to the EU-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia, I would like to add something else that has not yet been mentioned in this debate, namely that Russia has made an effort to redraft its position both with respect to the WTO, and therefore the international community and particularly the Western nations and, through the Customs Union, with respect to the Eurasian countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe we need to think carefully about the compatibility of the WTO and Russia’s accession to it, the new bilateral agreement being negotiated with Russia by the EU, and the Customs Union. I think this is one of the most complicated aspects. We do not yet know how the Customs Union will evolve, or whether as expected it will lead to a common economic area based on the four freedoms of movement that exist in the EU, but I believe that we should be taking an integrated approach to Russia on the one hand and Central Asia on the other. There is no point in creating antagonism between these two areas, bearing in mind the umbilical cord that links Russia with Central Asia.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, we need to try to ensure that the Customs Union’s standards as regards safety and anti-trust rules are still in line with European standards, and I am also wondering what good the abolition of the visa system will do in these negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I very much welcome Russia joining the WTO. I think the issue, though, is about whether Russia successfully adopts WTO procedures. What does joining the WTO actually mean in practice? The official commitments include non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, reducing tariffs and binding tariff levels, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights and foregoing the use of local content requirements and other investment measures which limit imports. It also requires them to open government procurement contract opportunities to foreign firms and to accept that the WTO will settle trade dispute procedures. That is quite a long list for Russia to sign up to.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is quite a challenge for Russia. For example, Russia has export duties on no less than 450 types of products at the moment, and duties will be reduced from 19 % to an average of 8 %. Russia is still a tough place to do business. It is ranked 120 in the world ‘ease of doing business’ rankings, and Putin called the accession process to the WTO an ambush of Russian economic interests. So I very much welcome the move towards the WTO, but there are some tough challenges ahead.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I believe that the proposed resolution faithfully reflects the European Union’s current approach to Russia. This approach is in many ways forthcoming, and in this case welcomes Russia’s accession to the WTO. As usual, however, the suggested resolution lists the homework for others, i.e. for Russia, and says very little of what we are going to do to improve relations.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that the resolution in its current form means that once again we will miss the opportunity to state that we consider the earliest possible lifting of visa requirements between Russia and the European Union to be important for an improvement in trade and political relations. Abstract references to ongoing negotiations are insufficient. For me, the European Parliament’s own initiative is missing, and I fear that there is also a lack of understanding of the significance of this intention.</p>
      <p sl="cs">At the same time it is unclear to me why it states in paragraph 16 of the motion for a resolution that the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus Customs Union should impose additional barriers to trade with Russia. It is obvious that such a barrier would be inconsistent with WTO rules and Russia’s newly adopted commitments. However, we can also say that the said Customs Union will remove barriers and will extend the WTO rules to other areas. I cannot help but feel that the aforementioned expression of concern is an expression of political resistance to the ongoing integration process in the post-Soviet space, rather than an expression of interest in the implementation of the WTO objectives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wholeheartedly support the Commission’s endeavours to create a more predictable and transparent regulatory environment in mutual trade. The EU has consistently supported Russia’s membership of the WTO and its explanations that it would commit its authorities to obey the rules of international trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the past ten months have not been particularly encouraging. Therefore I think it is important to formulate a clear and comprehensive EU position to indicate that this time we expect Moscow to live up to its commitments. We should not waste any time in doing this. Let us be under no illusions. The pattern in Russia has thus far been a selective one, mostly insisting on exceptions when it is in Russia’s particular interests. The Energy Charter Treaty has been a notorious example.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia’s commitments to the WTO provide for the substantial lowering of tariffs in goods and services and the elimination by Moscow of the dual pricing of goods, as well as clarification of the terms of establishment of services companies, investment protection and avoiding discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have two suggestions for the Commission. The EU clearly has to indicate that full compliance with the WTO rules will be a precondition for continuing negotiations for a new EU-Russia trade treaty. Secondly, the Commission should use EU technologies, standards and conformity assessment procedures in forthcoming negotiations, insisting that our counterparts accommodate themselves to EU rules, which are anyway in harmony with the WTO rules.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, after a long period of negotiations, Russia has finally become a member of the World Trade Organisation. This should increase Russian GDP growth, accelerate the joint EU-Russia modernisation programme, assist the creation and retention of jobs both in Russia and in the EU Member States, and allow implementation of higher environmental protection standards. The accession has removed an important barrier in negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia. However, Russia must coherently implement its assumed obligations, further liberalise its trade regime and create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and foreign investment. WTO membership prohibits the worsening of trade conditions based on political motives or the interests of lobby groups. It is important that when the Russian Government reduces import tariffs, it does not artificially raise other taxes or introduce new ones. EU-Russia cooperation following Russia’s accession to the WTO must also encourage neighbouring Belarus to integrate further with world trade. The European Union and Russia could help Belarus to implement WTO-compliant trade regulations more quickly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the EU has been a strong supporter of Russia’s WTO membership. We hoped that having the same rules would help boost economic relations with Russia and automatically resolve the issue of the current trade barriers. It seemed to be a step forward in our relationship, the economic significance of which cannot be underestimated. The EU continues to be Russia’s main trading partner and also the biggest foreign investor in that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, looked at today, Russian accession has sadly not lived up to our expectations. Moreover, it seems that Russia has been increasing the number of protectionist measures and ignoring WTO rules and regulations. On 20 March this year, Russia decided to ban all imports of live animals from the EU, saying that the spread of the Schmallenberg virus made these imports too risky. This reason was immediately declared to be ‘disproportionate and not based on scientific evidence’. What is more, many live animals such as pigs are not affected by the virus at all. The real reason for such behaviour from the Russian side is the wish to implement protectionist measures because, starting from Russia’s accession to the WTO, the import duties for live pigs had to decrease from 40 % to 5 %.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite letters and consultations at the highest level, Russia has not agreed to lift the ban. This is an extremely important issue for Estonia, from where nearly 60 % of live pigs used to be exported to Russia. Therefore, before moving ahead with trade relations, the current restrictions and clear violations of WTO rules need to be solved as fast as possible. There is also a need to come up with measures to influence the Russian side to implement and respect the common WTO rules and not to take WTO as being à la carte .</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, after 18 years of negotiation, Russia has entered the World Trade Organisation. From the perspective of EU countries, this is an opportunity to develop more reliable trading relations with this partner. This is a massive concern for Poland, which has not infrequently been treated instrumentally by the Russian authorities, specifically in the commercial exchange sphere. We all remember the problems that arose with exports of Polish meat, fruit and vegetable products to Russia in the not-so-distant past. Now disputes will be adjudicated in an international forum.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The EU is the largest foreign investor in Russia, so the creation of effective mechanisms of mutual trade policy is essential to protect the interests of European business people. The accession of Russia to the WTO also means a range of relaxations as regards access to that market, such as a lowering of duty levels. Elements of control and enforcement of regulations will also be strengthened.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, the Russian President and government often criticise our EU third energy package, and Gazprom is unwilling to play according to its rules. What they say – and they have begun using this argument – is that the Energy Package is in breach of World Trade Organisation principles, and that it inhibits free trade. This is nonsense, as many expert appraisals have asserted – the third energy package is compliant with international law. It assigns the same rights and duties to European companies and to Russian companies. Gazprom benefits from the provisions of this third energy package, even though it is criticising it. The monopolist has increased its commercial activities in the EU and has purchased a number of European energy companies. It also derives benefits from WTO rules. Meanwhile, European businesses cannot count on equal treatment in Russia, a point that has been raised in our discussions. Because of corruption and a lack of rule-of-law governments in Russia, some of these businesses have been thrown out of Russia. BP is an example. Russia also frequently fails to observe WTO rules relating to equal treatment of operators.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems to me that at this time when we are negotiating a new understanding on partnership and cooperation we must attribute a great deal of weight to this and treat the fulfilment of Article 102, which Russia is accused of breaching, as an essential condition for the signing of a new partnership agreement. The EU must deploy all of its potential, along with the potential it has through the WTO, to oblige Moscow to act in accordance with the law. The same is also true of the antimonopoly accusation and the investigation which the European Union is conducting.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, in general it is good news that after all those years of negotiation Russia is acceding to the World Trade Organisation. It is good news for Russia and it is good news for the European Union, and I believe it is good news for Russia’s neighbours, for countries that are not in the European Union but are in the Eastern Partnership, for those countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union and now just want to enjoy normal relations with the Russian Federation, both political and commercial.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think it is worth devoting some attention to at least some of those countries. The first question that arises is that of Georgia. After the 2008 conflict, Georgia, following very strained relations, voiced many expressions of good will. The Georgian President abolished visas for Russian citizens and opened up the Georgian market to goods from Russia. I think it is high time for us to say that we – we, that is, meaning international society, we, the European Union, we, the European Parliament – expect Russia to take a similar stance where Russo-Georgian trade relations are concerned. Now, and particularly with Russia being a WTO member, there is no further justification for a ban on the importation of food products from Georgia into the Russian market. We must make it clear to our partners in Russia that this is what we expect. My expectation of the European Commission representatives is that they will strongly emphasise in talks with Russia that these WTO rules apply to all parties, and they also apply to Russia in its relations with its neighbours such as Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova. I hope that these relations will be built on the foundation of WTO principles.</p>

This cooperation must be based on transparency, equal access to the market, infrastructure and investment, and a legally binding framework guaranteeing the reliable and regular supply of energy to all Member States of the European Union, based on equal standards. I believe that the primary aim should be an open and transparent energy market between the European Union and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation will also facilitate the development of trade in the Black Sea region.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the European Union’s economic relations with Russia exactly nine years to the day when Mikhail Khodorkovsky was incarcerated. This is a symbol of the efficacy of our policy where Russia is concerned. Let us recall that it was predicated on the concept of an economic opening-up of the European Union to Russia, closer relations and allowing Russian investment in the European Union, especially where the energy sector that is so very important to the Russian budget is concerned. In exchange, we were supposed to bring about the modernisation of Russia and its democratisation. Let us draw up a balance sheet for this period. Russia today is a more authoritarian country than it was when it began negotiating with the WTO over membership. Russia today is a country that is far more dependent on raw materials exports, chiefly energy-related, than it was 10 to 15 years ago.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our policy brought about a fiasco and ended in failure. This is the time when we should be telling ourselves this clearly. It is good that Russia has entered the WTO, but now Russia is looking to a new agreement on cooperation and partnership with the European Union for further concessions from the EU which would cover the costs of accession to the World Trade Organisation. This demonstrates the attitude of the Russian authorities, who are genuinely expecting all the rest to adapt themselves to the drastic standards by which the Russian Federation is governed, rather than see Russia adapt to the standards of relations with the European Union or WTO membership. We must not forget this. We have many common interests, in the pursuit of which we need to cooperate, but where our interests clash, we must draw conclusions from this and be more assertive where the Russians are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we welcome Russia’s accession to the WTO, but let us not forget that today is the ninth anniversary of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s arrest. The Yukos case, in which Khodorkovsky’s oil company was essentially confiscated by the Russian Government, continues to cast a shadow over Russia’s efforts to reassure its new partners in the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Yukos case is one of many examples of Russia’s political use of justice, and that is why Russia still needs to show that it can be trusted as a commercial partner. Since Khodorkovsky’s arrest in 2003, there have been many other signs of Russia’s selective approach to the rule of law, especially in the commercial field. Russia is also prone to using its gas resources as a diplomatic weapon, and a current EU price-fixing inquiry aimed at Gazprom suggests that the Kremlin will continue to put its own interests above its international obligations. So, Russia is an important commercial partner for the EU, but it remains potentially unreliable.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about this interesting subject in this catch-the-eye procedure.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Madam President, the Commissioner summed up Russia’s accession to the WTO after 18 years pretty well, and his views were echoed by many speakers. His views could be summarised in two words: cautious optimism. Certainly there is cause for optimism. I feel that progress may be slow and that we may have to settle for the Macmillan maxim of two steps forward, one step backward.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Nevertheless, having the international standards of the WTO to deal with any disputes, etc. can only lead to progress. Particularly, I hope this will lead to the removal of trade-restrictive measures, especially on the importation of live animals and public procurement. Russia can be guaranteed that the EU will play by the rules. The question is: will Russia? Over to you, Mr Putin.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Russia’s entry to the World Trade Organisation is a good opportunity for it to boost its relationship with the European Union. The WTO offers the best framework for the development of trade between the two parties.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, Russia must endeavour to integrate fully into the WTO and to comply more with the organisation’s rules. I am particularly concerned about Russia’s decision to ban imports of some live animals from the European Union. This measure was not taken on the basis of detailed analysis and breaches WTO rules. In addition, I note that there are still barriers for European companies when it comes to the award of public procurement contracts.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Russia must be more open in its trade relationship with the Union, as the consolidation of trade within the WTO is to the advantage of both parties.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation serves Russia’s own interests and also the interests of the European and global economy as a whole. The World Bank estimates that productivity will increase, with a positive impact on GDP, as a result of the fact that Russia will be able to attract new foreign investors and acquire high-quality technological products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union is Russia’s biggest economic partner, the volume of products exported to the European Union being in excess of EUR 138 billion, and the fact that Russia is anchored in the multilateral trade system and has therefore signed up to its rules represents a step towards the improvement of EU-Russia bilateral relations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in my turn, I welcome Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation after 18 years of negotiations. Romanian manufacturers, especially those of products of animal origin, are eager to enter a market with huge consumption potential where so far, unfortunately, they have come up against arbitrary and at times hostile measures. However, there are still problems, some of which have already been mentioned in this discussion. Russia must eliminate protectionist measures such as the ban on imports of pigs. Not least, it must stop invoking health grounds arbitrarily. I would like to remind you of Russia’s attitude in March, when it banned imports of live animals from the European Union during the Schmallenberg virus crisis, even though this ban was not in accordance with the standards of the World Organisation for Animal Health. The examples do not end there.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Not least, I would like to recall the position of this Parliament, which has clearly stated that our trading partners in the agricultural sector must pledge to abide by precisely the same quality and food security standards that we require of European farmers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, if I were to summarise this debate, I would say that it was quite clear that we all warmly welcome the accession of Russia to the WTO. We had – and we still have – positive expectations as to how this membership will be beneficial to our mutual relationship. But we also have to record a certain disappointment with the application of WTO rules in Russia. I also noted a very clear call from the honourable Members of this Parliament to the Commission to look for constructive solutions and to make sure that Russia respects WTO rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very important in the negotiations with our Russian partners to highlight the positive benefits that the WTO agreement brings to both sides. In my introductory remarks I referred to the expected EUR 2.5 billion in savings for European exporters to Russia thanks to the decrease of import duties. I can also say that EUR 3.9 billion of additional EU exports is expected per year. In terms of the benefits this will bring to the Russian side, I would claim that they will be of a similar order.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is clearly a win-win solution, and it could be a real success story for both Russia and the European Union if the rules are respected and correctly applied. This was mentioned by several speakers, including Mrs Koch-Mehrin, Mr Scholz and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.</p>
      <p sl="en">In reply to Mrs Andersdotter, I would like to underline the fact that Russia needs to apply the WTO rules regarding TRIPS - intellectual property rights - from the date of accession. The Commission is, of course, obliged to monitor how compliance with these rules is ensured by the Russian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a discussion, and several comments, concerning the new agreement. It is supposed to be a wide agreement covering all areas of the very far-ranging relationship between the European Union and Russia. I believe that if we succeed in negotiating and agreeing the new agreement, it will help us tackle the problems which were raised by Mrs Vaidere, especially veterinary restrictions, procurement and breach of intellectual property rights. So we think that it is very important to negotiate and to work on this new agreement. What would be the most useful in this respect would be to pursue our bilateral path.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that a positive outcome of the negotiations on the new agreement would be helpful – and indeed crucial – for Russia, because respect for WTO rules, a good agreement, and compliance with this agreement on both the Russian and European sides are key to the integration of Russia into the global rules-based system, which I believe would benefit both sides.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several questions were raised about what we would like to see in the new agreement. It is quite clear that we regard it as important, in addition to the usual traditional components of such an agreement, to have very clear and solid articles on trade, investment and energy provisions, because without those key components we would not be able to conclude the agreement. We want to have an all-encompassing document which will provide a real framework for our bilateral relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all the remarks, it was quite clear that honourable Members feel a certain disappointment about the way in which the WTO rules are respected by Russia. There have been clear calls for the Commission to act and look for ways to remedy the current problems and the current situation. I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: we will start by trying to find agreed solutions to this problem, but, failing that, we will not hesitate to enforce our rights under the WTO when they are violated. These are our rights. We have a system whereby the WTO sets the rules for all the Members and, if the rules are breached, the remedy should be sought and applied. It is quite clear that this is something that the European Union will have to do if these infringements of the rules persist.</p>
      <p sl="en">In reply to Mr Mirsky, who commented on the situation and the restrictions on border crossing, I would just like to assure him that the Commission is aware of the situation and that this problem will be raised in discussions with our Russian partners. Regarding the last comment, on the situation in Georgia, which was raised by Mr Lisek, I would just like to underline that Georgia is also a member of the WTO and can use the WTO system to raise this issue and to address the ban with the World Trade Organisation, but, as far as we know, so far it has chosen not to.</p>
      <p sl="en">To close, I would like to thank honourable Members for a very good debate. I appreciate the support for the overall thrust of the Commission’s policy towards Russia. Together with many honourable Members, I would like to express the hope that, through constructive dialogue with our Russian partners, we will be able to achieve greater compliance with WTO rules. This would clearly be to the benefit of trade and the overall relationship between the European Union and Russia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The World Trade Organisation is an organisation for big international business which groups many countries around a fundamental idea – the principle of free and unfettered trade in goods, services and intellectual property. The winner in this trade is not state protectionism, but competitiveness, as the motor for the global progress of civilisation. It does, however, throw up global challenges: delocalisation of capital, local structural unemployment, and even crises, like the one we are currently experiencing in Europe. Russia is a big economic player on a global scale, which, like China, may exert an influence on the European debt crisis, which is a consequence of free, but unbalanced, trade. This means there is an urgent need for global mechanisms to bring equilibrium to the trade balance. As a WTO member, Russia will become a more predictable partner for the EU, which will reduce the risk of trading with that country and enable the trade deficit of some EU countries to be limited. Russia is a large supplier of mineral raw materials, including gas and oil, and of natural raw materials – cereals and timber. At the same time it is a vast sales market for investment and consumer goods. The accession of Russia to the WTO will without doubt benefit both parties: the EU and Russia. As is usual in such instances, during the transition period this may be accompanied by phenomena such as a rise in unemployment in this country and migration flows, and even by dumping practices. We must also bear in mind that Russia also forms part of an independent customs union with three states that are not WTO members.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Union and the Russian Federation share the same geopolitical space. It would be a mistake to simplify the relationship between these two powers to an exchange ‘of energy for manufactured goods’. The EU and Russia have many other mutual interests rooted in their common history and cultures. After all, we share the same land and are neighbours. I would like to believe that Russia’s accession to WTO proved that Russia had abandoned the former ‘block thinking’ and is making significant steps towards being part of a multipolar modern world. How unfortunate that Russophobic sentiments mean that many Western countries are still stuck in the days of October 1962. The EU tends to lecture Russia on human rights, often linking the issues to the former Soviet communist era. One has to wonder with a smile why the still-communist-China is a much larger trading partner of the EU than Russia. Many economists, who have been so wrong so many times before, believe that the EU’s economic gains from Russia’s accession to the WTO will be modest. Perhaps, but we should let the future show. Meanwhile, let us, the European Union, welcome Russia into the WTO family and understand this step as Russia’s political demonstration of the will to be our partner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Two months after Russia’s accession to the WTO I share the concerns of my European colleagues regarding the unjustified temporary import bans, unilateral temporary tariff increases and protectionist measures in trade, introduced or extended by Russia. Today we note that in the run-up to the completion of its WTO accession Russia has not been fully living up to its future WTO obligations, and call on Russia to remove barriers to open and fair trade, which do damage to EU exporters. The opening of Russia’s economy to more international trade and investment should serve as an incentive for the Russian Government to pursue reforms fighting corruption, implementing the rule of law and enhancing the business climate. In this context, remembering that today is the ninth anniversary of the arrest of former head of Yukos Mikhail Hodorkovsky – a clear example of the business climate remaining unfavourable in Russia – I join my colleagues in demanding an independent and impartial investigation into the Yukos case.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Russian membership of the WTO is having a positive effect on the economy. Free trade is important within Europe; however, it is also important outside Europe. Russia should of course act as a full member by fulfilling all the obligations that membership entails. This also applies to France, which is selling Mistral vessels to them. In the Baltic Sea and SECA, strict UNCLOS and EL directives apply concerning the maximum permissible sulphur content of marine fuels. Taking Mistral vessels into the Baltic Sea will not have a positive effect on either its biological or its political environment. Ceterum censeo : I am certain that France will regret its decision to sell Mistral vessels to Russia.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Greece has in this recent period been making a great, monumental effort, alongside the economic effort, to combat illegal immigration, and this is certainly taking place against a background of racist and extremist voices. In spite of everything, we are already seeing palpable results with the efforts that are being made. The flow of illegal immigrants across the Evros has greatly decreased, and altogether the flow into our country has been reduced owing to better protection of the borders, and I would remind you that the country is also under great pressure at present because of events in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, it is an appropriate time – so I shall mention it here – for us to realise that Greece can no longer shoulder the costs of illegal immigration on its own. This is now the time to give greater prominence to the distribution clause which has already been included in our non-legislative documents. This idea may represent the best possible tool to enable Europe to work with true solidarity and equal distribution of the costs incurred.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, on 6 April 2009 the Abruzzo region of central Italy suffered a serious earthquake. There were many dozens of human victims, and schools, public buildings, nurseries, hospitals and other infrastructure were destroyed. The European Parliament bypassed bureaucratic procedures and, acting on a proposal by Italian MEPs, mobilised the European Solidarity Fund and approved EUR 500 million for the relief of residents in the earthquake-stricken areas and repair of the damage.</p>
      <p sl="el">Three years later – only last Monday, Madam President – an Italian court convicted a group of six seismologists because they had not foreseen the earthquake. This decision is absurd, unprecedented and, in my opinion, dangerous. This decision does not condemn seismologists, it does not condemn scientists, it condemns the science itself, and all the sciences. It is not my intention to ask the European Parliament to intervene in Italy’s independent judicial system, but allow me, Madam President, to say that the judges are judged.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to address the issue of the resignation of Mr Dalli and the Tobacco Products Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to Mr Dalli, I will not repeat what many of you have read in the European, national and international media, which merely highlights the fact that many questions remain unanswered. Whether Mr Dalli is guilty of misconduct or not is currently as clear as mud. The European Parliament and the European public deserve to be better informed on such matters, and I hope they will be in future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will now move on to what I consider a more serious concern – namely the status of the Tobacco Products Directive following the resignation of Mr Dalli. Tobacco kills over 600 000 EU citizens a year and is a public health scourge which demands stronger action. I remain unconvinced by statements from the Commission that the Tobacco Directive remains a priority. The Commission says that the directive will not be delayed, but that at the same time work will continue once the new Maltese Commissioner is in place, perhaps delaying it by months. DG SANCO has finished its work on the Tobacco Directive and I understand that inter-service consultation is complete or nearly completed. I fail to understand why it is necessary to wait for the new Commissioner to be in place in order to progress this directive. I would therefore ask the Commission to release the proposal swiftly, in the interests of the health of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to share with you a story about a user comment on YouTube that I found a few months ago. It says that the user is against pirated videos but really liked the song in question, and so offers ‘an apology for the copyright’. That perfectly encapsulates what is wrong with the copyright system – when users apologise for interacting with culture in a way that they find most natural to them.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, 10 new Member States joined the European Union in 2004. The accession process was preceded by negotiations where the priority accorded to general interests pushed a good number of issues to the back burner. One such issue was the legal implications of the discriminative Beneš decrees in Czechoslovakia. The decrees created after the war laid the foundations for applying the principle of collective guilt and the shameful practice of ethnic cleansing. We cannot definitively declare that the decrees have no legal impact today as the courts have had to interpret them on many occasions. I understand that back then the European Union, in good faith, did not want to erect any barriers to the accession of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, the EU had to assume that this outstanding issue infringing the rights of European Union citizens would have to be resolved at some time. The EU plays a leading role around the world in protecting human rights, and it should be no different at home.

      <p sl="mt">I wish to call attention to the political developments in Malta over the past few months. The Nationalist Party won the general elections in 2008 with a relative majority of 49.3%, which means a majority of one Member of Parliament. Over the past few months, this majority in Parliament has lost important votes, Members on the government side have abstained a number of times and also voted against government policy, and votes of no confidence have been tabled against government ministers. What is more, a member of the governing parliamentary group has resigned. This means that the governing party does not have a stable majority in Parliament but only a coalition agreement with this member.</p>
      <p sl="mt">In Malta, the Government is governing without the support of an absolute majority of the people and without a stable majority of members in Parliament. The Maltese Parliament has not functioned properly for some months now. State news broadcasts are manipulated by the governing party. This situation requires the Government to seek democratic backing from the electorate. That means the calling of elections. The Nationalist Government has not done so. If it is to face up to the economic crisis, Malta needs a government that is stable and capable of governing without uncertainty.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to condemn the fact that some governments of Member States are ordering police charges at demonstrations against the cuts that are being experienced, especially in southern Europe. Amnesty International has just published a report that condemns this disproportionate use of police force in three countries: Spain, Greece and Romania.</p>
      <p sl="es">Specifically in Spain we have a problem, as the state security forces, in particular the riot police, are acting without the legally required visible personal identification. As they are not identified, any disproportionate police charge and any abuse of any citizen goes unpunished, as the officer who acted improperly cannot be identified.</p>
      <p sl="es">The responsibility is political and does not lie with the police, but with those responsible for giving orders in these circumstances, and I therefore believe that consideration needs to be given to guaranteeing that no action by any member of the security forces goes unpunished.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the Basque Country has a model for development which, along with its individual cultural and social characteristics, forms a country brand: Euskadi-Basque Country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirty years ago we were an industrial ruin. Over three decades we have increased our gross domestic product tenfold and achieved an income level similar to that of the Netherlands. The work and commitment of Basque society and policies aimed at supporting the real economy, led by the Basque Nationalist Party, which won the elections on Sunday, have consolidated our identity, which will be seen to be complete without the terrorism of ETA and with peace and normalisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Currently we are suffering due to the crisis. We will tackle it by regaining budgetary balance and supporting industry, employment, innovation, competitiveness and internationalisation, not forgetting those who are suffering the most. There can be no economic development without human development, and we want to bring to Europe what might be useful from what we have learned and ask for recognition and protection for our institutions and aspirations for self-government.</p>
      <p sl="es">The men and women of the Basque Country said at the polls on Sunday that they want to preserve that identity and integrate it into Europe. Listen to the people and they will help to strengthen democracy in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the government in Greece, with its foreign allies – the European Union and the Troika – arrived at Memorandum 3 after a preposterous display of so-called disagreements. Wages and pensions slashed by up to 35 %, annihilation of every employment right, savage health, welfare and education cuts. One-and-a-half million workers found themselves out on the street without unemployment benefit, without any social security. The number of unemployed in the construction and shipbuilding industries runs into thousands. Workers in the Skaramangas shipyards are working only four days a month. Fiscal deficits are the pretext, although for 20 years now barbaric anti-labour measures to secure a cheap workforce have been the strategic aim of the monopolies, the European Union and the bourgeois governments. The recent report by the President of the European Council plainly admits it: memoranda on capitalist barbarity in every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="el">Enough! It is time for a popular uprising to put an end to capitalist barbarity, and for workers to build prosperity for the people, through their own popular power, upon the ruins of the power of the monopolies and the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members, and primarily the representatives of the Commission, to a very serious problem, which in recent months has made it impossible for many Romanian non-governmental organisations and foundations to operate. This concerns the operational irregularities in Romania of the Operational Programme ‘Human Resource Development’, owing to which the Commission has frozen the financing of winning projects for the period of the investigation. Obviously I am not disputing the legitimacy of the investigation and the need to explore the abuse; I would just like to highlight the unfair situation that has emerged, where the operations of several thousand NGOs are under threat because the Romanian authorities have delayed the disbursement of awarded funds for months.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Some organisations are attempting to bridge this uncertain period with bank loans, but there are now doubts hanging over the implementation of many projects that are extremely useful to society. We cannot allow the actions of a few malevolent beneficiaries or the lack of competence in some national authorities to bring the implementation of the entire Human Resource Development programme in Romania to its knees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to welcome the fact that the European Council meeting of 18 and 19 October clearly declared that boosting employment and social inclusion remains a priority of the utmost importance and called on all the Member States to step up their efforts to tackle the social consequences of the crisis and to fight poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The stumbling world economy and the debt crisis is tragic for our Union and has accelerated the harmful trends which mean that fewer and fewer people are able to maintain a proper standard of living. For more and more European citizens, everyday subsistence represents an insoluble challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council will devote a special meeting in November to reaching agreement on the next multiannual financial framework, which will be a crucial factor in improving the hopeless situation in the poorest European countries and for the marginalised millions of our Union. The Commission and Parliament have introduced proposals to give priority to the integration of the most disadvantaged communities, and I truly hope that the 14 governments corresponding to our political group will promote those amendments unanimously in the Council and facilitate a regional policy that helps the most deprived and marginalised 30 million Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we are all aware of the financial and other difficulties faced by European farmers because of the unfavourable weather conditions and the extreme drought in certain regions across the Union. For instance, in Romania, drought destroyed almost half of cereal crops and industrial crops this year, and this situation is causing serious losses to the agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To help mitigate these difficulties, I believe that a number of measures need to be adopted urgently at EU level. The European Union must show solidarity with farmers who have seen their work go to waste because of this year’s drought. The national and local authorities have done everything they can in this situation, but EU support is essential. The European Union has created the EU Solidarity Fund to help people in regions affected by natural disasters such as flooding. Solutions also need to be found in the event of drought, as this phenomenon has major implications for both farmers and food security.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the disastrous floods that have occurred recently in my region of Aragon, in the areas of Jacetania as well as in Alto Gállego, las Cinco Villas, la Hoya de Huesca, Los Monegros and even in the capital, Zaragoza, causing substantial damage in up to 105 towns and seriously affecting roads, homes, crops, railways, paths, schools and other public establishments, with a cost that is currently estimated at more than EUR 24 million.</p>
      <p sl="es">At a time when the economic crisis and drought are seriously affecting my region of Aragon, this fresh disaster is adding to the desolation and desperation. This is why we do not believe that the regional People’s Party Government has acted coherently, being unaware of the action taken by the mayors, when it should have urgently and immediately applied for European aid from the European Union Solidarity Fund. It is very important that the people of Aragon should be able to receive European support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today I had the honour of witnessing the signature of my report by the President of Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council, when they formally entered into EU legislation the Regulation on certain measures in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">This regulation now gives Commissioner Damanaki the necessary tools to introduce hard-hitting sanctions against countries engaged in unsustainable fishing practices – countries such as Iceland and the Faroe Islands in the case of mackerel, a straddling stock in the North East Atlantic. This fishery was expected to be worth in excess of EUR 1 billion in 2010, before the onset of overfishing by these islands. In 2008, both islands were fishing very modest amounts of mackerel. This, of course, is in sharp contrast to the landings in 2011, which reached up to 150 000 tonnes in both cases – a totally unsustainable figure. This unsustainable increase in landings was at first hidden to a degree, and the price did not drop significantly because of the unfortunate situation in Japan.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, let me say that the Commissioner, now that she has the tools, must take urgent action and implement the relevant provision contained in the Regulation, which had almost unanimous support in this House, bearing in mind that talks to resolve the dispute once again broke down without agreement in London this week.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, last week, during a visit from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Bucharest hosted a debate organised by the ALDE Group on the subject of SME financing which, in addition to MEPs, was attended by more than 100 representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises and the banking sector, along with representatives of the European institutions, including Commissioner Tajani, and of the Romanian Government. This was an extremely important opportunity for us to find out the real concerns of SMEs, which is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I have often heard it said that Parliament and the European institutions in general are very much out of touch with the real concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe it is necessary for both us as MEPs and the Commission to engage in intensive dialogue with SMEs so that, at European level, we can develop policies that take their needs into account as much as possible. Many SMEs are complaining that the terms of participation in European programmes are completely unfavourable. For that reason, especially since a large number of multiannual programmes and, in particular, the multiannual financial framework are under discussion at the moment, we must take these realities into account and adapt the rules to make them more attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, MEPs have immunity intended to protect the freedom of expression. However, most of us in this Chamber would agree that it should never cover immunity on grounds of hate speech. As a representative from the North of Ireland, an area emerging from conflict, I can state that we are working very hard towards conflict resolution and reconciliation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that conflict can only be resolved by engaging with your enemy, negotiating a settlement, talking and making space for the other, moving away from the intransigence of: ‘I am right and my enemy, my opponent, must accept my righteousness’. Given that this Parliament emerged from a war, from a conflict, and aims to build prosperity and solidarity, it should without hesitation disassociate itself from any MEP whose comments incite hatred.</p>
      <p sl="en">MEP Nick Griffin’s inflammatory comments while in Belfast, which have resulted in the police service preparing a file for the public prosecution service, and his outrageous Twitter postings last week, putting the lives of two gay men at risk, should not be covered by MEP immunity and privileges.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would ask the European Commission to urgently propose a strategy to combat the disastrous effects of the rise in the price of cereals on the European market. The inadequate harvest caused by the drought has led to an alarming shortage of wheat and maize, which has been reflected in the abrupt increase in food prices. This situation is hitting consumers hard. In addition, across the whole of the European Union, livestock breeders are worried that they will have nothing to feed their animals, and this will be reflected in further price rises.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Recently Ukraine expressed its intention to suspend its exports of wheat with effect from 15 November, which caused an immediate rise in the price of wheat on the Chicago Stock Exchange. The European Commission is now speaking of unnecessary tensions on the international agricultural markets. These tensions are not unnecessary; they reflect a real situation, a bad harvest, coupled with a rise in the price of oil.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Let us not forget that prices will remain high. In the first quarter of next year, food prices will reach record highs and will continue to rise, stoking inflation in the agri-food sector. The European Union needs a rapid strategy to overcome this situation. Whenever it is asked about such a strategy, the Commission replies that we need structural measures. Of course we do, but we also need specific solutions for crisis situations like the current one.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would principally like to address the European Commission, which is why I am extremely delighted that the Commissioner is here today. The Kyoto Protocol established in 1997 as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change expires in 2012, and therefore Member States will again make an attempt in Doha to extend the commitments by eight years to 2020. Although certain Member States, including Hungary, made individual commitments too, based on the ‘bubble concept’ the European Union is considered to be a single state. This explains why Central and Eastern European countries, including Hungary, also adhere to the majority of the emission reduction obligations undertaken by the EU for 2012, and accept the resultant burdens.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Specifically, Hungary agreed to a 6 % reduction based on the Kyoto Protocol, in contrast to which a saving of 25 % was actually made. This is why we find the opinion of the Commission unacceptable that it will not allow us to carry such reserves forward to the following period and perhaps sell them. This is at a time when countries in Central and Eastern Europe could find such resources vital and use them for new environmental protection and emission-reduction investments. The Hungarian Government has made a specific proposal in this respect and I would like the Commission to discuss it and enforce it during subsequent negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the incompetence of Romania’s right-wing governments over the past two years has led to financial corrections and the recent pre-suspension of the best part of three programmes co-financed from EU Structural Funds. For the 2010-2011 period, the Commission has identified serious failings in the management and control system for the ‘Transport’, ‘Regional’ and ‘Increase of Economic Competitiveness’ Operational Programmes. So that this pre-suspension will not lead to a reduction in the amounts which Romania can absorb during this financial period, the Romanian Government has two months in which to rectify the failings reported.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would ask the European Commission for its full availability and cooperation with the Romanian Government to rectify the failings and make it possible to resume the cofinancing from European funds of projects which can contribute to Romania’s economic and social development and are so badly needed by Romanians.</p>

      <p sl="et">Madam President, soon, the European Parliament will consider a draft directive on greenhouse gases emitted from motor fuels and the methods for calculating emissions. Adopting that draft would establish a legislative framework which would complicate the marketing of motor fuels based on oil shale in the EU Member States. For Estonia the possibility of continuing the production of fuels from oil shale is of strategic importance for reducing dependence on imported fuels and diversifying the fuel market, but the said draft creates a less favourable market situation for distributors of unconventional motor fuels and the principles set out therein impede rather than favour the sale of fuels based on oil shale on the Estonian market.</p>
      <p sl="et">This way CO2 emissions will increase rather than decrease because of the creation of an artificial need to import all of the diesel fuel required in Estonia whereas at the same time an equivalent amount of diesel fuel is exported from Estonia. I believe that the unnecessary transportation of fuel back and forth should rather be avoided. Furthermore, it is not reasonable to pay the so-called CO2 premiums to mediation companies and deliver diesel fuel produced in Estonia outside the EU since this fuel will return to our markets mixed with other fuels imported into Estonia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Nobel Peace Prize committee clearly either has a devious sense of humour or a fundamental misunderstanding of the word ‘peace’, because three years ago they gave it to the drone warrior Obama. Three years later they want to give it to the EU, which is an institution or group of institutions, together with right-wing governments across Europe, waging what can only be described as class war on working people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Austerity is their weapon of choice in that war, and that weapon is being wielded absolutely viciously on behalf of the bankers, bondholders, big business and the rich against workers across Europe, for us to pay for their crisis. But now they are facing a simultaneous and massive fightback. Greek workers have been joined on the front line by workers from Spain and Portugal, with millions protesting across Europe in the past weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Very significantly, united, general strike action will take place in Greece, Spain, Portugal, Malta and Cyprus on 14 November. This must be added to by mass protests in other countries across Europe. That date, 14 November, can go down in history as the day that workers across Europe stood up and said ‘no’ to austerity. It must leave the Troika in no doubt about the determination of workers to resist, and their power to do so, and it can be the vital next step in building Europe-wide general strike action to stop their austerity agenda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Two years ago, Nigel Farage pledged complete transparency for the expenses of his MEPs, with statements published and updated quarterly. But, as so often, UKIP was lying. Looking at his own website, Mr Farage’s expenditure accounts are a complete fabrication. They are missing most details and are entirely unaudited; they are simply make-believe. He even claims he has lost his receipts. He criticises the European Union’s management of its finances, but he cannot even keep his own receipts.</p>
      <p sl="en">His Deputy, Paul Nuttall, has not updated his accounts for two years. His website details show general expenditure that only accounts for a fraction of what we know that MEPs actually get paid. So where has the rest gone? It goes, as we all know, into the personal bank accounts of MEPs, so maybe we can assume that it has gone into his back pocket – unless he can explain otherwise.</p>
      <p sl="en">UKIP has broken its promise. Far from being transparent, it is opaque and dirty. It pretends to be honest, but in reality it is practising a great game of deceit.
