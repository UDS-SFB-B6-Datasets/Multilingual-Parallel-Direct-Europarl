      <p sl="unknown">I would like to pass on five pieces of news by way of preliminary remarks.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would firstly like to touch on the situation in the Mediterranean, which, as we all know, is changing very rapidly. The European Parliament was and is ready to lend its support to democratic changes initiated by the citizens themselves, who are our European neighbours. When we hold our debate today on Tunisia, we will be discussing a partner country which has already taken the first steps on the path towards true democracy. Just a short while ago, I met the Tunisian Foreign Affairs Minister, and I was accompanied by five other Members of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The situation in Egypt is different, and it is less certain which direction is being taken by the changes, which are already irreversible. These changes must not lose their momentum, however. Both countries have one thing in common: all the democratic forces urgently need to make every effort to undertake political reforms, and subsequently economic and social reforms. They also need to lay the groundwork for free and democratic elections, so that the people’s demands for democracy do not go unanswered. We must also make it known – and we will do this during this part-session, both today and tomorrow during voting time – that democracy in neighbouring countries is just as important to the European Union as their stability. There is no choice between democracy and stability; both are imperative.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The second matter is that 20 January 2011 was the 20th anniversary of the Latvian ‘Bloody Sunday’, as the day is historically known. On this day, the pro-Soviet OMON units attacked strategic buildings in the capital of the newly-reborn state. Seven people lost their lives on the barricades defending Latvian independence, and many were injured.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 29 January 2011, after a trial which was an affront to international standards, the Dutch and therefore EU citizen Zahra Bahrami was hanged in Iran. I would call on the Iranian authorities to clarify the charges made against Mrs Bahrami, and the opaque judicial procedure. The European Union holds the position that the death penalty can never be regarded as an act of justice.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 26 January 2011, David Kato, a defender of human rights and civil rights activist, was murdered in Uganda. I would call on the Ugandan authorities to apprehend the perpetrators of this crime. We all deplore the fact that homosexuality continues to be regarded as a crime in this country.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Finally, my last piece of news: in connection with today’s debate on preparation for the European Council on 4 February, I would like to inform you that on 8 February, or in other words next week, a meeting of the Conference of Presidents will take place that is open to all Members of Parliament. Mr Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, will be a guest at this special meeting, when he will present the conclusions of Friday’s summit in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, which states that the President shall report on such matters to us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I hope that the House and you will allow me this short indulgence to congratulate you on the statement you have made on behalf of David Kato who was murdered in Uganda. He was, as you said, a human rights defender and he defended the rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just wanted to say that here in this House we have passed a motion on what is happening in Uganda. It is vital that we support Ugandan civil society and remember that David was a giant who stood above those who preached hatred and discrimination, and we should remember his family at this sad time.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like you to consider with the Conference of Presidents timetabling the one-minute speeches earlier, because in the last part-sessions this was pushed back to the last hour of our discussions.

    <intervention id="3-023-000" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statement by the President concerning the EU’s recognition of the Roma genocide during World War II (2010/3020(RSP)).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Today the Roma are the largest ethnic minority in the European Union. They are also the most oppressed community in Europe at present. During World War II they were persecuted on grounds of race by the Nazis, in the same way as Jews. Hundreds of thousands of Roma, whose ancestors had been European citizens for generations, were slaughtered. The 66th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, which we commemorated on 27 January this year, serves as a reminder to us that the Roma were the third largest group among the victims of this camp. Unfortunately, not all Europeans are aware of this fact. Only a few EU Member States have officially recognised the Roma genocide. It is time to make European citizens aware of the fact that the Roma living among us experienced the trauma of genocide as a community. Education is the best way to fight discrimination. The European Parliament acts as the EU’s voice in the fight for human rights. Today we are speaking up for our Roma brothers and sisters. We would like their suffering to be remembered and their situation to be better understood.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Colleagues, there will now be a very short discussion on this topic so please do not leave the Chamber. First we will have a statement from the Council and, as you know, Roma integration is one of the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. This will be followed by a statement from the Vice-President of the Commission and then short statements on behalf of the political groups.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-025-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Enikő Győri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to begin by quoting the words of Porajmos survivor Friderika Kolompár: ‘We found my father when we went to Auschwitz on 2 August of ‘94 or ‘95. Their names were arrayed on a large plaque. We knew that they had been taken to Germany, but not the exact location. If a Gipsy man from Fehérvár had not stopped me, I would have reached into the oven and taken out a piece. I thought I would take it out and take it home as a relic. At that point my son, Józsi, said:</p>
      <p sl="hu">“Don’t reach in there, Mother, you might get an infection.”</p>
      <p sl="hu">“I don’t care, my son,” said I.</p>
      <p sl="hu">“How do you know that it belonged to your brother or your father?” he asked in reply. I fainted and was taken out of the crematorium.’</p>
      <p sl="hu">On behalf of the Hungarian Presidency I would like to join the noble initiative through which the European Parliament, and President Buzek personally, wished to commemorate the victims of the Porajmos, the Roma Holocaust, in this sitting. Why is it important to remember? Should we not concern ourselves with the future instead? American historian George Santayana wrote in 1905: ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.’</p>
      <p sl="hu">Even the most modest estimates put the number of Roma and Sinti killed during and in the shadow of World War II at 220 000. They were killed for the sole reason of belonging to these two ethnic groups or, in the terms of their persecutors, ‘race.’ They were of Hungarian, Czech, Romanian, French, German, Polish, Serb and who knows what other nationalities. Men and women, elderly people and children. Many, many children. If they were alive, many of them would be EU citizens today. Commemorations consistently recall that, unlike Jewish captives, families in the Auschwitz-Birkenau Gipsy camp could stay together. As a Hungarian Holocaust survivor recalled: ‘even the SS knew that Gipsy families could not be separated. They were allowed to stay together until the night of 2–3 August 1944, when the surviving captives of the 30 000 inhabitants of their camp were murdered as their barracks were burned.’</p>
      <p sl="hu">The EU was reborn after World War II from this low; the hell of the Shoah and the Porajmos. The dream of the founding fathers was that the peoples of Europe would, all together, reject all that had led to such extreme disregard for human life, to Auschwitz and Birkenau. The peoples of Europe jointly, including the European Roma population of currently 10 to 12 million. ‘But this is still the past,’ one could say. ‘Where is the future in this?’ The Hungarian Presidency believes that we must indeed talk about the past and the future simultaneously. When Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán presented the programme of the Hungarian EU presidency to the European Parliament on 19 January, he said: ‘The Roma strategy is a priority aspect of the Hungarian Presidency, because there is no point in a smart Europe if it has no heart. Europe, however, will only have a heart if it creates opportunities for social inclusion for the most disadvantaged social groups.’</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would personally be very proud if we could all jointly adopt a common European framework strategy for the Roma by the end of this presidency. Work is in progress, thanks to the commitment of the European Parliament and the European Commission. The Council and its Hungarian Presidency would like to contribute to this. We would like to contribute to the strengthening of the realisation that the Roma, like all peoples and ethnic groups of Europe and the entire world, are not a problem, but an economic, cultural and human resource.</p>

    <intervention id="3-026-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, a few days ago we commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day in the European Parliament together with Holocaust survivors. On behalf of the Commission, I highly appreciate the fact that today we are commemorating the Roma genocide victims as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">After visits to Oswiecim, Yad Vashem or the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC, you are always shocked by the inhumanity of the Holocaust perpetrators. Those of you who visited the Children’s Pavilion in Jerusalem would agree with me that you leave the pavilion shaken and you cannot believe that such events were possible in Europe and only 60 or 70 years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore we have to speak about this. We have to teach our children about this sad story because, as we know, history has a tendency to repeat itself. So we must make absolutely sure that this horror will be remembered and never repeated. Let us all fight together the ghosts of the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">History has taught us a bitter lesson in what racial hatred and intolerance can do. The European Union is therefore built on fundamental rights and values, which include the protection of minorities, the principle of free movement and the prohibition of discrimination, and all these apply in full to Roma.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, Roma people still have to face discrimination on the basis of their ethnic origin. Too many Roma are still victims of racism, discrimination and social exclusion. Too many Roma children are still on the streets instead of going to school. Too many Roma are still denied fair chances in the labour market and too many Roma women are still victims of violence and exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inclusion of Roma is a priority for the EU and it requires the commitment and joint efforts of national and local authorities, civil society and EU institutions. For its part, the Commission is deeply committed to improving the situation of Roma people and, in particular, their social and economic integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have been working continually to these ends: this is a longstanding and long-term commitment for us. However, we have to acknowledge that responsibility for Roma integration lies primarily with the Member States and that is why, in the communication we adopted last year, we provided them with a concrete list of actions for making their Roma integration policies more effective. This was the first-ever policy document dedicated specifically to Roma.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, our assessment shows that further serious work needs to be done in the Member States to improve the effectiveness of their policies for Roma integration. That is why, in April, in close cooperation with the Hungarian Presidency, the Commission will adopt a European framework for national Roma integration strategies, which will make proposals for tackling Roma exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, at this solemn moment let me emphasise again, on behalf of the Commission, the importance of protecting fundamental rights in Europe and ensuring the harmonious integration of all into society. It is very important to make sure that history definitely never will repeat itself.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Minister of State, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to express my satisfaction and gratitude that, for the first time, the European Parliament is commemorating the Roma victims of the Holocaust. This is exactly what we, their descendants, have to do: remember and learn. We must show respect for the suffering of the victims, and integrate these painful lessons, in unity and mutual tolerance, into our common history and common memory. This is why it is important for us to support universities, scientific societies and research institutes that help reveal and present the hardships faced and endured by the Roma during our long history. I propose that national curricula in all European countries should present the centuries-long common history shared by majority societies and the Roma.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This day, too, provides an occasion to reinforce this unity and to reassert that we, the Roma, are citizens of our countries and a state-creating factor; free and equal European citizens. We should be content with nothing less.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Seven hundred years of common history lie behind us; seven centuries filled with struggle, during which we demonstrated our loyalty to our home countries and Europe on countless occasions. While remembering the dark times of segregation and persecution, we must draw strength from these uplifting moments of our shared history, and find hope that, by uniting, we may become a dignified, harmonious community. Just as we share a common history, so will we share a common future, as we all know; and I should like to hope that together we can achieve everything, as I am also certain that we can only achieve everything together.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The committed efforts of successive generations will be needed for everyone to endeavour to build a more acceptable and more perfect world in their own lives and their own surroundings. Our ancestors have demonstrated innumerable times that our nations are able to unite if our destiny is at stake. And for us, the situation of the Roma of Europe is a question of destiny. It is our turn now, and the first step must be taken today.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If you allow me to add one more thought, the second step will need to be taken two weeks from now at the plenary sitting, when the European Roma strategy can finally be launched according to the expectations of all of us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you for your statement, and I would also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission. I would like to thank all those who suggested we have this debate – from my group, Mrs Göncz in particular. As you said today, Mr President, the extermination of the Roma has often been pushed into the background when talking about the extermination of the Jews. However, there were also other victims of the National Socialist atrocities. In this context, I would also like to mention the homosexuals, as you have also done today in a different context, Mr President.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and also with the previous speaker that the best form of commemoration is when we also think about the future. We cannot be satisfied with the situation of the Roma on our continent today. They are still discriminated against and prejudices still exist. When a country is now considering reverting back to the name ‘gypsies’ instead of using the name ‘Roma’ in order to avoid any confusion, then I will certainly not criticise that, only to say that the fight against the prejudices and the fight against discrimination is what is important and not bowing to the discrimination by changing a name.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have been debating the issue of the Roma in this Parliament for years, and we have to admit – even on our visits to the various countries – that there are still very major problems, that the cycle of discrimination and disadvantage has still not been broken and that many children are today still being taught in separate schools. I am therefore also very grateful to the Hungarian Presidency for taking up this subject. Despite all the differences of opinion that we have, Mrs Győri, on this matter we will hopefully achieve a major success together.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our group has for some time been in contact, through Mr Schulz, with Günter Grass, the German writer, who has also set up a Roma foundation. Günter Grass once said: ‘You, the Romani, in your permanent state of dispersal are – strictly speaking – Europeans in a sense that we, imprisoned in the confinement of our nationalities, ought to bear in mind if the united Europe is not to develop into a bureaucratic administrative and all-powerful economic colossus. At least in this one respect, with their cross-border mobility, the people we call gypsies are ahead of us. They should, first of all, be allowed to prove their identity with a European passport that guarantees them the right to stay anywhere from Romania to Portugal.’ (end of quote)</p>
      <p sl="de">We ought to create the conditions that make all Roma feel at home where they live. We ought also to create the conditions that allow them to travel freely throughout Europe without being deported again. When we finally see this happen then we really will have done a great deal for the Roma, and then we will have made the terrible things that the Nazis did to the Roma through the Holocaust during the Second World War a thing of the past.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, ‘Samudaripen’ is the word which means ‘hell on earth’ in the Romani language, in other words, genocide or holocaust. Hell on earth is the description of how Europe’s Roma lived during the Second World War when hundreds of thousands of them were murdered for the sole reason that they were Roma. We actually do not know the exact figure. The Holocaust Museum in Washington DC reckons that it is approximately a quarter of a million. Other studies mention more than a million Roma murdered during those years. This lack of certainty is due to the low profile of those Roma who were victims of the Holocaust. It is further proof that this people has been systematically discriminated against or ignored for centuries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why the declaration made today by the European Parliament, through its President, marks an historic moment. However, we cannot just stop at this. This occasion must be followed by specific measures at both EU and Member State level. Such acts of recognition of the Roma genocide must be made by every Member State and, furthermore, knowledge about this chapter in our history must be publicised among Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Until European children learn at school about this holocaust and the centuries for which the Roma have been slaves in many countries that are now EU Member States and until European society realises that we have a historical duty to this population, we will fail to conduct our anti-racism campaigns properly and we will not have too much success either with our national or European Roma inclusion strategies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I speak here this afternoon with deep feeling. Above all, Mr President, I would like to thank you personally for your commitment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The recognition of the Roma genocide is a historic moment for those millions of Europeans who belong to the Yenish, Sinti, Roma, Manouche and traveller peoples. Hundreds of thousands of their relatives were murdered during those dark years, often having been disgracefully branded as social outcasts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, it is also an historic moment for all of us, citizens of the European Union. Let us not forget, the Roma were the first to move between different countries of Europe, well before we had set up our common area. Today, with a population of 10 million, they are our largest minority. Their history is our history, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was high time, ladies and gentlemen, to restore the confidence of these European citizens in their European institutions. They have been shunned by our societies, and they still suffer from a double punishment. To the horrors of war have been added neglect, indifference and silence. The recognition of the Roma genocide is therefore a genuine act of remembrance. Clearly, it provides an opportunity to remember, but it should above all be a guarantee of a different future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last week at the Bundestag, Members of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments, from the East and West alike, shouldered their responsibility to history by encouraging recognition of this genocide. This is the first step towards changing the way in which our fellow citizens view these Europeans. There is still a long way to go. Let us make the Roma people European citizens in their own right.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the fact that the Roma were the victims of genocide during World War II is as self-evident as the fact that Jews were victims of the same process. Anyone who denies this fact should be treated as unforgivingly as those who deny the Holocaust of Jews. You are right to say that the Roma represented the third largest ethnic group among those massacred in Auschwitz. The second largest group were Poles. All the nations that were victims of the Holocaust during World War II should be remembered. We should remember everything that happened in Auschwitz and the other concentration camps, as well as the murders committed in Katyń and other places during those terrible five or six years, so that such events are never repeated. The European Parliament has a moral and political duty to ensure that this memory is kept alive, and our debate today is one way of doing so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important moment, because today, for the first time in the European Parliament, we are commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me start by with a farewell letter written by a 14-year-old boy, Robert Reinhard, in 1943 before his deportation to Auschwitz from a German children’s home. He wrote: ‘I have found my parents again. We are being transported to the concentration camp. After much soul-searching I have reached the point where I can face death. Thank you once again for everything that you have done for me. Greetings to you all. See you in heaven. Robert.’</p>
      <p sl="de">Like 500 000 other Roma and Sinti, this young boy never came back, and although the Roma and Sinti, together with the Jews, were the first victims of production line killing, today – 66 years on – the full truth of what happened remains untold. The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over. We need the whole truth about this chapter of history.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Roma and Sinti must be avenged and the Holocaust recognised as a crime against humanity, to ensure that it can never happen again. We must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people. We must put an end to racial hatred as well as violence, as seen the year before last in Hungary for example, and we should do this with the courage of our convictions. Freedom, equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few, but a right for all, because human rights and civil rights are indivisible.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to endorse what has been said so far. The Roma have made a decisive contribution to the development of Europe, especially to its culture. The comment I would like to make, and it is a rational comment, is that any programmes concerning the Roma in the European Union which come from the Commission are fragmented and are often included within the framework of social exclusion. I would propose a more rational approach. In other words, that the Commission adopt an initiative just for the Roma outside the framework of social exclusion, so that there is a programme which only concerns the Roma. This would enable us to work more effectively for the Roma at national level.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I very warmly welcome the call for the European Union to recognise the Roma genocide during the Second World War. Some Member States have already taken this step, and I hope that they will be followed by as many of the other Member States, and also by the European Union as an institution. Unfortunately, the large majority of European citizens are unaware of the Roma genocide. This is why, as was also emphasised by the Romanian president in his speech recognising the Roma genocide, made in October 2007, we must not stop at a symbolic gesture. We need to encourage the inclusion of information about the Roma holocaust in the school curriculum for European pupils. On the other hand, it is unacceptable that 66 years after the prisoners were liberated from the Auschwitz concentration camp an ethnic minority is subjected to such large-scale discrimination across the European Union. This is why I think that Roma social inclusion, one of the Hungarian Presidency’s priorities, must become the focus of a European policy based on specific, effective and measurable actions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Matters concerning the victims of the Third Reich’s tyranny during World War II are still an extremely delicate subject, but one which is worth looking at in detail. Today we want to broaden the context within which the term Holocaust is viewed, since the general public understands it to mean the mass extermination of Jews. The ‘cleansing’ of other ethnic, national and social groups during World War II should also be remembered and commemorated. Too few people are aware of what happened, in particular Europe’s young people. It is for this very reason that we are trying to raise the painful and somewhat neglected issue of the extermination of the Roma during today’s debate. Porajmos, which is the Roma term for this extermination, claimed between 500 000 and 2 million Roma throughout Europe. They were the third largest group in terms of nationality to be murdered in Auschwitz, after Jews and Poles. These facts leave no doubt as to the enormity of the losses suffered by the Roma, which places us, as Europeans, under an obligation to commemorate those who suffered the injustice of falling victim to genocide, and spread awareness of their fate. Raising awareness of these events is a priority for current and future generations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Roma are the largest ethnic minority in the EU at the moment, but they have also been the most oppressed down the ages. Hundreds of thousands of Roma were killed and persecuted during the Second World War. Unfortunately, only some Member States have recognised that the extermination of the Roma was actually an act of genocide. In honour of the victims’ memory and as a sign of deep respect for the Roma survivors of the Holocaust, in 2007 the Romanian President recognised the atrocities suffered by the Roma and awarded the National Cross for ‘Faithful Service’ 3rd class to three Roma who survived the genocide. The Roma are part of the future of Romania, a European Romania. The tragedy of the Holocaust is now part of our collective memory. I take this opportunity to welcome one of the Hungarian Presidency’s priorities, namely, the Roma integration strategy. The best form of commemoration is to look to the future. In every Member State we must examine the centuries of history which the Roma have been part of and strengthen this Roma initiative now. They are free, equal European citizens. We should also create the prerequisites for the free movement of Roma, without them being expelled again. We need a community which will be fully integrated into modern society.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the initiative from the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, requesting the European Union for official recognition of the genocide committed by the Nazis and their allies against the Roma population during the Second World War because it marks a step forward in the battle to defend the rights of the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Tens of thousands of members of the Roma population were subjected to torture or murdered in the Occupied Eastern Territories and thousands more died in the Nazi regime’s concentration camps. The historian Michael Billig summarises the principle of the racial superiority doctrine in the following statement: ‘A man is not killed for what he does, but for what he is’. This phrase can be used to sum up the sad reality of a time when more than a million Roma were oppressed and deprived of any freedoms, including freedom to procreate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that we need specific EU-level measures to combat racism and fight against social exclusion. I advocate that we need better cooperation and an exchange of good practices at EU level between national and European Roma inclusion strategies.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation for the European Council meeting of 4 February 2011. The first to speak will be Mrs Győri, President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Council. Please take the floor.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-041-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Enikő Győri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am very happy to be able to speak to you before the next meeting of the European Council, even though the role of the presidency-in-office is defined by the Treaty of Lisbon in such a way that the preparation of meetings of the European Council is primarily the responsibility of the permanent President. However, the presidency-in-office has cooperated very closely with the permanent President in preparing the meeting of the European Commission, for example in the case of the General Affairs Council held on Monday during the Hungarian Presidency. Furthermore, we are naturally monitoring the implementation of the European Council’s conclusions, both in the General Affairs Council and in other Council configurations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me to first give an outline of the major issues on the agenda of the February meeting, which primarily focus on energy and innovation. While determining the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Council decided in March 2010 to hold a thematic debate on the issue of energy and innovation. I believe I do not need to point out how extremely important these two sectors are for European economic growth and employment. That is because the task of the European Council is not only to respond to direct crisis situations, but also to formulate strategic guidelines for the future.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let us begin with the matter of energy. Energy security is a priority for all of us. This requires a greater degree of integration and interconnection of the energy market. We must increase research and development expenditure, make the economy more competitive and sustainable, and tighten cooperation between major transit, energy producer and energy consumer countries. The first element is therefore an integrated and interconnected energy market. The establishment of a complete internal energy market is a necessity. To this end, the European Council must decide on several important steps.</p>
      <p sl="hu">First of all, it must implement legislation on the internal energy market. We also still have regulatory tasks ahead of us. We must, for example, simplify authorisation procedures for building new infrastructure. Additionally, we must make serious efforts in order to modernise and expand European energy infrastructure, and also to connect the markets through cross-border cooperation. We must not allow any country or region of the EU to remain isolated. All this must be funded primarily by the private sector. Furthermore, appropriate cost sharing principles must be laid down for cross-border investments. Thirdly, there will be projects which, despite being of exceptional importance to energy security, will still not be attractive enough to private capital for it to finance them fully. In such cases it could be justified to provide limited public financing for the projects from Member State or EU resources. The aim of the current discussions, however, is not to prejudge the debate to be launched at the end of June on the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The second major topic in the field of energy is energy efficiency and renewable energy. Needless to say, these increase competitiveness and promote the security of energy supply, and also serve sustainability at lower costs. In 2011 the Council will examine the proposal that will be submitted by the Commission concerning the new energy efficiency plan. The proposal will take account of what has been achieved so far regarding the EU energy efficiency targets set until 2013, and will also envision additional measures. Foreign relations are also of exceptional importance in energy policy. EU and Member State activities related to key producer, transit and consumer countries must be coordinated more systematically. It would, for example, be expedient if Member States would not only share information with each other about treaties concluded with regard to natural gas, as they do today, but also those concerning other types of energy. Concrete work must begin in order to establish partnerships with key actors with regard to regulatory approaches in all matters of common interest. This of course applies to Russia, but also to all partners and neighbours of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let us move on to the topic of innovation. Innovation is what might help solve the most critical social challenges of our age, such as the challenges of health, food security, energy security, sustainable development, climate change and an aging population, while also providing opportunities for new markets. Innovation could also help resolve the dilemma between budgetary rigour and pro-growth policy. From where can we obtain funding for growth before it becomes self-sustaining? Not from credit, since that is not something we want. We want to stop debt, after all. It is therefore innovation through which reserves of creativity can be uncovered, which can help us give the appropriate answers. Within the topic of innovation we must therefore focus on responding to significant social challenges, and make progress towards a European Research Area. We must ensure the free mobility of researchers, improve framework conditions applicable to innovative enterprises, and the European Council must also address the matter of ranking state aid.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Energy and innovation: investments pointing towards the future. The European Council, however, must also deal with current economic and financial issues, as we all know that the crisis is not completely behind us yet. We are in a delicate situation. We must do everything in our power to protect the common currency, the euro, and calm the markets. The European Financial Stability Facility must therefore be strengthened, and bank stress tests must also be discussed. The Hungarian Presidency is particularly committed to the package of six economic governance laws. We wish to report on this, about how the consultations are coming along both in the Council and in Parliament, to the heads of state and government. And finally, we must address what further common measures are needed to ensure competitiveness, and, of course, in the current, acute situation, the heads of state and government will also speak about Tunisia and Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I trust that we will have a European Council dealing with very difficult issues, where specific questions can be formulated, which will also determine the work of the Council for the coming months, and President Herman Van Rompuy will report to you about this after the meeting.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-042-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this European Council takes place at a very important moment for our neighbourhood, namely Egypt, Tunisia and Belarus. While respecting the different specific situations in these countries, I expect this European Council to state in very clear terms that the principles of the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and pluralist democracy must be enacted and respected. Democracy is indeed the best way to achieve stability and prosperity in those countries, just like anywhere else.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Friday, the European Council will discuss two areas which are also very important for the future of Europe and its economy: energy and innovation. Both of them are core elements of the Europe 2020 strategy and central to our aim of restoring sustainable growth and increasing the European Union’s competitiveness. And let us not forget that energy and innovation are also two fields where the Community approach and European dimension can offer a lot of value added. This is an important point to make in the current context.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the Europe 2020 strategy we have already agreed on a set of ambitious goals and targets on energy innovation. I could mention the Innovation Union flagship initiative, adopted last October, or the Resource Efficient Europe flagship initiative, adopted just last week and in which energy features prominently.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this week’s European Council should identify clear, concrete deliverables. The discussion and outcome should be as operational and productive as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have described energy policy as the next great European integration project and it is not hard to see why a safe, secure, sustainable, affordable energy supply is key to our economic and strategic interests as a global player. We have already done a lot in the past with our climate and energy package and with internal market legislation. We must build on that by exploiting the opportunities provided by the Lisbon Treaty, deepening our existing cooperation and launching initiatives in new areas like energy security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore the first credibility test of our energy policy is delivering what we have already agreed upon.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has outlined the measures we think are urgently needed in our Energy 2020 and energy infrastructure communications. I want the European Council to endorse these priorities and, in particular, make a clear commitment to completing our internal energy market by 2014. A common technical standard should also be fixed for electric vehicle charging systems this year, as well as for smart grids and meters by the end of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">A truly integrated internal market on energy is key to delivering more growth and jobs, promoting technological progress, modernising our infrastructure and reducing our exposure to import and price volatility.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also ensure that, when it comes to energy, no Member State is isolated from the rest of Europe. I want Member States to agree on a 2015 deadline to put an end to energy islands in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have done good work in connecting the Baltic countries to the continental system. Now I will turn to Central and Eastern Europe to move forward the north-south energy interconnections. I want a plan to be agreed in the autumn on the projects needed to link the Baltic to the Adriatic.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we are on track to achieve our renewables targets, on present performance we will only meet half of our energy efficiency targets. More efficient energy use is the key to unlocking massive environmental and economic benefits – and reducing Europe’s annual energy bill by around EUR 200 billion. It could also create two million jobs by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I will ask the European Council to give new impetus to our pursuit of energy efficiency. We could use the scale of public procurement across the EU to give a real boost to energy efficiency and this means local jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced, jobs for SMEs and real savings for both industry and households.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will adopt in the coming weeks an energy efficiency plan proposing specific measures to boost energy efficiency; for instance, that by 1 January 2012 all Member States should include energy efficiency standards in public procurement. The Commission will then review the progress achieved with these measures by 2013 and will consider further measures, including proposing legally binding targets if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States should agree a deadline for including energy efficiency standards in all public procurement for public buildings and services. For its part, the Commission stands ready to explore new measures in the fields of energy saving for cities, sustainable biofuels, smart grids and energy storage.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to focus on the external dimension of European energy policy. Just a fortnight ago I had encouraging discussions with the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on Europe’s access to the Caspian gas fields, which would enable the realisation of the southern corridor. An important breakthrough was achieved with the signature of a joint declaration with Azerbaijan and a concrete commitment from Turkmenistan to supply gas to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The message I took from that visit is this: when we take key decisions on energy jointly in Europe, we are a strong player in the global race for energy resources. Underlining the importance of the external dimension of the European Union energy policy should be a key message from the European Council, so I am looking forward to a very important discussion on energy at this European Council and – I am happy to say this – here in the European Parliament. I know this Parliament is very supportive of a strong European policy on energy and the President of Parliament has been a champion of a stronger commitment by Europe in terms of energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moving now to innovation, I think there is already broad agreement about what should come out of the European Council. Perhaps less evident is a sense of how urgent, how desperately urgent, action is; why boosting research and innovation is needed now, when Member States are all making difficult choices about where to cut their budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fiscal consideration and public support for innovation are not irreconcilable policies. Several Member States have shown that you can cut your overall budget while maintaining growth-friendly expenditure, in particular on research and innovation. This is important because delivering the innovation economy is the key deep structural change. Our competitors know this, they are already betting on innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">To avoid being left behind, we need the European Council’s endorsement of our strategic and integrated approach to innovation. Innovation needs to be part of our economic policy, not simply a research instrument, as some people think.</p>
      <p sl="en">At European level we can add real value by improving the framework conditions for research and innovation in the European Union. Europe must become the natural home of innovation, through effective standardisation, better use of intellectual property rights, innovation-friendly public procurement and measures to help small innovative companies to secure financing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Much of this does not cost money, but it does need political will. And the political will to take measures using a European approach and a European dimension.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can also squeeze much more out of the European Research Area, making full use of the single market by improving the mobility of researchers, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">And as well as maintaining spending, we need to spend better. With the budget review we have launched a debate on how to simplify the way European Union money is spent, and to work towards a common strategic framework for research and innovation funding. In other words, getting better value for money also means cutting red tape, so that EU-funded scientists can spend more time in the lab or on their work, and not on red tape and bureaucracy. We will never attract the most brilliant scientists and most innovative companies with an incoherent set of funding instruments based on complex and bureaucratic rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this month’s European Council will discuss energy and innovation. But it will not avoid discussing the economy. The economy, the problems of the unemployed, these remain the most important concerns for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have just launched the first European Semester – putting economic governance into action. The Annual Growth Survey was well received. The messages were focused and clear. It provides the necessary guidance at European Union level so that Member States can take our interdependence into account when making their national policy decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Good progress has already been made on the legislative proposals that will underpin our new system of economic governance. I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency. The Hungarian Presidency has my full support in accelerating work to ensure adoption by June.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, as part of this comprehensive response, we will need to resolve the outstanding issues surrounding the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the EFSF, other than widening its scope, what is at stake now is how to increase its effective lending capacity – as stated by the Commission in the Annual Growth Survey.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, this issue should be put in the context of the comprehensive response. The discussions in the European Council of Friday next will most likely cover the need for reinforced coordination of economic policies in the European Union and the euro area. I welcome such a discussion, which fits very well with the Commission’s Annual Growth Survey. In fact, the European Semester is not just about coordinating budgetary policies, but addressing wider issues like macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness gaps.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we have recently heard some authoritative voices arguing in favour of deepening economic governance, but at the same time stating that it can only be done through the intergovernmental method.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to be clear about this: the Commission welcomes the deepening and acceleration of economic governance and policy coordination, including within the euro area. But we are firmly convinced that the Treaty provides the right framework and instruments to achieve this. In fact, we would not further our cause if parallel structures were to work in an ultimately incoherent manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Establishing a system of reinforced economic governance for the EU, and in particular the euro area outside the Union framework, raises important, and politically very sensitive, questions. In fact, Member States should adopt measures which are fully compatible with the Community method and the framework provided by the Treaty. Insofar as measures fall under national competence – and of course some of them are under national responsibility –this competence should be exercised in coherence with the overall Union framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">I really believe this matter is extremely important because we can, in fact, make great progress in matters of economic governance. We need – and we have been arguing in favour of this – more policy coordination and better economic governance, but we have to do it in a way that is coherent and compatible with the Treaties and with a Community approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will be particularly attentive to these issues. The Treaty, with the ensuing ‘Community method’, implies full respect for the role of all the European institutions.</p>

    <intervention id="3-043-000" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what will the European public take away from the meeting of its leaders this Friday in Brussels? Will it understand that European responses to European challenges – the euro, energy, research and innovation and employment – are being sought in good faith? Or rather that, once again, we are surrendering to the sorry spectacle of division and power struggles? What headlines will the major newspapers run? What will people be talking about on Saturday in blogs and on Facebook when they refer to the European Council’s decisions? About the timidity of Europe when faced with the situation of Mediterranean countries which long to have their rights respected, or, on the contrary, about its leadership? Europe’s duty in this regard is quite clear: it must harness all its resources and all its diplomatic skills to aid the transition and the organisation of democratic and open elections.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, as far as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the solution to our problems lies in having more Europe, not less. The solution does not lie in more so-called national victories, but in more common victories and more coordinated responses. The solution does not lie in a lax attitude towards applying our common rules, but in greater discipline. The solution, ladies and gentlemen, does not lie in greater divergences between our budgets, our labour laws and our taxation rates, but in greater convergence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the PPE Group is concerned, there is but one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, which is that, without a common vision and without shared resources, our countries will sink into sluggish growth and plunge into social crisis. If there is just one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, it is that, by thinking, working and investing as Europeans, our countries will emerge from the difficult patch they are going through and will be forever stronger for it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What else will make us react as one if not the difficulties that we have just experienced? Together with the European Commission, the majority of my colleagues in this House and, I am sure, the majority of the 500 million Europeans, I put the following question to the European Council: when are we going to act and react more as one?</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the euro, I now know that that our governments will hold fast and will not allow speculators to destroy 60 years of European integration. I now call on them to concentrate on the consolidation of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, as this is essential. I call on them in particular to strengthen their budgetary discipline and to keep up their efforts to reduce public debt. European governance is the sine qua non of the success of our common project. My group supports it as much as it supports the euro, that is to say, totally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The solution to our problems, as I said at the beginning of my speech, is to have more Europe, not less. While this is true in the cases of employment and the economy, it is also true for energy, a topic which the Council will also cover on Friday. Having more Europe means, first and foremost, fully implementing the laws that already exist in relation to the internal energy market. It can never be emphasised enough that making this market fully operational will make us more competitive, will ensure the security of our supplies and will guarantee a substantial increase in renewable energy production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having more Europe also means encouraging our States to meet the challenge of increasing their energy efficiency by 20% between now and 2020. They were the ones that set themselves this objective. We must ensure that they reach it, or else we shall have to raise the standards they have to meet to do so. Finally, having more Europe in the field of energy means investing more. The Commission estimates that it will cost EUR 1 billion to reach the required infrastructure level. We expect ambitious decisions from the European Council in order to achieve this. Europe needs secure, clean energy just as much as it needs a research and development policy and a policy for promoting industrial innovation. Here too, the solution lies in having more Europe and paying more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. The solution lies in reducing bureaucracy to a minimum and finally reaching an agreement on a European patent. In the area of innovation, too, we expect common solutions from our leaders, not parochial squabbles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to move on from our knee-jerk reactions of the past. Promoting our differences is all well and good, but making them mutually complementary is even better. Taking individual initiatives can be useful, but playing as a team is the way to win the match. Harbouring national ambitions is perfectly legitimate, but understanding that the game is won at international level by playing as a team is the way to guarantee a future for the people of Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="3-044-000" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament held a hearing yesterday, during the course of which we prepared for the energy summit at the weekend. My colleague, Mrs Ulvskog, will relate what we discussed there in more detail later. I will therefore limit myself to two essential elements.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we assess the level of implementation at national level of the 20-20-20 goals that we have adopted, and which were celebrated by some governments of the European Union, no more than 9% of what we have set ourselves is achievable as things currently stand. Thus, as far as energy policy is concerned, this weekend’s summit is a crisis summit, and if we do not put a massive amount of commitment into this, these goals will not be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second comment is that we are seeing a trend on the energy price market that is leading to energy poverty in Europe. Energy and energy supply are starting to be seen as a privilege by a large proportion of households. The additional costs involved in renting are increasing to such an extent that, in future, those on low incomes will have to wear thick jumpers because they cannot heat their homes. Disconnecting people from the energy supply is a question of social injustice. That is also something that an energy summit such as this needs to address.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">However, at this summit we will, of course, find that other things will be discussed, and I would like to pick up on what the President of the Commission said. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany – led by the Federal Chancellor – has done a complete about-turn. Everything that was previously wrong with economic governance, which was a socialist idea, is now suddenly right. Well, it is better late than never. The President of the Commission is right about one thing, however. This about-turn must not lead to a change of direction that upsets the balance of the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">One thing is absolutely clear: all European policy that currently exists within the framework of the current treaties must be dealt with within the existing institutions. At the heart of this is the Commission, and no other institution, and, I might add, for the following key reason: The Commission is the institution that is tied to Parliament in this regard, and parliamentary authorisation for action taken in matters of sovereignty – and monetary issues are key matters of sovereignty – is essential. Therefore, we say ‘yes’ to economic governance, but with its practical implementation based in the Commission and subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament. That is a basic condition for maintaining the balance of the European institutions.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We are in a situation where Europe is faced with internal challenges and also challenges in terms of international policy. I am – and I will say this quite openly here – disturbed by the statements made by some European politicians. I am disturbed by the absence of Europe in a historic process. You make your statement Mr Barroso – excellent. Mr van Rompuy makes his statement – that is also excellent. Baroness Ashton makes a statement – great. Then Mrs Merkel, Mr Sarkozy and Mr Cameron make a statement in a joint communication – and I do not know what is behind this new alliance – that is also great. However, there is no one there – there is no one on the ground who, in direct dialogue with the people who are fighting for their democracy, is talking about how we Europeans can help and support this process.</p>
      <p sl="de">You can write anything you like on paper, but paper will not help us. We must not waste the opportunity that we have here. I will admit that, just in the last week, Mr Cohn-Bendit has made me aware of a great opportunity that has arisen. I have to admit that I did not recognise it at first glance, but the people who are demonstrating on the streets, the people who are leading this revolution, have anything but a religious state on their minds. They want secularism. They want civil democracy. These are our partners. We need to work together with these people to make this a great opportunity for Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, it is also necessary for Mr Mubarak to step down. That would be a positive and encouraging signal. While we are on the subject of our values, our democracy and our freedom of expression, I am pleased that Mrs Győri is here. I would like to say one thing to you, Mrs Győri: I have now read the Hungarian Government’s response to the letter from the Commission. I have to say that the Commission’s letter was excellent. It was a polite question asking whether the Hungarian Government would be so kind as to tell us whether it could possibly agree that the law that it has drawn up might not perhaps be totally in order – and our apologies for asking! The response was: how could you even ask us such a thing; everything is just fine here. This should not happen in Europe. I will say once again: this law is not compatible with fundamental European rules.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">It is not compatible with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. That has been stated very elegantly by Mrs Kroes herself. If this law is not amended, I will feel deceived by the President-in-Office of the Council. The President and the Prime Minister of Hungary said in this House: ‘If the Commission makes comments, we will amend the law.’ The Commission has made comments and I therefore expect Hungary to amend this law. How do we otherwise intend to speak about democracy in the Mediterranean with any credibility if we do not implement it ourselves in Europe?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in times of crisis two strategies are necessary: stop the imminent threat, and take advantage of the opportunities and move forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">In terms of the energy and climate crisis, what is the response from the Council? Quite frankly, I find it both disappointing and embarrassing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The world outside of Europe is facing the energy challenge head on. The US is investing huge amounts of money in green technology. In last week’s State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama emphasised energy efficiency and the possibilities offered by green technology.</p>
      <a text="(The President briefly intervened on a procedural matter)"/>
      <p sl="de">President Obama even compared these new technologies to the space race and called it our generation’s Sputnik moment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, in the Council, where is our ‘put a man on the moon’ project in Europe? You do not even dare to discuss a binding energy efficiency target. Energy efficiency is the favourite theme of every energy speaker or politician, and the Council defers it until 2012.</p>
      <p sl="de">China is investing heavily in research and new technologies. Today China has more than 400 photovoltaic companies. Ten years ago they had zero per cent of the world market. Now they have 23%. Ten years ago they had zero per cent of the wind market. They have 50% now.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are we doing in Europe? The competition and innovation programme, the CIP, is struggling for support and the financing for SET, the strategic energy technology programme, is at less than half. That is where we are compared to China and the US. We even have Member States which are already planning for a 30% reduction in emissions, like Germany, but the Council does not dare to move; neither does the Commission, by the way. According to a recent joint report from Barclays and Accenture, the shift to a low-carbon economy is leading to a remarkable development of sustainable low-carbon technologies. So the banks are moving.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, where is the European leadership? The Council is haggling about the energy target. Nor do you see that the Member States are fulfilling the third energy market package and there is even a debate on funding for research and innovation in the long-term budget. That is where we are in Europe, and the Council shows no leadership at all when it comes to energy, climate, competitiveness and jobs. That is where we stand.</p>

I must ask you, Mr Schulz, where were you between 2002 and 2010, when your socialist comrades in power in Hungary had every single anti-government protest dispersed by force? Where were you on 23 October 2006, when fourteen people were ordered to be shot in the eye with rubber bullets fired at head height? Where were you in autumn 2006, when several hundred people were, as already established by final court (the President interrupted the speaker) I have one minute, President, don’t I, according to the Rules?

      <p sl="de">Between 2002 and 2010 – in order to give you a clear answer – Hungary was, as it is now, a democratic state based on the rule of law with a left-leaning government governing according to democratic rules. So far, I have no doubt that this also remains the case in Hungary today under a conservative government. There is one thing I am sure of, however, and that is that your party is a right-wing extremist, neo-fascist party.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent reports from the southern Mediterranean and Egypt state that shots are being fired in Cairo. The situation is coming to a head. As a result of this news, I can only appeal to the European Heads of State or Government not to wait until lunch time on Friday of this week to agree on what the right message for Egypt should be. It is long overdue for us to make it clear to Mr Mubarak that he has to stand down swiftly, this being necessary in order to prevent this unrest in Egypt from escalating further and to ensure that developments follow a similar path to those previously seen in Tunisia. It would be really disgraceful if we were to simply wait to see what happens in Egypt.</p>

      <p sl="de">This summit is actually supposed to be an energy summit. However, when I see the preparations that are being made for it, I am actually not surprised that other topics are now setting the agenda. On the basis of the slogan ‘we need security of energy supply’, a lot of contact – by you in particular, Mr Barroso – is being made with countries like Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. Mr Oettinger recently spoke in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy about how we are going to develop our energy relations with Iraq, Georgia and Turkmenistan.</p>
      <p sl="de">In view of the events in the southern Mediterranean, where we are also seeing the consequences of our policies relating to our own interests and our external energy policy, I consider this to be rather hazardous. I know we need diversification because we also face a problematic and very difficult situation to the east with Russia and the transit countries of Belarus and Ukraine. However, diversification must not involve us now entering into relations with despots and countries in crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Energy efficiency and renewable energies are the solution for a better and more secure energy supply, and I have to say, Mr Barroso, you have tolerated a great deal in this regard. Mr Oettinger has neglected the area that was managed well by Mr Piebalgs, or – and this is the negative way of looking at it – he has once again chosen not to promote future-proof technologies such as renewable energies and energy efficiency and has reverted to the old energy mix. Suddenly we find that feed-in tariffs for nuclear power stations, for atomic energy, are to be discussed at the summit – good grief, where do we actually stand in this modernisation and innovation debate? I have simply lost patience with this now.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps we have actually been too patient where economic governance is concerned. Germany now seems to be following the Schäuble course. However, what we currently have on the table still does not represent the state of the art. We need more than a minor amendment to the stability instrument. We urgently need to take a decision to amend the credit conditions for Greece and Ireland or we will end up destroying these countries. We need more money in the crisis instrument, otherwise we can forget any ideas of providing assistance to Spain and Portugal in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we need at long last – just so that we understand each other very clearly on this point – is a proposal for how we intend to deal with the restructuring of debt. We cannot avoid it, everyone knows that, and we, as Parliament, also want to discuss it further here.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, energy security is an area which the EU should get involved in, and where it should act with the greatest possible degree of unity and coordination, which is not the case with many other European initiatives, and therefore we, as the European Conservatives and Reformists, support the creation of a common energy market, as this will strengthen the position of Member States vis-à-vis the main suppliers, while also limiting the scope for some suppliers of strategic raw materials to abuse their dominant position in order to play foreign policy games. At the same time, however, we believe that the process of energy integration should respect specific national factors, in other words national energy mixes, including the use of nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the financial side, I would like to say that my group is predominantly made up of parties from countries that do not belong to the eurozone, and which do not use the euro. This does not mean, however, that we wish to see a weak, fragile and unstable eurozone, or that we would like the euro to fail. On the other hand, I would like to state clearly that the recovery of the EU economy and financial stability must not lead to further supra-national tendencies, or fiscal federalisation, and must not become a pretext for the further transfer of powers from the national to the European level. We are completely opposed to that!</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to make some comments on the events in North Africa - in Tunisia and Egypt. There are considerable similarities here to the events in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989. We very much welcome the democratising tendencies in these countries and we should support them. We want the immediate neighbourhood of the EU to be stable and democratic. At the same time, however, we should take care that the justified efforts and calls of the people in these countries do not, on the other hand, go awry and do not lead to undemocratic, authoritarian, religious dictatorships. The EU should proceed in such a way as to prevent this from happening.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as we know, the energy sector is vital to the creation of new jobs, so opportunity should be the order of the day and the watchword for the Council for which we are currently preparing; unfortunately, it is not.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are in need of specific investment to tackle energy efficiency in our cities, in particular in the countries being subjected to the most serious speculative attacks and, above all, in the countries with the highest levels of unemployment. However, the responses offered by governments continue to follow old formulae and it is these that we still try to impose.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What we need in this Council is an energy revolution. We do not just need more public-private partnerships: that is persisting with failure. We remain very tied to the old energy sources – to fossil fuels and nuclear energy – and very lacking in ambition with regard to new energy sources, which are the only ones that can ensure equality of access and the only ones which can ensure that large-scale projects are as important as local projects. Only by combining everything could we have a truly integrated policy, and that is why this Council will continue as before, rather than break with the past as it should.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would ask your permission to appeal for just one more thing: emergency situations require emergency appeals, so the appeal that I am requesting your permission to make is for Europe’s leaders to have, in relation to what is happening in Egypt, at least as much solidarity with the people in the street as they had with the authoritarian regimes, whose governance was all about the economy and did not respect democracy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council summit is taking place at a time when there are a ridiculous number of other urgent topics in addition to the one that was intended for debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Schulz rightly mentioned that we are all expecting the European Council to make a statement with regard to Egypt and what is happening there and for it to concern itself with this matter. That is correct. Mr Schulz, I could have agreed with you completely on this if you had not made the mistake in the second part of your speech of once again making a cheap party political show by arguing with the Hungarians. That has absolutely nothing to do with it, we are currently talking about the Council and about the topics that are on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Harms, I would also like to make one thing clear about what you said. When you rightly say that these pressing issues – economic issues, issues relating to the euro and to Egypt – need to be dealt with, you cannot then also accuse Commissioner Oettinger of no longer dealing with the energy issue adequately. That is absurd. This is due to the fact that the Council has to deal with other matters as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether or not energy policy suits you or if other people have a different opinion does not make it good or bad. It cannot be evaluated according to such a criterion. I think that the Commission has made very thorough and sensible preparations for the summit in the last few months. It has not been following the principle of constantly making new demands. Instead, it makes sound and thorough preparations and then takes measures that will actually result in change.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, Mr Schulz – he is not even listening, but that does not matter, this is just the parliamentary debating game where we blatantly talk at cross purposes.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">You spoke about poverty that can arise as a result of energy prices. You are absolutely right. However, Mr Schulz, to be fair we then have to ask the question: why are energy prices so high? What is the reason for this? What part do we play in this when we adopt political measures that constantly send prices souring? That is also a contributing factor – not the only one – but it should also be included in an honest debate and we need to take into account the new requirements that are being adopted here continually from morning to night.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, this summit provides an enormous opportunity for us finally to move forward on the issue of infrastructure and to ensure that investment in infrastructure and energy is undertaken, because all other issues depend on us managing to do this. There arises the question of prices, reliability and also of whether we integrate renewable energies properly into the network, and for this we unfortunately need considerable investment. Moreover, the state will not be able to bear this cost alone.</p>

This comes only a few weeks after the Renewable Energy Directive, of which all of us here were very proud, entered into force. As regards thorough preparations on the subject of energy efficiency: what is your view of the fact that the energy efficiency action plan is still lying in a drawer and so there would in fact be absolutely no chance of debating it at the summit?</p>

There are also politicians who make sound preparations and implement initiatives. That is exactly the point. I do not believe in continually making new demands, and therefore Mr Oettinger is absolutely right. First, let us do what we have already committed ourselves to.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Schulz quite rightly pointed out that in many Member States the matter of efficiency leaves a lot to be desired and that many Member States have not yet achieved their renewable energy quotas. We are fairly good, but not good enough. In other words, we are still a long way from where we want to be.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, as Mr Schulz mentioned earlier, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament held an alternative energy summit yesterday. We did this at a time when more and more families and citizens are unable to afford to keep their homes warm, while at the same time industry, which is dependent on energy and needs to be competitive, has been plagued by difficulties. Another reason for doing this was the fact that initiatives at the highest political level in the EU have been very few and far between and extremely weak in this area. In response to what Mr Reul said – some things have been initiated but then have simply remained on paper and got no further than the office drawer.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our message from the alternative energy summit for tomorrow’s EU summit is very simple and clear. Take action; do something – here and now. Ensure that we have binding energy efficiency targets that are actually complied with. For example, there are around 190 million buildings in the EU that need to be heated. Investments in them in order to prevent the current energy leakage would provide both financial benefits and new jobs. Invest in renewable energy sources, unless you believe that those we have are infinite, and invest in distribution networks that are modern and efficient for all types of energy. Give consumers and citizens strong and clear rights in relation to energy companies. Ensure that the energy market is both transparent and capable of being monitored. Just as we do not want a financial market that does not function properly and that is closed and completely unregulated, we do not want an electricity market that operates like the financial market did before the crisis either.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Use radical initiatives to show that energy demand is a question of social responsibility and political decisions rather than a private matter for individual citizens to cope with on their own. Demonstrate, just as Mr Schulz said, that we understand that energy policy is also social policy, industrial policy and a policy for the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think the importance of energy is clear from the fact that Mr Van Rompuy is not here, as he is giving a press briefing, and Mr Barroso has left. So much for how important they think it is to listen to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday, at the invitation of the S&amp;D Group, Jeremy Rifkin was in Brussels and he clearly set out a new economic vision. Firstly, renewables, which is something we have in place with the directive. Secondly, every building consuming 40% of our energy today can be transformed into a low-energy building by using renewables, even in a positive-energy building. Thirdly, I think we have broad agreement here that electricity grids need to be speeded up. Fourthly, we have to use the next R&amp;D to develop storage technologies and, finally, electric plug-ins.</p>
      <p sl="en">With these five, and of course what Fiona has mentioned under the umbrella of efficiency in all sectors, we would, firstly, make our European economy one that is much less dependent geopolitically. Secondly, we would save EUR 300 billion in transfers outside the European economy and use that to invest in jobs and other investments here. Thirdly, the race for green technologies is on; you only have to read the new Chinese five-year plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">If, in the next months, we do not create the framework for Europe being the lead market for all these technologies, we will lose out on one of the few sectors where we are still leading the world economy. It is such a pity that this is a summit that is not well prepared – Mr Van Rompuy is partly responsible for that, as is Mr Oettinger. He has not prepared something that is well thought through on efficiency and on renewables and has spent the last three months being the Trojan horse for two or three big German power companies who wanted to destroy the renewables industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, something we have achieved: Mr Oettinger has a 26-to-1 chance of defeat in destroying the national support schemes. Only the Netherlands is supporting him. This is a considerable victory and renewables will continue. That is the number one energy of the future.</p>

Spending public money on energy matters only makes sense if it helps us meet security demands. The European Union’s energy security depends on a broad diversification, which presupposes not only new transmission routes, but also access to new sources of fuels. Otherwise we will repeat the mistakes made in the TEN-T programme, which has claimed that projects such as Nord Stream are European. We do not need any more new ways to pump more of the same Russian fuel onto the European market. If we repeat the same old mistakes, our EUR 1 billion will only buy us the pretence of a market and competition.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I am expecting the energy summit to produce, above all, a comprehensive, but also intelligible and responsible approach to the interests of our citizens. According to the last Eurostat surveys, energy price stability is one of the main priorities for a large proportion of EU inhabitants. It is no accident that the Czech Republic leads the field in this statistic. An irresponsible political and economic lobby in the Czech Republic has promoted inadequate financial support for solar power plants. The wild rush of speculators, including foreign ones, and their pursuit of sky-high profits is setting the public against renewables as such, because the people are facing an unnecessarily large increase in energy costs. It is certainly not easy to secure sufficient energy at acceptable prices, but we can at least get close to it. In my opinion, the answer is, among other things, to push for a balanced energy mix, from renewables to nuclear, and to reject extreme viewpoints from both sides. Only in this way will we win the trust of EU citizens, whom we are here to represent, after all.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council needs to look at the fact that Europe’s production system has no defence against the volatility of oil prices on the markets, because futures markets are being held hostage to sophisticated international financial speculation, meaning that prices now have very little to do with the fundamental principles of supply and demand. The Council must set itself the goal of providing the European Union with a practical instrument with which to create a regulated market, open to selected traders and managed by a completely trustworthy European partner.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the thrust of an Italian Government proposal to create a European oil exchange aimed at establishing a stable oil market, which would be of huge benefit to businesses and consumers. Speculators’ enthusiasm for commodities is influencing oil prices, which are no longer based on the spot market, since the cumulative effect of advances and speculative manoeuvres ends up determining supply and demand in the real market. A European exchange would transform the current ‘non-market’ of paper barrels into an efficient, regulated and monitored real market based on real barrels of oil.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the European Council is discussing the topics of energy security and innovation simultaneously. Undoubtedly, energy security cannot be discussed without including innovation. Naturally, we believe that the construction of a north-south pipeline in addition to the east–west one is important, but this will not even come close to solving the problems arising from the issue of energy supply. What is more, dependency will not be reduced significantly; it is only the direction of dependency that will change. Dependency can only be minimised in the long term if we shift emphasis from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources from now on.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is precisely in the spirit of these that I notice a lack of emphasis on the topic of renewable energy among the priorities for innovation. In this regard, there are two things in particular that we must mention: on one hand, that renewable energy sources must be affordable, meaning that the population must not be given additional burdens for using renewable energy. On the other hand, dependency outside the European Union must not be allowed to turn into dependency within the EU, that is, the less developed new Member States, including Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, must be allowed to catch up in terms of renewable energy sources with those old Member States that are currently major powers in renewable energy sources, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, or Austria for that matter.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Energy is at the heart of the European social pact for prosperity. Fifty per cent of our energy supply comes from outside the Union. We urgently need to diversify supply and make it more secure and more ‘non-carbon’. This is our energy, and it is the security that we owe our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This leads me, President-in-Office, to call on you too to support the commitments we have made internationally with the ITER, or fusion, project. This technology is secure, it is sustainable, it is free and it is infinite. The European Council, as the highest political authority, would do well to support this project in its dealings with the international community.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This brings me on to the subject of research and innovation. Since the 1980s, the research and development framework programmes have been Europe’s instruments for intervention. EUR 53 billion have been earmarked for the period 2007-2013. What stage have we reached? We have been waiting for four months, Commissioner, for your communication on the revision of the seventh research framework programme. Mr Barroso said: ‘Less red tape’. He is quite right. We are caught in an administrative stranglehold, and those engaged in research are turning away from European programmes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to draw your attention to the urgent need not only to simplify future procedures but also to settle past conflicts, because we have a problem of trust with the research institutes. In this connection I should like to thank Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn for her outstanding work.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, yesterday our group held an alternative energy summit in which we demanded binding 20% energy efficiency and 30% renewable energy by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="es">Instead of focusing on our demands in detail, something that some of my colleagues have done, I would like to emphasise a point without which the targets above are not possible: infrastructure. The question is: do we really want a European market where a third of the energy provided is renewable energy? If the response is yes, should we not be talking about binding 10% interconnections by 2020?</p>
      <p sl="es">The implementation of the renewable energy targets requires a network with a greater degree of meshing, intelligence and, above all, interconnectivity in order to manage its variability properly. However, we are far from achieving the 10% target set in the European Council in Barcelona almost a decade ago. Nine states have still not reached this target today; I am sure you would agree with me that if we want to be successful, we need this target to have the same degree of adherence as the previous ones.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, I would like to convey our group’s desire for much more ambitious conclusions from the next summit to the President-in-Office of the Council; conclusions that talk of 30% renewable energy levels, 20% efficiency and 10% interconnections, all of which are binding.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also just like to touch on the subject of innovation: another area in which we would like to see more ambition in the Council conclusions is innovative government procurement. In my group we understand the awarding of contracts for innovative products, processes and services to be one of the key elements for boosting innovation in the market place.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are especially interested in promoting and analysing its link with European associations for innovation within the EU framework for innovation. This is another item that the Council ought not to ignore.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, investing in energy infrastructure is to me the starting point in fulfilling our policy goals, ensuring that our citizens and businesses have access to secure and affordable energy in a functioning internal market and achieving the Commission’s ambitious energy infrastructure package, which I see as a positive step.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we should be pragmatic as well as ambitious. Instead of pouring buckets of euros into grand projects, we should focus on identifying and financing smaller, cost-efficient and pragmatic projects that can make a significant difference, such as better interconnections. I think we should consider EU project bonds as a solution to encourage needed investment in infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, overall, this crisis forces us to adopt a reasonable, open and integrated approach to our energy policy: first, by taking into consideration all components of the energy mix without considering them – or at least some of them – morally unacceptable, and secondly, with an integrated road map, reconciling our sometimes contradictory climate, supply security and competitiveness targets.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we already know that deepening the single market will mean greater liberalisation and, therefore, increased monopolistic concentration, to the benefit of the largest economic groups in the European Union’s more developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would like to make plain our opposition to this route in areas, like those relating to energy, that are strategic to economic and social development, particularly that of the countries on the periphery. However, the most serious issue is that everything mentioned here by the Council and Commission – not least on strengthening so-called ‘economic governance’ – ignores the reality of social problems, of worsening inequalities, of unemployment, of social exclusion, and of energy poverty. This last is growing exponentially in some countries with the rise in electricity and fuel prices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Economic policy and energy policy should have a central goal: social progress and improving our peoples’ living conditions; however, what is happening is the opposite. This, therefore, is the reason for the indignation that we can see growing in the streets in many of our countries, and now in Tunisia and Egypt too. We express our solidarity with the peoples of those countries and we want their rights to be respected, specifically by the Council, which should take a clear position on all this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the extent to which the EU needs ‘energy energising’ today is obvious if we look at the energy security issue, the geopolitical situation around us and energy policy itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Union should not be – as in the case of Egypt and Tunisia – failing to keep up with events. To quote my colleague Mr Gahler, however, the US is one step behind the events, the Member States are one step behind the US, and Brussels is one step behind the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Four years ago we had a serious energy crisis, and in 2007 we adopted an energy security report in this House. Four years later we are at the very initial stages of a common energy policy and energy security. It is very important that this Council, this forthcoming summit, translates the change from words into action.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need physical security, and not only plans and documents and words and papers. The time has come to wake up. What if something bad happens in geopolitical terms in northern Africa and the Middle East? A great tectonic change is taking place before our eyes. Oil now costs USD 100 again. If, in the worst case scenario, the Suez Canal should be blocked, how prepared are we as a Union to ensure security of supply? Where are we? After four years of lost time, we are not prepared for the next energy crisis if it happens.</p>
      <p sl="en">For that reason the key expectation is that the European Council should provide a real change in terms of a genuine internal market for energy and genuine security of supply in a material and physical sense.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the first energy summit in the history of the European Union will take place on Friday, because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union has direct responsibilities in this sector for the first time. I agree with Mr Barroso that energy policy may be the European Union’s next big integration project. There are very many aspects to this, and President Buzek has always said that we need an energy community in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where this summit was concerned, there were many hopes and expectations that the European Union’s strategic questions with regard to energy supply would be answered. What are the strategic questions? Yes, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, they include the EU’s dependence on energy imports. They include the enormous amount of energy that is still being wasted, and there are also the negative consequences of the current energy system on ecosystems and in particular on the Earth’s atmosphere. When I look at the Council conclusions, I have to say that this energy summit is going to be a huge disappointment, because it will not answer any of these major questions. It has actually been poorly prepared in terms of the common vision that we need and it has also been poorly prepared in terms of the coherence of the resources and instruments that we use.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like mention once again that yesterday, at the alternative energy summit of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, a five pillar concept was proposed for how we can answer these strategic questions, how we can reduce energy imports and energy wastage and, of course, how we can eliminate the negative impact on the environment. The proposed means for achieving this were through the development of renewable energies, through energy efficiency and through the use of information technology to interlink these different energy sources. That is an innovation summit. I have not heard of information technology being used as a strategic factor before. I therefore believe that we need a technological revolution, and this summit ought to be setting us on the right course. However, I have the impression that it is going in the wrong direction.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the forthcoming meeting of the European Council will be set against the backdrop of the continuing capitalist crisis and stiffening competition between the monopolies, both within the European Union and between the European Union and other imperialist centres, for energy and innovation. These are two vital sectors for capital. Large areas, such as the Middle East, Asia and Africa, are the scene for stiff imperialist competition and intervention to control wealth-producing resources and energy transportation routes, which is causing tremendous poverty, harsh exploitation and repression, in collaboration with the bourgeois classes at home and to the detriment of the people. This reactionary policy is giving rise to popular uprisings, such as those breaking out right now in Egypt and other countries, thereby proving that the people are the protagonists of history.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Greek Communist Party expresses its solidarity with the people protesting in Egypt. It calls on the people to express their real support and solidarity. The basic priority of the summit, which is not formally included in its agenda but which will be discussed, is the EU 2020 strategy. Priorities in terms of implementing reinforced economic governance will be moving in the same direction.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have no doubt that this Council will be very important, essentially for matters relating to the recovery of Europe’s economies, in particular energy and innovation. I therefore cannot fail to stress that, basically, this Council is part of the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy: it is part of that half – that side of the coin – that is the side of growth, competitiveness and economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, because this is so important, I should like to make an appeal here, which is why I have taken the floor. In addition to subjects as important as energy and innovation, I call on this Council to debate and draw up a solution to the financial crisis that the European Union is experiencing. I believe that we do not have time to waste.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, if we cannot expect a solution to this problem from Friday’s Council, and even if we have to wait until March’s Council meeting for it, it is essential for the Heads of State or Government to prepare to make the stability fund more flexible, starting on 4 February, along with preparing the relaunch of the European economic government.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that this matter is fundamental and cannot remain on the margins of this Council. Now, if you will permit me, I would like to make another point about this Council: I hope that it will also draw up a European Union strategy for the Mediterranean; I hope that it will draw up a response to the situations currently being experienced in Tunisia and Egypt. In other words, despite the importance of the issues of energy and innovation, I hope that the issues of the financial crisis and of the political crisis in North Africa will be tackled by this Council.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would ask members to take a look at Mr Van Rompuy’s invitation to the next Council meeting. In it, he says ‘We are going to talk about energy, and I would particularly like to focus on energy supply and energy security’. However, the Council is engaging in the wrong debate. Energy supply and energy security are important, of course they are, but primarily only within the framework of a more global objective, and in particular within the framework of an energy system which will be completely independent and completely sustainable in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Obviously, I agree with many of the things that have been said, but I would like to steer the debate some way further ahead to the future. Although he is not with us right now, Mr Reul, the Chair of our Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, has said that politicians should not put forward too many new proposals. Well, he is wrong about that. It is the task of politicians to have a vision for the future and to formulate objectives accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Our objective should be to switch entirely to renewable energy by 2050. It is not just a few individual politicians or a number of political groups that are saying that. No, scientists are saying that that is perfectly feasible if we start doing the right things now to enable us to achieve this objective by 2050. There is, then, the question of energy efficiency, as well, as many members have pointed out. Incidentally, Mr Barroso has said many good things about that and I hope with all my heart that the Commissioner in charge will be able to deliver the goods.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, we need to make huge investments in renewable energy: locally, at district level, but also in a number of special major projects, such as the North Sea Ring and major projects relating to solar panels.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally – and that is where Europe has a very special task – we need an energy network which will ensure that all of that becomes a reality. It is the responsibility of the European Union to provide the funding and the Council ought to make decisions next Friday.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the energy summit may put the European Union back on track for economic growth. In its ambition to become the most sustainable global economy it must devise a new energy vision for Europe. A coherent, Community approach is required for both production and efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Production means sources, transport and distribution. The Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions have new energy sources which can be developed over long periods of time. New transport routes can be created in this region. The Southern Corridor and, in particular, the Nabucco pipeline are of paramount importance in this respect. The Danube Strategy can also help develop new gas or oil supply routes. We cannot discuss a common policy without having a common energy network. Interconnection between national networks is the first step towards a single internal energy market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Energy efficiency is a must. Steps have been taken in this direction, but the Union needs to implement the action plan in this area in the years ahead. Energy efficiency will have a huge impact on economic growth, the methods used to cut CO2 emissions and on creating jobs in areas such as IT, construction and services.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, energy and innovation are very important issues, which are fundamental to the Europe 2020 strategy, and can contribute to smart, sustainable growth, and to creating more and better jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In fact, energy and innovation are areas in which my country, Portugal, has been making large-scale investments with good results. In recent years, Portugal has doubled its investment in R&amp;D and has reached the top five in terms of renewable energy: 31% of electricity consumed already comes from renewable sources and this figure is expected to be 60% in 2020.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, as has already been said, this Council cannot ignore what is happening in Egypt: a popular revolution. Nor can it ignore the financial and economic crisis. The eurozone Member States in the greatest difficulties are doing what they should by adopting austerity measures, which are needed in order to contain the deficit and calm the markets. These measures require great sacrifices from families and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As for the EU, is it doing what it should? I do not think so. The European response in the face of attacks on the euro by speculators – because it is through sovereign debt that speculators are attacking the single currency – has been piecemeal, late and ineffective. The diagnosis has been made and the prescription is well known: the European Union must improve economic coordination, and make the European financial stabilisation fund stronger and more flexible, so that it can buy the public debt of the countries under the greatest pressure from the markets. In other words, we are facing global problems requiring a global response. That is also what the public expects from the upcoming European Council.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, special times call for special policies and, certainly, now that we are trying to haul ourselves out of the crisis, it is a good thing that space has been found on the Council’s agenda for energy and innovation, specifically. They are key factors for European competitiveness and also for employment in the near future. We have had enough figures and reports. We now have to move forward and make progress.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The field of cross-border infrastructure and interconnections, in particular, is where we are very much lagging behind. We should now move on with new instruments, such as project bonds and use European Investment Bank guarantees to make greater efforts to enable investment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second point, obviously, is innovation. The European Scoreboard on Innovation was published this week and you see there that some countries are lagging behind. This is understandable in a time of crisis, but should we not be mobilising other instruments, as well? The structural funds, for example, which require public co-finance to bring initiatives to completion. At precisely the time when we are almost totally failing to do this, a lot more emphasis needs to be placed on public investment and innovation. The Minister has also suggested that. This kind of innovation should move things forward without us immediately having to be ready to inject more money. That would definitely help us achieve the 2020 objectives of sustainability, smart action and getting people into work. I wish you success.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, in the field of energy, we have set ourselves objectives which cover all three pillars of the common energy policy: competitiveness, sustainability and the security of supply. In order to achieve these objectives, we have already adopted two extensive packages: the first being the climate and energy package and the second being the liberalisation package. For this reason, I do not think that we need any new legislation in the field of energy; instead, I think we should focus more on implementing the existing legislation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">What is the use of putting additional requirements down on paper, and ever more stringent requirements at that, if we fail to implement the existing ones? We need to improve the Union's credibility, which is why I am saying that we do not need any new requirements to improve energy efficiency. Businesses and households need to make decisions according to market conditions. So far, improving efficiency has been regarded as the most economical measure, a win-win situation, as it were, and I really see no need for new binding targets.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We must also create an environment which will encourage investment in infrastructure. It is the market that has to act, not public funds from European and national budgets. We have to avoid government subsidies and non-market mechanisms which lead to the centralisation of the economy, hamper competition and stifle creativity. Energy is part of the ETS and carbon price must be the main driver of development.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In the field of energy, we also need improved cross-border coordination and strategic planning for new infrastructure.

      <p sl="en">As a rule, interconnections are absent in those Member States where the natural gas sector is dominated by an incumbent operator.

There are already a vast number of methanol stations in China but, in Europe, this type of energy supply only exists in Iceland.

Tabled before the Council is the issue of the strategy and, at the same time, that of the infrastructure required for its implementation. I hope that the outcome will confirm our expectations, and on 4 February we can witness the creation of a real common European energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If you would allow me one final thought, Mr President. I would like to state that I welcome the correspondence between the European Commission and the Hungarian Government on the matter of the Hungarian media law. I am glad that the dialogue is following the procedural course usual in such matters. This should reassure everyone who has a stake in the resolution of the issue. I am convinced that the case could be closed within a few weeks. Any further malicious and unfounded political attacks will be redundant. I hold the belief that it is this that is in the interest of the EU, and not that which was unfortunately demonstrated today in a speech in this House.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The coming decade will be crucial for the entire European Union, because the Member States will have to take serious decisions: to replace existing resources and infrastructure and meet increasing demand for energy, which will be essential for European economic development in the future. This European Council on Energy really is very important. It may become an historic event if there is agreement on specific principles for the development of the internal energy market. This would truly enable all 27 European Union Member States to coordinate their actions and focus their efforts on making our economic environment greater and more competitive, on increasing jobs and reducing social exclusion. I feel that it is very important for specific calendars to be set, which would allow energy islands in the Member States to be reduced or eliminated. To achieve this it is particularly important to muster political will and solidarity and to ensure that we develop not only projects that are commercially attractive, but ones that are necessary for the European Union. I believe that it is also very important to set binding schedules for Member States, so that they comply on time with their obligations to implement these projects. Although investment decisions usually depend on market players, political decisions are also of huge significance in establishing a stable and transparent investment environment.</p>

    <intervention id="3-088-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate clearly confirms that both energy and innovation are absolutely crucial for the future of Europe and the future of the European economy. Clearly we would all agree that, if we take the right steps now, not only can we make an important contribution to economic recovery in the short term, but we can also make our European economy much more competitive in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree with all of you who called for concrete deliverables and for concrete actions to be taken. The Commission is therefore pushing very hard to have very clear targets. We would like to have a real internal market in the field of energy by 2014. We must finally unlock the potential of the internal market in this very important field of the economy. To give just one figure: if we do this right, consumers can save EUR 13 billion by having the possibility of getting electricity from a cheaper provider. This is more than EUR 100 per year per consumer, and this is just the beginning. Therefore we need to push the European Council to take real ownership of the internal market in the field of energy and to exercise ownership in relation to the very important transposition of the legislation, not only at European level but also at national level in each and every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I listened very carefully to our MEPs from the Baltic countries. I think it is high time to overcome the situation whereby we have isolated energy islands. Therefore 2015 is the right time for finalising the work on this very important project and getting our Baltic Member States connected to the real European grid.</p>
      <p sl="en">If there was something with which I did not completely agree, it was the statement on Barack Obama’s State of the Union address. I listened to this and I must say I felt that it was very much inspired by what we do here in Europe – what we suggested in the EU 2020 strategy. He spoke about energy efficiency, the importance of education, the new impetus on protection of the environment, and the reduction of poverty. These are precisely the goals we have set for ourselves for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I really believe that we are leaders where environmental policies are concerned. You can check the position of the European Union in all environmental summits, and see the energy invested in bringing the whole world onto the right course in this particular field. Concerning our goals – our famous 2020 goals – we are doing quite well regarding the reduction of emissions. We are also doing quite well in increasing the share of renewable resources in all our energy production.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it is true – and I have to admit this here – that we are lagging behind in meeting the targets for energy efficiency. Therefore we, as a Commission, will monitor development in this field very closely and we will have a review of the targets in 2013. I can promise you that, if the results are not ambitious enough, we will seriously consider imposing legally binding targets for this field as well. We all know that the cleanest energy is safe energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the comments on the innovation economy, here I think it is very clear that we have to raise the level of innovation priorities and innovation policies. We have to unlock the potential that has existed in Europe in this field for many years. We can see that, as regards closing our innovation gap with the USA and Japan, we are not doing as well as we would have expected to. We can see how emerging economies are closing on us, so we have to focus on this area as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to analyse the real causes of our lack of ambitious progress. One of them has been mentioned, namely the problem of red tape, bureaucracy and over-complicated rules. Therefore the Commission has already suggested – and this was adopted last week – a simplification of the rules for the Seventh Framework Programme for all innovation policies. I think we will all have a good opportunity in the context of the next multiannual financial framework discussion to improve the way in which we execute and implement European programmes, because we will also be discussing financial regulations. We have to look very carefully for a balance between appropriate control and the necessary flexibility in programme execution, so that we do not create additional red tape in relation to programmes which are especially important for the promotion of innovation policies in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The economy will, of course, be discussed as well. The February European Council meeting will be a meeting of transition and a search for a comprehensive approach to the current economic challenges in Europe, whether in relation to the eurozone or in the field of improved economic governance for the whole European Union. I can assure you that the Commission is relentless in proposing measures to stabilise the situation in the financial market and in seeking long-term solutions. We believe that all this must constitute a comprehensive response which will allow us, finally, to move out of reactive mode and to plan for long-term measures and a long-term strengthening of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding comments on Treaty change and on the setting-up of the permanent European Stability Mechanism, the Commission is convinced that the Treaty provides the right framework for further reinforcement of economic governance. It is quite clear that to do this outside the Union framework raises political and institutional issues which will have to be very carefully examined by the Commission. I am sure that the leaders will discuss this issue too in Friday’s European Council meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in Egypt and Tunisia was discussed this morning in the College of Commissioners. There was clear support for the legitimate aspirations of the people of Egypt and clear confirmation that the Commission stands ready to step up its assistance to Egypt and its people in this transition. The discussion on the situation in Tunisia and Egypt will follow and I am sure that my colleague Cathy Ashton will be able to address it in more precise terms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the speakers for all the comments and interventions. I witnessed an extremely valuable discussion here in Parliament, which will contribute to Friday’s discussion by the heads of state and government on energy and innovation issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wholeheartedly understand Parliament saying that what we are doing for energy or innovation is not enough. We are very committed to the Lisbon Treaty’s provision on the formation of the European internal energy market; we are greatly committed to moving in that direction. Of course, please encourage us to do more in this field. I do not want to go into details because I think Vice-President Šefčovič was very detailed on all the aspects of the future common energy policy in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same for innovation. We all believe that we have to put more things on the table concerning innovation; the Innovation Union is a great investment in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">A strong Europe cannot live without strong common policies and European energy and European innovation policy should be one of those.</p>
      <p sl="en">My question to Mr Schulz is why he allowed me answer as a representative of the Hungarian Government. I think Mr Schulz read a different letter from the letter we sent to the Commission. He said that the Hungarian Government neglected the Commission consensus and was not ready to take it into consideration. Let me quote certain lines from this letter, beginning with the statement that the Government of the Republic of Hungary is ready to amend the law on the media. ‘The modification of the legislation could be considered’. ‘The Hungarian Government is also prepared to examine the possibility of finding other legal solutions if necessary’. Finally, ‘if the Commission … still deems it necessary’ after the consultations ‘to amend the Hungarian regulation …, we are prepared to commence drafting these modifications’.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, I would just like to inform you that, as is clearly stated in the letter, there is a consultation. We are ready. The Commission yesterday said it was pleased that the answer had arrived. Experts will get down to business and it is our job to find a solution to this kind of problem. I very much hope that in the future all kinds of discussions will be dedicated to energy and innovation and not mix up the presidency with some aspects of certain political parties.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This Council is adopting energy and innovation as subjects for debate. The proposal is to integrate and ‘complete’ the single market for electricity and gas. We are well aware that this stated goal has been synonymous with limits to the Member States’ full exercising of their social role through properly equipped, financed and active public services, and that it has been synonymous with liberalisations and privatisations, followed sooner or later by the inevitable monopolistic concentration at EU level. There will therefore be no difference in this strategic area of vital importance. In the midst of this, and as the easiest means of making this route viable, issues are being raised (demagogically) relating to the security of energy supply: these are certainly important, and must be considered and resolved, but within a different framework. Innovation is already seen, above all, merely as a means of giving value to ideas within the market and not as it should be: as a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humanity. However, it has become clear during the debate that these issues are nothing more than a smokescreen for another discussion: that of deepening the disastrous and anti-democratic mechanisms of so-called ‘economic governance’, and of tightening the stranglehold on peoples and countries like, inter alia , Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The areas of energy and innovation are fundamental to growth and employment. Energy is a huge project for European integration, as the internal market was in the past. Europe needs an ambitious vision and a concrete plan in the area of innovation and energy. I hope that Friday’s European Council will be an important milestone in this respect. Much has already been done in the area of the European energy and climate strategy, but we need to go further. We need to stay at the forefront of technology by investing more in research and innovation, building the necessary infrastructure and training more engineers, scientists and technicians. At this critical moment, when we are experiencing an economic crisis, action is urgently needed. Moreover, there is a way of achieving this: by radically changing the way that we produce and use energy in our society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The energy summit taking place this week will serve to highlight the importance of energy solidarity. The most effective ways to ensure the security of energy supplies are a fully common market, a pan-European network, the enforcement of legislation and transparent rules. Unfortunately, some of the leaders of our countries do not understand this. Instead, they prefer to rely on their own national solutions to energy matters, and to bargain with suppliers from third countries. We should therefore take note of the recent calls by European energy companies to liberalise the market and implement EU energy legislation in full. We must be sure when preparing the Infrastructure Package that the European projects in which we want to invest will be selected on the basis of clear and transparent criteria. When creating a pan-European network, we must also place particular emphasis on investment in countries which have very poorly-developed and outdated energy infrastructure, as Mr Barroso said. The market will not take care of this by itself; public measures are needed. We cannot afford a two-speed Europe in the field of energy. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="ro">For the European Union to achieve its proposed targets, the main priority is to implement properly and quickly the Third package for Electricity &amp; Gas markets. Development of the energy infrastructure plays a key role in ensuring the internal energy market’s operation. In this context, I want to stress that particular attention must be focused on the funding for this infrastructure for the timeframe up until 2020. The European Commission must present specific figures on the investment requirements and submit as soon as possible the new instrument for funding the energy infrastructure. In addition to the measures that need to be taken by the European Commission, it is important to strengthen the European Union’s partnerships with international financial institutions with a view to identifying innovative financial instruments.A suitable funding framework also needs to be created, particularly through improving the rules for allocating costs for cross-border projects or technologically advanced projects.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I believe that at its forthcoming summit on 4 February, the European Energy Council should aim to ensure that all energy sources, both traditional and non-traditional, are treated equally. Particular emphasis should be placed on native energy sources, including mineral fuels (coal and shale gas), in order to guarantee energy security for the EU. Use of these sources, with appropriate EU support, will be a decisive factor not only for the security of energy supplies, but also for the EU’s competitiveness and employment levels. At the same time, I would note that by ensuring appropriate investment in the EU’s energy infrastructure, we guarantee the further development of the Member States. I hope that the European Council’s conclusions will be an accurate reflection of the debates that have taken place to date on the 2050 objectives, and that they will not be published before the debate on these objectives, which is due to take place in March 2011.

      <p sl="ro">There are currently 27 energy markets operating in the EU. The lack of interconnection between them is resulting in failure to achieve the EU’s objectives for economic competitiveness and energy security. The lack of a single integrated market means that EU energy policy is unable to provide effective solutions to the problems linked to the fall in Europe’s oil and gas reserves, the rise in crude oil and natural gas prices, the increase in global demand for energy and global warming. I welcome the announcement from Commissioner Oettinger regarding the ambitious deadline proposed by the European Commission, stating that 2015 will be the deadline for completing the internal energy market. I also welcome the intention to interconnect the 27 Member States’ gas and electricity networks and create a suitable infrastructure for the EU to achieve its objectives. I hope that the Commission’s commitment will be understood by European leaders as a call to put Member States’ real long-term interests at the forefront. It will only be possible to initiate the creation and strengthening of the single energy market and common policy in this area by making a firm decision as soon as possible. These are the only factors which can safeguard everyone’s energy security in the medium and long term.</p>

It is an indictment of Europe that the foreign ministers of the Member States in the Council cannot manage to respond to this. They treat the will of Parliament with contempt. The EU must do something. I call on the Council to show responsibility for the basic right of freedom of religion, to swiftly draw up an implementable strategy to protect Christians throughout the world and to establish a separate unit for intercultural and religious matters in the European External Action Service.

      <p sl="de">I have comments to make on two matters: 1. Energy policy: The current path that our energy policy is on will take too long to reach the goal. By means of simplified and accelerated procedures with regard to the development of energy infrastructure, the EU can make important progress in setting its course – although this must under no circumstances be to the detriment of citizens and it must not undermine the Aarhus Convention. Transparency and traceability in the work are necessary prerequisites. It goes without saying that SMEs, with their capacity for innovation, must be involved as equal partners. 2. The financial crisis: The world of the financial markets turns much faster than the Council has reacted up to now. In order to counter the resulting general uncertainty felt by citizens and in the financial world, swift and decisive action is required.</p>

      <p sl="pl">During the forthcoming European Council summit, planned for 4 February, the Heads of State or Government will discuss two topics; the Community’s energy policy and research and development. The key issues regarding the first topic will be energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and security of supply (a matter of particular importance for Poland), whereas the key issues regarding the second topic will be international scientific cooperation and streamlining EU science programmes. I have the impression, however, that the summit, which has been convened under the slogans of energy and innovation, will turn into a conference on current affairs – both those within the European Union (economic policy) and those seemingly further away (the political situation in Tunisia, Egypt and Belarus). It is proving to be the case that the EU must deal with a rapidly rising number of problems, and the problem will not be solved even by more frequent EU summits, as proposed by the EU President, Mr Van Rompuy. The EU must soon find answers to a number of questions, such as whether funding for the European Financial Stability Facility should be increased, how the Member States’ economic policy should be coordinated to ensure that the Facility is not needed in the future, and, finally, how we should react to events with a strong international dimension to ensure that the EU’s voice is heard. It will not only be figures, that is the energy indicators to be achieved before 2020, that will be of key importance when formulating a response, but also the genuine political will of the Member States. Europe consumes one fifth of the world’s energy; how much time will be devoted to energy at Friday’s meeting in Brussels?</p>

      <p sl="pl">The problem of the European Union’s energy policy was raised during the debate on preparations for the European Council summit to be held on 4 February 2011. Energy security is a priority area, and the establishment of a common energy market should be a common European objective towards which we must strive using integrated measures. Alternative energy sources, which are starting to play an ever-greater role in Europe, were a further key point in this debate. The development of modern technologies and green job creation are closely linked to energy policy. Particular attention should be paid to the need to extend the European Research Area. These are ideal examples of measures that fit in with the ideas behind the Europe 2020 strategy, which prioritises innovation and the development of scientific research, as well as green job creation. Europe should integrate its forces in this area too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have all been watching very closely the recent events in Tunisia and more lately in Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="en">The people in both countries have voiced legitimate grievances and aspirations and they expect a proper response not only from within their countries but also from their partners, including the European Union. Their message is clear: their political systems have reached a point of no return, and change must come now.</p>
      <p sl="en">I take this opportunity to express my admiration for their dignity and courage and, in the light of what we are seeing now on our television screens from Egypt in particular, I call for calm and restraint and dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am going to begin by talking about Tunisia. The changes that have taken place have been remarkable and have paved the way for more democratic development of the country. Despite many challenges, we can already see the positive developments in Tunisia, where efforts have been made to meet the demands of the population. The transitional government has taken some important steps, in particular by freeing political prisoners and allowing freedom of expression, as well as prosecuting members of former President Ben Ali’s family for corruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, three independent commissions have been set up and have begun their work: the Commission for inquiry into corruption and misuse of public funds; the Commission for inquiry into abuses during the repression in the course of the latest events; and the High Commission for Political Reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have taken note too of the most recent government reshuffle in response to popular demand. The government has received the support of the main opposition parties and the main trade union – the Tunisian General Labour Union. Peace and stability is important to allow Tunisia to put in place democratic and transparent elections and effect vital political, economic and social changes. The European Union is there to support the country and its people at this difficult moment of transition, and we have responded immediately – not in order to impose our views or ideas, but to offer our help and to work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I spoke last week with the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Ounaies, following his appointment, and we met together today in Brussels. We had a substantial discussion here – the first place that he has visited since taking office – on the best way for the European Union to support the transition and assist the Tunisian people. He confirmed today the request for support from the EU in the preparatory phase of the elections and in the observation of future elections. We are about to dispatch an experts’ mission to Tunisia to assess the electoral legislation and provide legal advice to the transition authorities on it, and last week EEAS managing director Hugues Mingarelli was on the ground in Tunisia discussing people’s needs with them.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for other forms of assistance, we have increased the allocation for cooperation with civil society. This will be combined with a reorientation of our assistance programmes to help the people more directly. Liberal policies alone cannot bring the needed economic and social welfare and wealth distribution for all the Tunisian people. So we are going to review with Tunisia our priorities, to take account of the new situation and adapt our assistance to their social needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today the Minister conveyed to me details of the concerns that they have and the plans that they have, so that we will be able to respond, together with other international partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">I offered concrete support, initially in the areas of electoral support; governance and transition to democracy; support for civil society and NGOs; support for the rule of law and judicial reform; economic governance and the fight against corruption; economic and social development (including support to impoverished areas in the centre and south of Tunisia).</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also ready to consider, with the Member States, mobility-related measures and increased market access. Working-level contacts are well underway on all these issues and we will continue the dialogue. I plan to travel to Tunisia the week after next.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the Tunisian authorities’ request that the assets of Mr Ben Ali and people closely linked to his regime be frozen, we have already taken the initial steps. We accelerated procedures to allow the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday to adopt a decision on restrictive measures, with a view to imposing an assets freeze on persons under inquiry for embezzlement of state funds in Tunisia. The Tunisian authorities have communicated to us a list of persons who should be the object of these measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I indicated, our managing director Hugues Mingarelli travelled to the region last week. He had discussions with the preliminary government and the presidents of each of the three newly established commissions and met with civil-society representatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to welcome too the European Parliament initiative to send a delegation to Tunisia. I believe it is vital that the Tunisian people see the strong support of the EU, and in particular the European Parliament, in what is a critical moment of transition towards democracy. We need to strengthen all possible people-to-people contacts and reach out to civil society, and that includes supporting NGOs, professional associations and student exchanges.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now have an opportunity to strengthen the partnership between Tunisia and the European Union on the basis of an affirmation of democracy and economic and social reform. I hope we can build on the mutual respect and trust among our respective peoples to ensure stability and a democratic and prosperous future for Tunisia. In that context I look forward to the upcoming free and democratic elections and the establishment of the new government. I have agreed with the Tunisian Foreign Minister to resume negotiations on Advanced Status shortly, with a view to their conclusion once a new democratically elected government is in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Foreign Minister described the atmosphere as an atmosphere of reconciliation. I hope that we will be able to work with Tunisia to move that atmosphere forward towards a new, freer democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will now address the situation in Egypt. Just over one week ago we witnessed the start of an extraordinary movement there. Anti-government protests – clearly inspired by the events in Tunisia and beyond, and organised mainly through social media and word of mouth – have, I think, taken the whole world by surprise.</p>
      <p sl="en">The great strength of this popular uprising is that it is happening across Egypt. Hundreds of thousands of people, young and old, men and women, are taking to the streets, demanding their legitimate political and socio-economic rights. The protests have spread from Cairo to Alexandria and Suez and further across Egypt and the crowds have continued to grow in size and diversity, with protestors united in their demands for regime change and for the observance of fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The initially relatively peaceful protests have become increasingly violent, with the police firing teargas and rubber bullets and using water cannons. We are concerned that live ammunition may also have been used. Like all the honourable Members here, I deplore the considerable loss of life during the demonstrations and my thoughts go out to those who have lost their loved ones. The large number of injured and arrested is also a cause of great concern, and all parties have to show restraint and stop the violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have prepared for the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday with our conclusions calling upon the Egyptian authorities to immediately release all peaceful demonstrators who have been detained. Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are fundamental human rights for everybody, which the state has a duty to protect. The imposed restrictions on media, including the Internet, are unacceptable and I urge the Egyptian authorities to restore all communication networks without delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through nationwide demonstrations, the Egyptian people are expressing their wish to see change. Hundreds of thousands have gathered in each rally across the country. It is of the utmost importance that these voices are listened to, now, and that the situation is addressed through urgent, concrete and decisive measures. The time has come for orderly transition and a peaceful and far-reaching transformation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The authorities must seek, and take seriously, an open dialogue with the political forces. It is important that civil society plays a crucial role in that dialogue. The Egyptian authorities must move forward quickly through a broad-based government leading to a genuine process of substantial democratic reform and paving the way for free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will offer our full support to an Egypt that strives for transformation to be more democratic and more pluralist. We have a shared interest in peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean and Middle East region.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we must do now is adapt and reinforce the means at our disposal to support the necessary political, economic and social reforms. Our cooperation already has democracy, human rights and the rule of law as constituent elements and we have to refocus and strengthen that work.</p>
      <p sl="en">For me, politics is about changing things: about helping people shape their own lives. Across the Arab world, we are seeing lots of potentially positive change, driven by the demands of people.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the European Union, our offer to the region and to the people is solidarity and support to put the reforms in place. We are a union of democracies – we have a democratic calling, so we will back this process of change with creativity and with determination.</p>

      <p sl="es">It is my opinion that we should not be looking for culprits in this House as this crisis has caught the European Union on the wrong foot, however I feel that we ought to draw some conclusions on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the European Union needs to be more visible, it needs to speak with a unified voice and to avoid any cacophony; it is for this reason that we have created the European External Action Service and the figure of the High Representative.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, we need to draw on the lessons offered to us by complacent policies with the enemies of freedom, from Belarus to Cuba and with the Mediterranean countries in between. We need to ask ourselves if there really is more stability, more prosperity and more democracy as the Barcelona Process intended.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, Mr President, I feel that we need to distinguish between what the European Union needs to do in the medium term and what it needs to do in the short term. In the short term – I think that Baroness Ashton has drawn up a road map – the European Union needs to offer resolute support to these transition processes so as not to frustrate these friendly countries’ hopes for freedom. It is also our duty, Mr President, to warn them of the risks involved in these processes, so they are not hijacked by the enemies of free societies.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the medium term, Mr President, it is important that the European Union reflects deeply on a strategic approach to reforming our neighbourhood policy as we also requested of Mr Füle yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of this must be done, Mr President, whilst bearing in mind that often it is more difficult to maintain the balance of freedom than to shake off the yoke of tyranny.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the current events in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries in the region, must remind us that stability without freedom is, if not a mere illusion, at least an unsustainable reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also remember that a revolution or a social upheaval is a guarantee of change, but it is not a guarantee of change for the better. I hope that we will find the inspiration to assist this process in order to make it a process which brings change for the better and not for the worse.</p>
      <p sl="en">Deep analysis is needed of the situation in both Tunisia and Egypt (and not only there), since we have to understand whether we did the right things in the past with a view to avoiding these crises. What steps should we take in the future in order to anticipate or avoid similar crises? And lastly, what could we do in order to make sure that the present crisis will move things towards freedom for the peoples concerned and stability for the region, while avoiding any shift towards more, or another type of, instability and another type of totalitarianism or oppression.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to adopt a preventive and proactive attitude in this respect, and that requires strategy. Certainly our messages were correct in terms of balancing the key word ‘reform’ with the key words ‘order’ or ‘stability’. But the devil is, precisely, in the detail, and indeed it is the feeling of many of us that we have not yet addressed the details, and that we have not shown enough vision or enough strength in addressing the challenges. Another important factor is our capacity to talk to all valid actors, including the Islamic forces, in such a way as to be able to integrate all of them into a positive process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We hope that the Commission and the Council will be able to shape such a strategy in the future and we would be happy if they could tell us more about that.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I believe that the events taking place at the moment in Tunisia, and especially over the last few hours in Egypt, are both historic and very tragic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are now hearing that hundreds and hundreds of people have been injured in the last few hours. I am making this point above all because I see a similarity between what is happening at the moment in the Middle East, in North Africa, and what happened in Europe in 1989. That is precisely why I am surprised, astonished and disappointed at the way that Europe is currently making exactly the same mistakes as it made in 1989, and I wish to make that clear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is incredible, Mr President, that we, the so-called democratic continent, have still not managed to offer our unreserved support to the masses on the streets – masses who are calling for nothing other than our support.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I have not heard Baroness Ashton offer our support yet, either yesterday or today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why, Baroness Ashton, has Europe reacted so feebly? In point of fact, we have hardly reacted at all. You reacted, and then Germany, France and the United Kingdom also issued a communication without consulting each other, as if Europe did not exist. I have to say that the only satisfactory European speech came from outside the Union, namely from the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan, who told Mr Mubarak that he should listen to the demands of his people and that he should therefore step down. That was the only decent response to be heard at European level.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the speech that you are making today is very important for the people on the streets, who may even be fighting for their lives. I believe that Europe has made two mistakes in recent days.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, we do not realise just what an historic moment this is, and, secondly, and much more importantly, we have misjudged the situation. We are afraid – and that is why there is this misjudged communication – that an Islamist regime will come to power after the elections. Well, let me tell you that I am not afraid. I have confidence in the people of Tunisia and in the people of Egypt.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">They are the ones who want democracy, and the fact that the Copts and the Muslims are now marching shoulder to shoulder is proof enough of what they want, which is a truly open democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall give you a second example to show why we should not be afraid to call for open democracy in these countries. You all know about Mohammed Bouazizi, the man who in fact sparked off the revolution in Tunisia by his self-immolation. Well, Baroness Ashton, on Mr Bouazizi’s coffin there was no green flag of Islam. There was the red flag of Tunisia, and so these are not Islamist revolutions that we are seeing at present. Quite the contrary, they are revolutions for freedom.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, now that thousands of people have been gathering in Cairo for almost a week, and now that there are demonstrations in Jordan, Yemen, Syria and Algeria, I call on you, Baroness Ashton, to change the European Union’s position. I would like you to speak on our behalf and say clearly today, in this House, that the European Union is 100% behind the people of Egypt and their demands. We want President Mubarak to finally listen to his people and, by stepping down, free his country so that it may enjoy democracy and freedom today. That is the message I would like to hear in the response that you are about to make.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you are appealing for calm. However, call a spade a spade! It is Mr Mubarak’s troops which have brought terror to the square, today, in Egypt, not the demonstrators! So, do not appeal for everyone to be calm. Ask Mr Mubarak to stop attacking the demonstrators, because he is doing that so that he can then say: ‘I am going to restore order amid this chaos’. That is the trap he is setting for us, and all we can do is say to both sides, ‘Calm down!’ No, emphatically not. We must tell Mr Mubarak to calm down, and the best way to calm things down is for him to clear off, to get out. Then there will be calm in Cairo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Did you see that the people who came with knives were Mr Mubarak’s policemen? It was poor people, brought by bus this morning from the depths of Egypt, who caused the trouble. This must be said, Baroness Ashton, and we must not turn a blind eye. There is something that amazes me about you: today you understand everything about what happened, about what was going on in Tunisia three weeks ago. However, when, three weeks ago, we in the European Parliament took the step of calling on you to halt the negotiations on the upgrading of Tunisia because of the dictatorship, you told us that that was not possible. Now, today, it is possible. You are a last-minute resistance fighter. That makes everything clear. I therefore ask one thing of you, Baroness Ashton: tell us where, in the case of Tunisia, Europe has invested its money. Tell us which firms have received European money; tell us which of Mr Ben Ali and his wife’s companies were supported by European money. You can tell us. This Parliament has the right to know.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, Baroness Ashton, since you say that you are now going to support the people of Tunisia, I would ask you to ensure one thing: that there is equality of opportunity in the democratic process during the transition. If there are new elections – as you know, the Tunisian Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD) has money but the opposition parties, which have been prohibited for years, do not – the European Union must play its part in supporting democratic fairness and equality. In the case of Egypt, Baroness Ashton, one thing is clear today: if we do not manage to support the Egyptians in the liberation process, the peoples of the Middle East, the Arab peoples will once again turn their backs on us, at a time when we have an extraordinary situation on our hands, a situation that you also failed to mention, Mr Verhofstadt: in Gaza, a demonstration has been held to support the Egyptians, and Hamas has prohibited that demonstration. That is proof that the wind of freedom is now blowing against the theocracies in the Middle East and in the Arab countries, too, and that it is our job to help them. We have spent years whining, when the only choice was between dictatorships and theocracies. Well, Inshallah! There is a third possibility, which is freedom and the fight for freedom against dictatorships and theocracies, and it is our role as Europeans to support those leading this fight.</p>

      <p sl="fr">That is exactly the point I wished to make to you: if we fail to support those who are fighting for freedom, then they will end up in an impasse and the other side will win. That is precisely the lesson we learnt from Iran, Mrs Tzavela. The lesson we learnt from Iran was summed up by Mr Gorbachev: ‘History will punish those who arrive too late.’</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, France, of course, nurtured the Ayatollah Khomeini and flew him back to Tehran.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, on another issue, Egypt has been a republic since 1956 but Mubarak is only the country’s third President. In Tunisia, Ben Ali was only the second leader since independence 53 years ago. When the political landscape offers such little hope of change, inevitably frustrations boil over – as we now see with the hurricane of change blowing across the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group, the ECR Group, calls for a genuinely democratic and peaceful transition in Egypt. Today we see a worrying trend towards violence. It is hard to see how Mubarak can credibly play a role in that transition other than by stepping down.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tunisia also remains in ferment, and the longer that lasts the greater the danger that Islamists will seize the political initiative. Tunisia may have been authoritarian and corrupt, but it was profoundly secular and pro-Western; we must remember that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed this is also a danger in Egypt, where the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood is seeking to fill the political vacuum as we speak. The radicalisation of Egyptian politics would be a disaster for that country and for neighbouring Israel. But it could also have grave implications for the operation of the Suez Canal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s diplomatic efforts in Tunisia and Egypt must be focused entirely on ensuring stability and order, and resisting those who would wish to spread violence and fear as we see today. To build a liberal democracy in these countries with no such traditions, the EU, the USA and our political think-tanks in Europe must now place significant resources behind moderate democratic politicians and new parties who must be committed to democratic pluralism and free and fair elections and, unlike the Muslim Brotherhood, be prepared to relinquish power if defeated at the ballot box. This is a huge challenge and of course we may now be witnessing an historic ‘fall of the Berlin Wall moment’ in the Muslim world.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are already good democratic role models in Muslim-majority countries, such as Indonesia, Turkey and Bangladesh, for Egypt and Tunisia to emulate. Hopefully, in future the choice in the Muslim world will not be between secular tyranny and Islamist theocracies but instead enduring democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This is a popular revolt because the people are subjected to abject poverty. Hence the leaders that we have supported, albeit for the sake of ensuring a certain amount of stability and averting the danger of Islamism, exercise a reign of terror and keep the people in poverty.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I did not particularly wish to revisit the past, but I am hearing some surprising speeches. I think that in recent times, for months now, we were practically the only ones, along with a few MEPs from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to call for a debate on the situation in Tunisia. As Mr Cohn-Bendit rightly said, there are indeed many last-minute resistance fighters. We could say a lot about the past, but we said it in our resolution and we think that we should focus first and foremost on the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, we must avoid interfering in any way in the internal affairs of these countries. It is not up to us, as Europeans, to say what the composition of these countries’ governments should be. The Tunisian people acted alone to free itself from a dictatorial regime. We must allow it to express itself and support it on the road to democracy. Anyone following the situation in Tunisia knows that the past is not yet dead and buried and that there are people pulling strings and plotting behind the scenes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, the violence happening in Egypt also shows that things are difficult. So, yes, do strongly condemn all the violence, and do not just call for it to be scaled down, as you did in the case of Tunisia. Police violence is always unacceptable: it is as unacceptable today as it was in the past; it is as unacceptable in Tunisia and Egypt as it is elsewhere. Let us ask the Tunisian authorities and the Tunisian people what they expect without imposing anything on them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You reviewed your discussions with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but you added, without seemingly having been asked, that you wanted to increase market access in Tunisia. That is rather inappropriate, in my view, as there has been no shortage of help from the European Union in that area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everybody appears to be waking up today to the corruption of Mr Ben Ali’s regime. Yes, economic liberalisation in Tunisia has benefited the Ben Ali and Trabelsi families thanks to the European Union’s help. Yes, the European Union must be firm with regard to all human rights violations. The European Union has lost a great deal of credibility in these countries. Yes, finally, we must support the democrats and condemn all dictatorships.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the old order is changing in the Maghreb and this crisis raises a multitude of problems that will not be easy to solve.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are risks as well as hopes. It is possible that secular authoritarian regimes could be replaced by aggressive, destabilising Islamic fundamentalist theocracies. We should remember what happened in Iran: it is hard for democratic development to go hand-in-hand with revolution. There are certainly lessons to be learnt from Iran.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another danger is that the economic crisis in the area is likely to worsen, resulting in even greater youth unemployment and large influxes of migrants that Europe can no longer cope with.</p>
      <p sl="it">These events are a sign that our Euro-Mediterranean policy is inadequate and show that the cooperation policy implemented so far is not up to the task of creating the conditions for development and democracy. What has happened is not due solely to the economic crisis, even though it has been severe, but to the lack of social stability, in other words the lack of vehicles to represent the people’s interests, such as trade unions, a free press, political pluralism, a voluntary sector, the rule of law and equal opportunities for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="it">Supporting the countries of this region in their journey should be at the heart of Europe’s policy, alongside economic and trade assistance. This is the way to create true stability: not the stability provided by authoritarian regimes, but stability founded on social consensus, participation and democratic institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">People expect change and they expect aid without strings. I am so glad that Mr Cohn-Bendit has followed up the point I made in the delegation committee this morning about exactly what has happened to the EU money over all these years. The EAS representative there said that it was spent on reforms. What reforms? If there were adequate reforms, the people would not have revolted in the way they did.

In all our involvement with them we have always advanced the principles of pluralistic democracy, freedom of the media, of expression and of assembly, respect for human rights, an independent judiciary, and good governance. But we have always maintained that these principles should be realised from within, not imposed from outside.</p>
      <p sl="en">The people of Tunisia succeeded, from within, in defying repression, a police state and torture, and in winning freedom and democracy. The Tunisian authorities must respect the will of the people and proceed without delay to a process of democratisation, with accountability in cases of corruption or repression by the cronies of Ben Ali.</p>
      <p sl="en">For similar reasons the people of Egypt have defied killings, arrests, tear gas and bullets and have demanded bread and freedom, dignity and emancipation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Beware: democracy does not mean elections. It means much, much more than this. We unequivocally support the people of Egypt and call on their current leaders to listen to the wisdom of their people and not to become an obstacle in responding to their aspirations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Here as I speak, the museum in Cairo is in flames, fighting is breaking out in the streets, and I believe that, in the case of Egypt at least, we have not been clear enough. President Mubarak has to leave, that has to be made clear. President Mubarak, as he is today – and I respect his long struggle – is incapable of leading the political transition; it is madness to ask that of him and to let the Mubarak clan square up to the ElBaradei clan today on the streets of Cairo. We must shoulder our responsibilities in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to say to you that, over the last few days and nights, I have not stopped thinking about the mistake we made. We made a spectacular mistake: we supported corrupt regimes in the name of stability, with no thought for social justice or the peoples’ aspirations for freedom.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">This is a mistake that we must rectify, and now is the time to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second mistake, I am afraid to say, ladies and gentlemen, is that we have failed to understand political Islam. I did not say ‘we have failed to accept political Islam’! There is a difference between terrorists, fundamentalists, and some Muslim brothers. It is up to us to see the difference, to enter into dialogue, to set aside those who we do not want, but today we have paved the way for these fundamentalists. We have paved the way for certain terrorists!</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time to review these positions and, lastly, we must hold on to the past achievements of these countries, of Tunisia, Egypt and so on. I am talking here about the countries’ secular structures and about women’s rights, of which there were many in these countries, in secular structures and constitutions unrelated to Sharia law. Democracies can be built with extremely diverse parties. Let us not throw the baby out with the bath water.

      <p sl="en">Egypt is a country where for 30 or so years a dictator, in the person of Mubarak, has assumed absolute power in a particularly brutal, tyrannous and arbitrary rule and, while we all recognise the extraordinary evolution on the streets of Egypt, we also recognise in Mubarak’s reaction somebody who feels he has got support, not only in Egypt but elsewhere.</p>

We are only capable of projecting moral power, so when Baroness Ashton spoke, very softly, at the beginning of this debate, she unfortunately did not carry a big stick as well.

Various scenarios are possible, ranging from a peaceful takeover of power by the pro-democratic forces to economic chaos and the outbreak of armed conflict, and even the use of nuclear weapons cannot be ruled out.</p>

We must not forget the resolution adopted recently by our House on the persecution of Christians, in which Egypt was also mentioned. We should consider taking more tangible measures, and send an observation mission to Egypt.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the European Union needs to revise its neighbourhood policy, as it is clear that we have given the impression of being more concerned with reaching free trade agreements than with the development of peoples and their human rights. The problem, Baroness Ashton, is not the European Union’s position today on the Ben Ali or Mubarak regimes, but the position that the European Union took the day before yesterday, which did not show the slightest support for the changes that the people have demanded on the streets.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the problem that the European Union has to resolve: that we are not showing any support for the changes that the people are demanding, not only in Tunisia, but in Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen; a huge number of people that can no longer take autocracy or a crisis that affects the weakest. This is the revision that the European Union has to make; it has to be at the forefront of the circumstances through changing the direction of its neighbourhood policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is not surprising that the exciting political developments in Tunisia and Egypt are being closely watched in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Both the Iranian Government and the opposition are supporting the voices on the streets. Interestingly enough, both are claiming the credit for this Arab popular uprising. The Iranian regime is hailing the arrival of the revolutionary wave which originated in its own country in 1979 and which they believe is now spreading across the Arab world, while the Iranian opposition considers itself the instigator of the mass popular protests in Tunis and Cairo.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Whilst the pragmatic Arab camp in the Middle East is nearing imminent collapse, the Iranian leadership has more cause for optimism than the opposition. The European Union should not turn a blind eye to this threat. A radicalisation of the Arab world is definitely incompatible with a dignified life, which is what the Tunisian and Egyptian protesters justifiably say that they long for. The Islamic Republic of Iran should by no means be seen as a model, but as a cautionary tale.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, what is happening now in countries like Tunisia and Egypt is an immensely important development. People are rising up against dictatorial despots and that is a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The big question, of course, is what is going to follow in the wake of these events. There is something of a paradox when it comes to democratisation in the Islamic world, where more democracy often leads to more Islamism, which in turn leads to less democracy. Obviously, we from Europe should support the democratic process. However, that support should be given to genuine democratic forces and we should never intentionally assist an organisation such as the Muslim Brotherhood in establishing a theocratic dictatorship in Egypt by giving it the EU’s support. Otherwise, we will end up with situations such as that which we are now witnessing in Iran playing out across the whole region.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let us therefore be prudent in our choice of partners. After all, Ben Ali and his party were still members of the Socialist Internationale until a few weeks ago. Now that the wind has turned, though, he has been expelled from it overnight. Well, ladies and gentlemen, be prudent in the future, be careful in your choice of partners and do not make things easy for the Islamists.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, our response to the events in the Arab world must be based on our concept of humanity. Every human being, whether Muslim, Jew, Christian or of no particular faith, has the same value and the same right to live in dignity. If this is the case, then it also means that the people in the Arab countries have the right to live in freedom, in a democracy and with a way of life that respects human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, therefore, it is our duty, our responsibility and an important task for the future for us to say to the people of the Arab world, who are peacefully standing up for freedom and democracy, that we are standing in solidarity at their side. We express our solidarity with the peaceful Muslims in the Arab world.</p>

      <p sl="de">We made the mistake once before of closing our eyes in relation to totalitarian Communism because we said that we need stability. We must not make this mistake again today, because stability also involves freedom and democracy, and that is something we should support.</p>
      <p sl="de">If what we are hearing at this time is true – I did not previously know that shots were being fired in Cairo, and previously the army was also being restrained in both Tunisia and Egypt – that the army is moving in with violence, then this can only last for a short time. In Europe, we had the uprisings in East Germany in 1953, in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and then came Solidarność.</p>
      <p sl="de">Freedom will prevail in the end, and therefore to all those who are using violence today we must say: stop shooting and give the people freedom by means of free elections. We ought to put all our efforts into supporting this in word and deed, including in this House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, some people say that you cannot learn from history. However, we should nevertheless try to do so. With regard to the heckling concerning Iran – and Mr Cohn-Bendit has already responded to that – I would like to mention once again what happened in Iran at that time. We supported a dirty regime. We more or less tolerated the secret police, who at that time were working against people and torturing people. The United States, together with the United Kingdom, overthrew Mohammad Mossadegh, who wanted a peaceful revolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have made some progress in this regard now, but we have still not come far enough. I believe that we need to say very clearly – and in this regard I agree with my fellow Member who has already mentioned this – that we need to be on the side of the people who started and stepped up this revolution – and this was not the Islamists. Let us be pleased about the great opportunity presented by the fact that the revolution was not started by the Islamists but by the people on the street, by ordinary citizens, who were dissatisfied with social injustice, the economic situation and the lack of democracy. That is what happened here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, let us look at ourselves with a self-critical eye because part of our neighbourhood strategy has collapsed as a result of this. Furthermore, part of our neighbourhood strategy was based on there being stability. We need peace in the Middle East. We expected peace in the Middle East to rest with the dictatorships and the dictators and that is not possible, nor is it acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">We therefore need to speak and express our opinion clearly. Peace in the Middle East will be lasting only if it is based on democracy and not on dictatorships. Therefore, Baroness Ashton, we must express our opinion loud and clear. I know that you are known for your gentle approach, but in this regard I agree with my fellow Members that we need to be loud and clear. You need to speak so loudly that you drown out many of the voices of our foreign ministers, sometimes perhaps even so loud that we do not hear the voice of Hillary Clinton, but the voice of Catherine Ashton. That is what this Parliament expects. Take this also as proof of our confidence in you that we expect you to be very clear in what you say.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The events in Tunisia, which was regarded as a haven of stability and economic security, are strikingly similar to those which initiated the downfall of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe. They are providing the spark which heralds the collapse of the Arab pseudo model of stability and will trigger democratic changes in the region.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The demands are clear and the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples would not agree to any half measures. Many of the prerequisites for the transition to democracy are already gaining ground, such as an active, well-organised civil society, a free press, respected opposition figures and existing political parties. However, we need to revise completely our current foreign policy, Baroness Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The European Union should make a strategic choice, striking a balance between its political and economic interests and the democratic values which unite us. Europe must demonstrate that it stands squarely behind democracy and not merely supports stability in the region.

If there were such a dramatic political change, Europe, as well as America, would lose a moderate Arabic ally and the Egypt peace treaty would be endangered.

We are with the people of Egypt protesting for their rights to prosperity, health and education. That is why Parliament should continue to provide its unanimous support. I should mention that we must keep the Palestinians in mind during this process, so that the Palestinian people do not become the victims.

      <p sl="it">From this point of view, it is vital for Europe to be on guard so that we do not get into a situation where there are hostile countries in North Africa which, we must remember, has many trade links with Europe.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, I may have been hard on you in the past, but I have to admit that this business must be making your life very complicated, so I hope that what I have to say may be able to help.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first thing I want to state very clearly is that the role of States is to protect their citizens, not to run their lives. When a government run people’s lives instead of protecting them, it stops being a government and becomes a regime. This is what happened in Tunisia and in Egypt, because political situations that began with the profound idealism of winning independence had been regimes for many years. Our task is to defend the liberty and democracy in the hearts of those who are today defending it in the streets.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second subject I want to mention concerns us, the European Union. We need to admit that we do not have a political strategy for the Euro-Mediterranean region, which means admitting that the Barcelona Process and the Union for the Mediterranean have failed. It is a pretence: these are just political games that serve no purpose and have achieved nothing. We need to act decisively on this. We need to begin to develop this strategy: we need to plan it and we need to carry it through, as we did for Eastern Europe and as we did for the Balkans, although they had to be forced into it.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, I get the impression that you are not yet sufficiently aware of what is going on in the Mediterranean region. I have to say that the slowness of the EU institutions in addressing the Mediterranean question can only be explained by a lack of awareness of the situation and an inability to sense the changes that are afoot.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are coming to the end of a political and historical era in which Europe’s policy towards the South has been muddled and counterproductive. The economic crisis, difficulties faced in migrating and the lack of changeover among the ruling classes have created an explosive combination that is affecting Tunisia and Egypt now, but is likely to spread to other countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">To address some of my fellow Members also, I would say that we will not get away with thinking that all we need to do is to simply give our support to the demonstrations that are currently taking place. Europe needs to show greater political maturity. To do this, we need to retune Europe’s political antennae. Europe’s foreign policy needs to come out of its semi-secretive mode and take a leading role on the international stage in supporting the democratic transition processes currently underway.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, we need clear policies in a number of areas: a new partnership and neighbourhood policy, and a new security policy for the Mediterranean region; greater willingness from the whole of Europe to address the Mediterranean issue; and a policy of joint action so that Europe will be acting in the region alongside other players, such as the United States and Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need a major change of course and this calls for an act of considerable humility on the Commission’s part in reopening the debate on foreign policy towards the Mediterranean and taking a fresh look at the Union for the Mediterranean, whilst at the same time ensuring that Europe has a role within it. This is crucial for Europe, and we need to be fully aware of this.</p>

We should approach this as an incredible opportunity and an opportunity to help this region evolve, after years of political and economic stagnation, into a true democracy, with opportunities for all. Here, I am thinking, above all, of the millions of young people who are hungry for more freedom and the opportunity to develop. The impact of this cannot be underestimated. Some are speaking of a 1989 moment for the Arab world, but whether or not that is the case remains to be seen.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what has already been said by my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). However, I would like to stress the fact that the recent events in the Mediterranean have astounded us all, because until a few weeks ago they were completely unforeseen.</p>
      <p sl="it">The External Action Service led by Baroness Ashton seems to have been caught by surprise and in my opinion is now demonstrating a poor response capacity. Right now, I am wondering if it is worthwhile spending so much money on a service organised the way it is today. Once again, we are seeing the total lack of a European presence on the Euro-Mediterranean scene.</p>
      <p sl="it">We uphold the right of all peoples to decide on their own government and their own ruling class through free, democratic elections, not through actions imposed by brute force and extremism. As has been said, it is time that stability and democracy went hand-in-hand. Therefore, we are now using all legitimate means to strengthen democracy and political pluralism, with respect for the rule of law, human rights and citizens’ safety.</p>
      <p sl="it">The whole world, and we Europeans most of all, need a Mediterranean that is at peace. The European Union must change its own policy and strive without further delay to provide adequate aid and collaboration to help bring about the necessary socioeconomic development in all Mediterranean countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Tunisian democrats have given us an exemplary lesson in maturity in recent times. Therefore, in these moments of tension that we are living and in light of the massacre that is occurring in Egypt, we would like a unified voice in the European Union so that we can truly put a stop to this massacre and so that these winds of freedom can truly bring about a profound change towards democracy in Egypt too.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the case of Tunisia, however, we still have time. Here in Parliament, tomorrow we vote on a resolution – there is going to be a delegation in the country – and our support, our democratic guarantee is also very important in these moments, particularly in Tunisia, then in Egypt and all those countries that are demanding more freedom.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is still a great deal that we can do, as the costs of an economic collapse caused by a break-up and revolution of this nature must be kept to a minimum. There are too many enemies that want to turn Tunisia into a model that is totally different from the one we want. Tunisia has turned into a model and what we are seeing is, in reality, the end of a post-colonial era and the start of true independence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the economic situation of Tunisia is an opportunity – aside from the aid that Mrs Ashton has mentioned – for the Central European Bank to take a position so as not to miss an experience that could be vital for the future of the Mediterranean. It is essential that this decision is taken with a degree of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, right now, as we stand here, citizens in Egypt are being trapped and attacked in Tahrir Square and the army and the police are reportedly attacking instead of protecting. In their peaceful protests Egyptians of diverse backgrounds ask for respect for human rights and democracy, political reform and good governance, and socio-economic development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Perhaps these demands sound familiar to you as they are precisely the goals of EU programmes in the Middle East, and in Egypt specifically. The Commission alone has spent a total of almost EUR 3 billion on this in the past 15 years. As the people’s demands are already in line with our policy objectives, why is it so difficult to make a strong EU statement quickly?</p>
      <p sl="en">The need for a strong, proactive Europe is more urgent than ever. As the sun of freedom and democracy rises over the Middle East, clouds of division are hampering European unity and the ability to take responsibility. I urge you to look at what is happening as we speak and to act in unequivocal support of the people. Their rights and the EU’s credibility are tied.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another phenomenon consistently present in the relations between people and dictatorships is communication and information technologies. The Tunisian Government ranked among the most severe users of censorship, surveillance and filter technologies to repress citizens. European companies, such as Vodafone and French Telecom, have had a strong presence in Egypt and in killing the connections by flipping the switch and shutting Egypt down. I would like to see an inquiry into the role that European companies played in the violations of human rights by hampering free expression, a free press and access to information and creating an environment in which human rights violations could go undocumented.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mrs Ashton, in my opinion the European Union made several mistakes in its past relations with Tunisia and Egypt. We made a mistake as far as Tunisia is concerned when we failed to speak up after Ben Ali won the presidential elections in 2009. I should add, by way of a reminder, that he won 90% of votes, but that the elections were neither free nor democratic. The same was true when the Penal Code was amended in Tunisia, putting an end to the activities of non-governmental and human rights organisations. We cannot afford such a policy of passivity and inactivity when it comes to the measures to be taken by Europe in the region of North Africa today. It will be very hard to return stability to the region if we do not play an active role and demonstrate our determination to achieve this goal. Governments which respect human rights, freedom of speech and the media will only return to power in North Africa if we take an active and determined approach to events in these countries.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago we were debating in this House the European Union’s relations with Tunisia, and I said at the time that the social achievements of which the Tunisians were so proud should be accompanied by political progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, we have seen over recent weeks that there is political progress at least in the sense that the incipient revolt is the extremely clear and obvious expression of a desire for freedom. The situation in Egypt is similar, even though things are moving fast. We do not know what the outcome will be, and in the future there will undoubtedly be other places which will demonstrate this desire for freedom just as clearly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, as we have seen tonight, some of us fear that this wind of change will not necessarily lead to secularism or to the continuation of a secular state, to moderation or to stability. I believe that we must be aware of the fact that it is indeed possible that, in the coming weeks and years, this region will not experience political regimes that are both stable and inspired by freedom and moderation. That is entirely possible, and I believe that we must be prepared for that eventuality too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore encourage Baroness Ashton to perhaps steer the Union’s strategy back on the course plotted by the Commission in 2005 in its report for the Barcelona summit.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, until now I had suspected that peoples were always ahead of their political elites. Today I am quite sure of this. May I first of all pay tribute to the courage and determination of the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples. They have reminded us that the values that we stand for in the world – human rights and democracy – are not values exclusive to the West, as some proclaim, but rather are universal values shared by all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe, in my view, can no longer continue to make mistakes in this part of the world, shilly-shallying as it does from wrong analyses to misguided projects. These peoples are expecting a response from us that is equal to their courage and aspirations. They are not asking for charity but they are certainly asking for solidarity, and even more so for responsibility. In these uncertain times, nobody wants chaos, but nobody should have to accept the status quo any longer, either.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must support the hope created by the events in Tunisia and Egypt in order to help affirm and establish democracies that will benefit these countries and their populations, but which will also benefit us, and I believe that you have expressed this forcefully, Baroness Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude by quoting what a poet once said: ‘The world sleeps from a lack of imprudence.’ These peoples, quite rightly, have been imprudent in calling for their freedom, but I hope above all that they will have awakened our consciences.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would ask you to be more courageous. Go to Cairo before the Council of Foreign Ministers. Speak with the government representatives and with the opposition there. Come back to Brussels and tell your colleagues what you have seen and heard. Set the agenda and do not listen to 27 different opinions, with which it is then very difficult to actually do anything.</p>
      <p sl="de">When Mr Mingarelli goes to Tunisia – something that I view very positively – inform us so that we are aware and so that the public is aware that Europe has a presence there. I first found out that the American was there and only then did I hear that Mr Mingarelli was also there. You are the foreign minister for Europe and I would earnestly advise you, on the one hand, to be our foreign minister. On the other hand, as foreign minister for Europe, you must not jump through every hoop that people put in front of you.</p>
      <p sl="de">Comparisons have been made here today with 1989, and I think that is right. I believe that Tahrir Square in Cairo in 2011 is equivalent to Alexanderplatz in Berlin in 1989. A revolution is taking place there. However, if we recall the revolution of 1989 for a moment we will remember that we had the same dilemma then. We wanted freedom, stability and democracy, and we overlook the fact that this process, the transition from a stable dictatorship to a democracy, is rarely peaceful, orderly and stable. From this point of view, diplomacy, organisation and caution also have their place.</p>
      <p sl="de">That should not distract us from the fact that we are extremely pleased about this revolution. It is a revolution against the dictatorship and for freedom. I do believe that Europe can dictate the setup in these countries. However, our joy needs to be apparent, but one thing is also clear, and that is that, even with limited influence, it will certainly not be possible to build a state with Mr Mubarek. With the violence today in Tahrir Square, the last vestige of legitimacy for this ruler in Egypt has been lost.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The grass-roots changes in Tunisia, caused by public support for Ben Ali running out, may mean the chance of a better future for this country. In contrast, a certain amount of caution must be employed when assessing the situation in Egypt. In spite of his feudal rule, Hosni Mubarak acted as a guarantor of stability in Egypt. If he is overthrown now, given that the lack of suitable conditions to date has meant that no democratic opposition has formed – and this is a point I would like to stress – it would appear that Egypt may be pushed into the arms of extreme political groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. The international consequences of such a turn of events should be considered. A possible alliance with Hamas, a hard-line policy towards Israel, intensified persecution of Christians and an exacerbation of the situation in the region – are these possibilities better than stability under Mubarak? While recognising his fundamental flaws, as well as the legitimacy of the protests against what has been happening under his regime, we should give thought as to what the optimum solution would be in this situation, and what approach should be taken by the European Union.</p>

These countries are right on our doorstep and we have numerous strong ties of friendship with them.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the last decade, the European Union has been unable to persuade their authorities to undertake the necessary reforms. In the last parliamentary term I myself stressed that stability could not continue to be used to justify a lack of change, but rather that these countries needed profound political, economic and social reforms. Now change and reform are being demanded by the people on the streets.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that the Council finally paid attention to these events on Monday and has taken a position. I too have the impression that the transition process in Tunisia is headed in the right direction.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, what needs to be done now has already been said many times – in this regard there is broad consensus. Our resolution is clear with regard to Tunisia, but with regard to Egypt we will have to expand it as necessary by means of oral amendments.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think there are grounds for self-criticism. Our executives in Brussels and in the Member States held on to the status quo for too long. If we had taken our own principles seriously in day-to-day politics in relation to the universal nature of human rights and democracy, we would have had to speak clearly to Tunisia and Egypt about their blatant shortcomings. We knew that the action taken against Islamists and fundamentalists was not aimed solely at these groups, but also at any criticism of the relevant government policy. It is still not too late. The call for democracy and human rights is neither interference in internal affairs nor can it be denounced as something that has contributed to destabilising the situation. No dictatorship, no authoritarian regime is stable in itself. With our current policy we have therefore simply gained time, but not stability.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tunisia and Egypt serve as examples for others. Everyone knows of others in the region. Many people are afraid to mention them by name. To my mind, Saudi Arabia is a possible candidate, for example. This situation requires political leadership by the High Representative. However, the 27 do not have differing interests. If your judgment is right, do not wait until the last diplomatic sceptic has re-briefed his foreign minister. What Senator John Kerry said the day before yesterday and Barack Obama said this evening with regard to Egypt should also have come from you. Emancipate yourself in the interests of the Union so that the EU itself, and no one else, will formulate its policies for the future in its own neighbourhood.

We have no guarantee that the revolt in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries in the area will not become a pretext for the seizure of power by Islamic extremists, as happened in Iran. The moment of truth is also approaching for the European institutions. The European Union has every opportunity finally to play the role for which it was created. It should provide effective support for the pro-pluralist political powers. It should also revise the neighbourhood policy, since it is very obvious that the way in which it has been conducted to date has resulted in it being exploited to hold up the governments of corrupt rulers. A substantial portion of the money earmarked for the development of neighbouring areas and of freedom, democracy and prosperity should reach the citizens of these countries by means of close cooperation with non-governmental organisations and the academic and cultural communities. Support for projects aimed at young people and women’s associations should also be a priority.</p>

Now the realisation has come over us almost like a thief in the night that people in the Arab world also aspire to and yearn for freedom. We are now talking a great deal about the risks associated with the transition. It is clear that they do exist.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the debate here in this House, which you have followed with interest, has one common denominator in particular and that is the demand being made of you, Baroness Ashton. Raise your voice. Move forwards, be a little more courageous and also be a bit louder. Stand up for those who, in a modern civilised society, are supporting democracy and freedom of expression and of the press.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tunisia, Egypt and perhaps a few other countries are about to undergo a difficult change. They need our support in this, and therefore it is wrong for your primary representative in this country to say that no change to the strategy is necessary. On the contrary, we need the Mediterranean strategy and perhaps the Middle East strategy, or perhaps a rethink on coexistence beyond the Mediterranean, and of course the top priority and something that needs to be done very quickly is the adaptation and preparation of, and support for, elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">It should not have escaped the notice of the primary representative of the EU in this country that the transitional government in Tunisia is now aiming to enter into four international agreements for the protection of human rights, that all political prisoners have been released, dissidents have returned and democratic elections are being prepared and conducted. We must support this process, and Parliament wants to hear you speak more forcefully on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, this crisis should give us the impetus to find out whether the European Union really wants a foreign policy role.</p>
      <p sl="it">Foreign policy is a serious matter: it needs strategies, firm objectives and clear alliances. We cannot continue travelling around the world patting everyone on the back and pretending that everything is going well all the time. Elections took place in Egypt a few weeks ago and we did not get up in arms because we realised that there was a dictatorship that was fooling all of us. Now that millions of people have taken to the streets, we are all talking about democracy and human rights. This is what we want, and we will try to make sure it happens, but we should be careful about following the crowd. I remember when the Iranian people rose up to get rid of the Shah, and we know how that ended, with a regime that still hangs dozens of people even now.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope, for example, that the Egyptian Government will be able to keep extremists at bay and play a stabilising role in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Baroness Ashton, more democracy is certainly needed in that part of the world, but so is more European policy.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, we are witnessing enormous tension and conflict between the government and civil society in Tunisia and Egypt, which has inevitably come about as a result of serious, long-term problems in the economy and society that were ignored by the state authorities.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The physical violence during the clashes is at best regrettable, and only confirms the urgent need for external support for a peaceful transition to democracy. The European Union should therefore be prepared to direct all of its resources towards strengthening the legal state and human rights in these countries, including religious rights. We do not want intolerant and militant Islamists to get into power.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Within the framework of maintaining good neighbourly relations and regional security, it is necessary to focus on activities aimed at strengthening civil society, creating a healthy opposition and ensuring democratic elections, in order to prevent extremist radial groups from usurping power.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the very fact that we are discussing Tunisia – our initial topic – at a time when Egypt has reached boiling point is indicative of how far we are trailing behind reality, even if the title of our debate can be changed with ease.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our public reactions have been timid, expressing concern and addressing pious appeals for restraint and dialogue in the middle of revolutions, demonstrating a lack of practical sense. Even the expectations that the revolutions would lead to societies based on our set of values ignore the cultural and religious differences separating those societies from ours.</p>
      <p sl="en">How to react then? First we should realise that this is a challenge asking for a common coordinating answer, not a competition on who demonstrates first the most compassion. Baroness Ashton, your words will carry the necessary authority with their audiences only if fully backed publicly by the Council in its entirety.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, we should start being preoccupied with the end result of those revolutionary movements. What kinds of regimes will result? And, in the end we should respect their right to decide for themselves.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, when the revolution that is currently taking place in the streets of Cairo ends, the Egyptian people will choose a political system and their leaders. The chances are that there will also be those who will give credit to President Mubarak for the positive role he has played in maintaining some degree of stability in the Middle East. That, however, is not the point I want to make right now.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The developments in Tunisia and Egypt reveal the marginal role played by the European Union in the Mediterranean and throughout the regions covered by our neighbourhood policy. We need to reform the European neighbourhood policy, we need a dynamic strategy which will address the resolution of ongoing issues, from Belarus, Ossetia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transdniestria, Cyprus, Palestine and Western Sahara. We need a strategy for the countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia and Transcaucasia. They, too, will be swept by the wind of democratisation; you do not need to be a prophet to see this coming. There is a great deal of work here for you, Baroness Ashton. Be ambitious and we will support you.</p>

It behoves us to support the democracies and democratic processes chosen by the people of these countries, not simply to impose our own vision.

      <p sl="pt">I am frankly concerned about the current situation in Egypt and about today’s developments, so I believe that we must not show calm but must rather show solidarity. We must show solidarity with the millions of Egyptians in Cairo and throughout the country who are sick of hunger, sick of oppression and sick of unemployment. That is why we must say that we have to stand side by side with these people following President Mubarak’s speech today, following the regime’s releasing of its hounds, and following its clearing of the way for violence. We must not allow a strategy of fear to be created to make them go home.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam High Representative, the European foreign service has a large number of employees, specialists and analysts. Our experts should therefore be capable of assessing the social upheavals both in Tunisia and in Egypt in a professional manner, and recommending appropriate steps to you, through which Europe will assist the inhabitants of these countries to overcome problems with unwanted political leaders. The ostrich-like policy we have displayed so far in relation to the civil unrest in African countries, however, gives rise to doubts over the ability of our foreign service to take action.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Madam High Representative of the European Union, if there is any further delay in mounting a professional response to current events in Tunisia and Egypt, our taxpayers will be justified in wondering why they are paying this multitude of different bureaucrats in the EU’s foreign service, if they are incapable of drafting an immediate and professional response for you to the stormy events in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, optimists believe that the revolutionary events in Tunisia and Egypt could be the beginning of something like an Arabic Spring of Nations – events like those we saw in Eastern Europe in 1989, for example. As Europeans, of course, we should always be on the side of freedom and democracy, and we would be very pleased if that were to be the case. However, we should not forget that we Europeans and the West as a whole have to a certain extent also entered into agreements with the most unpleasant and most brutal dictatorships in the Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should be under no illusion. Although Facebook, the Internet and Twitter are the modern means of driving a revolution, they do not replace the democratic structures and the rule of law that need to be in place behind the scenes for a revolution to be able to make the transition into a democratic system. What we Europeans can and should do is to make our position clear and to help to build these democratic structures in order, ultimately, to be able to bring the rule of law as well as a free market economy, which are necessary for a democracy, into these regions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me begin by being absolutely clear. I do not accept the principle that somehow Europe has been slow or late. We were the first to make statements on both Tunisia and Egypt. We began talking about Tunisia on 10 January and I put out statements on Egypt last week. We were ahead of everyone else. It is not a contest and it is not a race, but I do not accept that criticism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Neither do I accept that we were slow to act. We have been in contact hourly with those in Tunisia and with the people in Egypt, with our delegations, to whom I pay tribute for what they have had to deal with in the last couple of weeks, and also in direct contact with the government and with the services. You will also be aware of the other issues that we have been dealing with at the same time, so I do not accept that we have been too quiet. I do not accept that we have not done enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do accept that there is more that we can do. Did you give me all the tools I need with the Lisbon Treaty? Probably not. Did you give me all the resources I need? Probably not, but we will do the best that we can in the context, within which we have the External Action Service and the role that I have. I am not somebody who can go out and give my personal views. I speak for the European Union. I listen to you and I listen to the Member States and I listen to the Commission. That is the role that you set up in the Lisbon Treaty and that is what I will do.</p>
      <p sl="en">For some of you who were not here earlier, the Tunisian Foreign Minister was in my office today, making his very first visit outside Tunisia to the European Union because I invited him and because he knows how important we are, not just today but next week and next month and next year. When I speak to him I speak on behalf of Europe. He knows that what I say will be backed up by 27 countries, hopefully with the European Parliament’s support and also with the support of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">That means something to these people. It means something that when we speak it is one message, not necessarily – as people keep saying – one voice. It is the same message, whether it is said by the Chancellor of Germany, by the Prime of Minister of Britain, by the President of another country in the European Union, by any of the 27. We are saying the same thing. That is why the Foreign Ministers coming together on Monday, the conclusions that they drew and the press conferences that they gave on all of the issues that we are grappling with, in our neighbourhood and beyond, are so significant to the people on the ground. We must not lose sight of that in anything else that we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you that we need to be more active on the ground to do more and I absolutely agree that we need to revisit the neighbourhood policy. I have been saying it for a long time. We need to make sure that we have a more diversified approach, that we take each country and we work out what it is we want to achieve with the people of that country – yes, to do more with civil society, yes, to focus on human rights and democracy and, yes, to deal with the common foreign policy issues that we have with them. I agree. I am trying to do it. If you look at the work we have been doing in the last two or three months, you will see a common theme in what I have been saying, which has been the need to be more active in our neighbourhood. It should be our first priority after the setting up of the Service and it needs to be better, smarter and more related to their needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I cannot take responsibility for what happened before my time, but I do take responsibility for transforming what I inherited into a strategy for the future that you can be as proud of, as I intend to be. It starts with what we do now and how much we are able to take responsibility and move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not underestimate how difficult the situation is and how fast it is moving. I agree with those who have also pointed out that democracy is not a moment in time. It is a process. You build democracy and you bring out those organisations who can work with people to help them understand their democratic rights, what democracy can mean and what it can do – the transformation of society. We use that word in the Council conclusions for a reason, because I believe in transformation, not just for today and tomorrow but for the long term. That is what Europe offers. It is what Europe offered to our neighbours who became our partners and what it offered to its own members. It brought about transformation that will last for generations. That is what we are in the business of. We are not in the business of knee-jerk reactions and responses. We are in the business of doing something that we give to the people for their lifetime, for their children’s lifetime and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, of course, in all of this I have not forgotten all the other issues. I am watching what happens in Jordan. I am in touch there. I am of course engaged in what is happening in Iran. The weekend before last I spent in talks with the Iranians and you know how passionately I feel about human rights in Iran because of all the statements I have made, because of all the issues that we have raised.</p>
      <p sl="en">I certainly have not forgotten the Middle East peace process. I was speaking with George Mitchell yesterday. We will see Prime Minister Fayyad tomorrow. We are engaged with the Quartet. They meet on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, where I will chair the Quartet on that occasion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have not forgotten any of the other issues. Neither have I forgotten Albania, where Miroslav Lajčák goes back on my behalf this week to continue that dialogue. We do not forget everything else that needs to be addressed, nor indeed the issues that we will be debating in this Parliament tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">And I am not responsible for what Tony Blair says. I may share the same language; I may come from the same political party, but I am not responsible for him and I will not be held responsible for him either.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next week I go to the Security Council, on your behalf too. At the Security Council we again have the opportunity to show what the European Union has to offer for these people, for today and for tomorrow. It is really important that I get your support to do this – not quietly, I can be very loud – but properly with cohesion, with direction, with purpose, with a strategy and a plan so that, when the Tunisian Foreign Minister comes to my office, I give him a plan. I do not say, it is very nice to see you, come and talk to me in front of the TV cameras for five minutes. No. I said to him we are going to sit for an hour and we are going to work through your plan with what I think we can offer you. How much money? What can I do? What do I need to change? Which instruments do we need to bring together? How much flexibility have I got now? How much do I need to get? What do you need from us, the European Investment Bank, the African Union Bank, the United States, your other partners? How do we build the plan?</p>
      <p sl="en">Then I met the Yemeni Foreign Minster and we did the same thing: How do the group of countries that are friends of Yemen put together a new development fund? Do we do that with the Arab countries with whom I have been talking? What do we do?</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, that is how Europe should work, and that is what I do every single day on your behalf and will continue to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I am hoping that I can shortly leave this debate and ask another Commissioner to take over. For that I apologise but events in Egypt, as you rightly say, are moving and I can tell you what we have also been doing while we have been talking in here. We have sent messages, we have spoken to the Deputy Foreign Minister on my behalf. Messages have now gone in directly. The security forces have to intervene right away to stop an escalation of violence. That message has come from me while I am also sitting here talking to you. They need to take responsibility; the government is responsible for getting the army in to assist the people and to make sure that citizens are protected now. Ambulances have to be allowed in and out of the square, because we are hearing that they are not being allowed in. I am going to speak to Vice-President Suleiman as soon as I leave the Chamber. The call is being set up now and that is why you have to forgive me and let me go.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is an ongoing meeting that is trying to work out a road map with the opposition, now that European leaders are busy on our behalf talking to other leaders in the region and getting them to put in the calls as well. This has to be a telephone tree like you have never seen before of leaders talking to leaders, getting the messages into Egypt. While all this is going on, we have a crisis meeting going on in my offices to work out exactly what we will do in whatever eventuality we find ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what I have done every single day since this crisis began, with what happened in Albania, with what happened in Belarus, with what we did on Sudan, where our special representative led a task force and where Véronique De Keyser saw for herself on the ground what Europe was doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what we do. Could we do more? Of course. Do I wish there were four of me? Yes I do. Do I think that the tools are right? No. Do I think we have made progress? Yes. Do I think we can do much more? Of course.</p>
      <p sl="en">If all you want me to do is pop up and be seen to be alongside everybody, I will not do that. What I will do for you is deliver what I think Europe was created to do, which is to put democracy and human rights at the heart of every single action we take and support the people of Egypt and Tunisia today.</p>

      <p sl="it">Over the last few days the situation in Tunisia and other countries on the southern Mediterranean rim has come to a head. Dozens of people involved in violent demonstrations against the high cost of living and the country’s lack of a free market have lost their lives. I would like to take the opportunity to recall that in 1995 the EU launched a partnership programme with the Mediterranean in Barcelona, which aimed to bring about economic, political, military and social cooperation. However, at present these aims are far from having been achieved. The dramatic situation in Tunisia demonstrates the urgent need for a European vision for the Mediterranean, or indeed the involvement of the southern rim countries in the current partnership and neighbourhood policies. The situation in Egypt has grown even worse in just the last few hours. There have been reports of several people being wounded and killed in clashes taking place across the country between the police and people demonstrating against President Mubarak’s government. I believe that the path we need to take in these countries’ interests, but in Europe’s interests especially, is that of supporting economic and social reforms capable of meeting the aspirations of much of the population and which ought to bring peace and a gradual improvement in living conditions in the countries of North Africa.</p>

      <p sl="en">In 1995, the European Union outlined the ambitious target of creating peace, stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean region. The Mediterranean countries obtained funding on condition that they would undertake the necessary economic and political reforms. None of this happened, however. In most cases the EU’s attempt to help its southern neighbours was rather led by the fear that Islamic radicals might come to power, thus threatening the stability of the region. Support for authoritarian regimes, as history shows, does not pay. It did not pay for the United States in South and Central America, and it is not paying for the EU either. Some critics are quite rightly calling us hypocrites. We talk about human rights, about the need for social dialogue, and about economic development, and yet for decades we have ignored the fact that Tunisia and other North African countries have been ruled by cruel and undemocratic regimes. It has to be said that this amounts to a dramatic failure for those who promoted such a policy. The embarrassing call made by EU representatives for Mubarak to organise democratic elections is just the sad outcome of this failed policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The wave of indignation in the countries of Africa and their peoples’ struggles, in particular, those of the peoples of Tunisia and Egypt, demand our greatest attention and solidarity. In the specific case of Egypt, whose people continue to fight for their social and labour rights, for social justice, for democracy and for freedom, we vehemently condemn the repression that, under orders from President Mubarak’s Government, has been and continues to be directed at the struggling workers and people, and we pay homage to the almost 100 Egyptian citizens killed by state violence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Just as in Tunisia and several other countries of the Arab world and of Africa, the situation in Egypt is intrinsically linked to the deepening of the crisis of capitalism and the violent antisocial offensive that characterises it, not least in view of the exponential growth of unemployment affecting young people and the exponential rise in food prices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The recent events in Egypt and the broad social movement that characterises them are also intrinsically linked to the courage, persistence and determination of organisations representing the workers, and of other progressive people’s movements that have been undertaking important actions in the struggle for many years and under very difficult conditions.

The societies of this region have not had an opportunity to express their ambitions, dreams or fears openly for a very long time. We do not yet know what the outcome of the events in North Africa will be. What is certain is that we should try to exert a greater influence over the development of the situation. After all, these events are taking place in countries in our immediate neighbourhood. Europe has in fact had a good deal of involvement in the region we are discussing. We have known for a long time that local governments have not always met all the expectations of their societies. The protests were ignited by the problems that most often stoke social discontent – poverty, despair and the arrogance of the authorities. I do not believe that Tunisia and Egypt are dreaming of democracy as it is understood in the West. The people are simply dreaming of a better life, and a better life does not necessarily mean democracy. Do they deserve a better life? Yes, they most certainly do.

      <p sl="en">The first conclusion to be drawn from the profound changes taking place in Tunisia, Egypt and elsewhere is that the democratic world was absolutely unprepared for them. The EU as well as the USA were caught by surprise and still have to improvise in reacting and accommodating themselves to these revolutionary developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same happened 20 years ago when the Soviet Union collapsed. It turned out that thousands of sovietologists had dismissed in their analyses the latent powerful force which finally disabled the Soviet dictatorship - the will of the enslaved people for freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current situation has exposed an inherent weakness of the fledgling European common foreign policy. It has exposed a chronic crisis of the values upon which the EU is officially based. In Realpolitik, these values have systematically been neglected or undervalued in favour of stability or pragmatic short-sighted relationships.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a moment to understand that looking away from the suppression of freedom with the justification of safeguarding stability and economic interests is bound to lead to devastating political mistakes. Only genuine democracy can provide for a long-term stability. Relying on autocratic regimes means increasing the bubble of self-deception which will explode sooner or later, resulting in grave moral losses for their democratic partners.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Experts believe that the riots in Tunisia have caused a domino effect. It is highly likely that the next country in the region to experience change, after Tunisia and Egypt, will be Yemen. Libya, Algeria, Jordan, Syria and Morocco have also been mentioned. Globalisation, and the accompanying free flow of information, is opening the eyes of the citizens of these regimes. They want change, a decent life in a modern democratic state and legislation adopted according to transparent principles. In situations of this kind, the EU should promote these values and do everything it can to ensure that the Arab countries avoid civil war or the taking over of power by extremists. I would like to stress that our support must be limited to political measures, and must not include military action. As the EU, we should support the Arab countries in the peaceful pursuit of reforms. There is a clear need for dialogue, both with the representatives of the outgoing authorities and with the opposition, including Islamic movements. The EU needs to be more present in the region, and the entire European neighbourhood policy needs to be revised, which will make it possible to promote democracy more effectively not only in the Arab countries, but also in countries neighbouring us to the east, such as Belarus. We need effective strategic plans which include appropriate EU financial aid for promoting democracy, civil society and human rights. I believe that the EU should speak with one voice and express unequivocal condemnation for anti-democratic regimes.</p>

I welcome the EU mission in Tunisia to evaluate the legal situation in the stage prior to elections and the observation mission for those elections: identical measures must be taken as soon as stability is achieved in Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, I consider it extremely important to revise the neighbourhood policy, which we have witnessed failing to commit to one of its goals: the promotion of democracy and human rights. I think that there should be greater diversity of approach in the Euro-Mediterranean agreements, which should have a direct effect on civil society.

      <p sl="en">While democratic progress in the Arab world should be encouraged, the strategic interests of the EU should not be endangered. The events in Tunisia and Egypt proved that autocracy is not a solution. Nevertheless, the same events do not guarantee a democratic outcome. Recent history showed that democratic revolutions can be hijacked by well organised, militant Islam. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 is a famous example of democratic upheaval that turned autocratic. We should strike a fine balance between the social policies of President Mubarak and Egypt’s strategic line. Egypt is a resilient ally, it joined the forces that liberated Kuwait and ensured more than 30 years of peace with Israel. There is hope and there is danger in the ongoing events in Egypt. The demonstrators and their legitimate demands are a genuine expression of the need to open debate. But there is massive potential for oppressive behaviour, practices and policies within Egyptian society. Female circumcision, approval for public executions, torture and strict interpretation of Islamic law are widespread. The Muslim Brotherhood is openly promoting this agenda and is credited with 20% of the electoral preferences. Caution should be exercised now if democracy is to have a future in Egypt.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The riots triggered in the Arab world by young Mohamed Bouazizi setting himself alight do not feature at all any manifest religious or ideological element. Socio-economic demands are naturally the prime concern at a time when, in Egypt, the rise in food prices has exacerbated the tough conditions in which half of the country’s 80 million population struggle to live, surviving below the poverty line on two dollars a day. I believe that our attitude towards the events unfolding in the Arab world must take into account, on the one hand, the natural support for the desire for freedom, but on the other hand, we cannot ignore the threats to global stability that may result from the collapse of this region, which is becoming increasingly unpredictable, chaotic or under Islamist influence. Alarming signs show that many of the protesters do not aspire at all to the Western model of democracy, quite the opposite. I cannot conclude without thinking about the Russian invasion of Georgia two years ago, when the Western world, taken by surprise, looked on in silence and just ignored it.. Once again we have crucial developments going on along the EU’s borders, catching us unawares. Once again, we are not involved in the action, even though this action directly affects European stability in many respects.</p>

      <p sl="en">The first foreign visit which the new Tunisian Prime Minister made was to the European Union. Baroness Catherine Ashton welcomed the PM and it was clearly appreciated that the EU was the venue for his first foreign visit. The choice in itself is important since the Tunisian PM wanted to give a clear message of the path he wishes his country to take. The EU stands for democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental principles. It stands for stability and security, in this case in the Mediterranean region. Tunisia is one of Malta’s closest North African neighbours. What happens during this transitional period is not only important for my country but also for the region. Considered a moderate state, I am optimistic that Tunisia’s foreign policy will continue in the same direction. Also I am hopeful that its domestic situation will improve. It is important that the EU is visible in its various aid and development programmes which can be addressed to Tunisia. Countries which embrace democratic values and contribute to stability and security in a region must be appreciated for their endeavours. That is why it is vital that the EU illustrates this appreciation both visibly and tangibly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The UN announced yesterday that over 200 people have died as a result of the disturbances accompanying the revolution in Tunisia. This is the tragic side of the events in the South which have come as such a surprise. It should compel every one of us to make all the more effort to achieve democratisation of both this country and the region as a whole, particularly since the old order is collapsing before our eyes in Egypt as well. Unfortunately, there could be no question of the European Union singing from the same hymn sheet. Let us not delude ourselves that the newly-established EU diplomacy will play a leading role from the outset, when the individual Member States have such strong particularistic interests. In the case of Tunisia, however, the instruments at our disposal are perhaps less spectacular, but they are capable of producing very tangible results. They include the EU neighbourhood policy, which is currently undergoing a review, and which should be modified appropriately in the view of current events. They also include the possibility of sending an EU observation mission, and there is probably no longer anyone who needs convincing of the need to do so. These are concrete tasks to which the European Parliament must now turn its attention.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to echo the admiration expressed during the debate in respect of the courage of the people of both Tunisia and Egypt in expressing their discontent and disappointment with their respective regimes. By now the unrest has escalated to the point of no return and the European Union must contribute to the transition process that has been sparked off. There have been some cautious voices calling for sustaining the status quo, especially in Egypt, arguing that overthrowing the regime might lead to a civil war, which in turn might bring religious fundamentalists to power. I find that it is not our business to foretell the possible developments in those countries. I would like to remind you that when the Eastern bloc was on the verge of collapsing, there were still some who would not have rocked the boat for fear of future instability in the region. Let us not make that mistake and instead let us help the people of Tunisia and Egypt to lay the foundations for true democracies in the best way we can. I am confident that Islam and democracy are not incompatible – Indonesia, a democracy, has the largest Muslim population in the world.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the referendum on the future status of Southern Sudan.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-196-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Catherine Ashton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission/ High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will read the statement and then, I am delighted to say, my colleague Michel Barnier will continue the debate and close it for reasons that I think the honourable Members have understood.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are witnessing what is a historic moment for Sudan and actually for the whole of Africa. The people of Southern Sudan have waited a long time for the chance to exercise their right of self-determination. The timely, peaceful and credible conduct of the referendum has been a remarkable success and one of which everyone should be proud.</p>
      <p sl="en">The preliminary results of the referendum in the 10 southern states were announced on 30 January and showed an overwhelming majority (99.5%) in favour of secession. We still await the final results, which will be out in the next couple of weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">We congratulate the Southern Sudanese people for the determination, dignity and patience they showed in turning out to vote in such large numbers. We also commend the Southern parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for their leadership, and the Sudanese Referendum Authorities for the remarkable job they did in organising the referendum despite the enormous challenges they faced.</p>
      <p sl="en">This referendum’s success is, above all, a Sudanese achievement but it also reflects the support of the African Union and the AU High-Level Implementation Panel led by President Mbeki, who helped the parties to move forward, as well as the sustained diplomatic attention it received from the international community, including the UN, the US and, of course, the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sudan has been high on our political agenda in Brussels during the past months. We discussed it in the Foreign Affairs Council both in November and in December. We agreed again on conclusions in the Foreign Affairs Council this week and we will continue to monitor the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">More than anything, however, I want to thank Véronique de Keyser, the Chief Election Observer for the South Sudan Referendum, and her team in the EU observation mission, for the important role they played in helping to create confidence in this process among the people of Sudan. The deployment of a large and experienced observation mission was an important and tangible European contribution, and I thank you most sincerely because I know you personally played such a significant role and it has been well recognised.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also provided technical expertise and financial support to the Sudanese referendum authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we wait for the announcement of the final results, I want to reiterate that the EU will respect the outcome of the referendum as an expression of the wishes of the people of Southern Sudan. We are encouraged by President al-Bashir’s remarks in Juba on 4 January, reaffirmed at the Mini-Summit on Sudan in Addis Ababa on 31 January, that the Government of Sudan will accept the results of the referendum, will be the first to recognise the new state and will extend full cooperation to it. We urge all stakeholders to continue to exercise restraint and to ensure that calm prevails and that the safety and security of all peoples in Sudan are protected.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the referendum on self-determination for Southern Sudan was a major success, we cannot afford to be complacent. Huge challenges lie ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">The referendum on Abyei, which was supposed to have been held at the same time as the Southern Sudan referendum, has still not taken place. We are concerned at the violence that occurred in Abyei on the eve of the referendum and we urge the parties to prevent any further violence and to find a substantive solution to lay the foundation for long-term co-existence between local communities on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are other outstanding issues related to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement still to be resolved, including North-South border demarcation and the holding of popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan. We hope the parties will now refocus their energies on resolving these matters as well as key post-referendum issues including citizenship, security arrangements, oil revenues and other economic issues. We are encouraged that both parties have agreed on a number of principles, particularly to work for two viable states with ‘soft’ borders, and to build constructive relations. However, there is still a lot of work to be done and we will continue to support President Mbeki’s mediation efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also face an important humanitarian challenge. Every day some 2 000 people return to South Sudan from the North and they need help to reintegrate into their local communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remain deeply concerned about increased violence in Darfur, leading to the recent displacement of tens of thousands of people, and the severe impact this is having on humanitarian operations. Three European citizens are still being held hostage.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also continue to have concerns about the detention of human rights defenders, journalists, opposition politicians and peaceful student protesters. One of the basic principles of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was the establishment of democratic governance based on respect for diversity and freedoms, and we want to see respect for fundamental freedoms and genuinely inclusive democratic governance in both North and South.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking to the future, I assure you this will remain high on our agenda. We will continue to engage with both Khartoum and Juba. We are ready to step up our engagement with Khartoum and prepared to strengthen our dialogue. We remain committed to providing assistance to the people in the North, particularly in war-affected areas such as the east, the Transitional Area and Darfur. Southern Sudan will not be stable if Northern Sudan is not stable, and vice versa. EU Foreign Ministers have said they are ready to look closely at EU support for international debt relief for Sudan, consistent with political progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Southern Sudan, the EU has a significant contribution to make to stabilisation, development and institutional capacity-building. We are already providing support for basic services and agricultural development – in addition to the significant bilateral programmes of Member States – and we are looking at our longer-term strategy for development cooperation with Southern Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we also recognise that Darfur deserves the same high-level attention that has recently been focused on implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. So we appeal to all parties to cease hostilities, conclude a ceasefire agreement and move towards a comprehensive and just political settlement, and we will step up our efforts to encourage all parties to engage seriously in the Doha peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a word on justice: lasting peace in Darfur cannot be achieved without justice and reconciliation. There has to be an end to impunity. The Council has repeatedly drawn attention to the obligation of the Government of Sudan to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe the EU has an important role to play in supporting a peaceful, stable and democratic future for the Sudanese people, whether in one country or two. We owe it to the Sudanese people in both North and South to stand by them and offer them support and encouragement at this critical time.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the Sudanese Government in Khartoum is giving out positive signals, which include the smooth running of the referendum and a willingness to accept the referendum results in Southern Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After decades of civil war, I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that this is a historic moment for Africa. But historic moments are transient – they do not last forever. If we are to turn the page and move to a new period in history, the actors of change cannot afford to rest on their laurels. They need to define clear, healthy and viable foundations that will ensure a better future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Southern Sudan is in a transitional period, as a great deal could still happen between now and 9 July, the date on which it formally gains its independence. The two states have a lot of issues to resolve. The question that most urgently needs to be resolved is that of borders. The status of Abyei remains uncertain. A solution must be found in order to prevent conflicts emerging.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then there is the question of the so-called returnees. What reception will be given to these people? Will this young state succeed in integrating so many people in such a short time? Stable institutions need to be created – justice, police, the army and a full-blown administrative system – in order to ensure that these individuals can enjoy citizenship, find work and have decent living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet the referendum also constitutes a real challenge for the North: the authorities will need to adjust to a new political reality. There have already been demonstrations this weekend. Will the government encourage political, ethnic, cultural and religious diversity? One thing is certain: we cannot afford a repeat of past mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For both countries, the key to success resides in guaranteeing a pluralistic political arena with ethnic and religious diversity under the overriding rule of law. Only then will these countries constitute true democracies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to add one last thing. Economic, social and political interdependence should encourage the authorities in both countries to engage in constant dialogue and cooperation. For its part, by offering genuine development projects, the European Union will be a key partner in the future of both countries.</p>

    <intervention id="3-198-000" speaker_id="22097" name="Véronique De Keyser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, following on from the discussions about Tunisia, Egypt and other countries that are currently calling for freedom, I would like to say that our observation mission to Southern Sudan for the referendum was a wonderful and exemplary experience. The referendum was exemplary because it was a success, notwithstanding all the doom-mongering. It was also a wonderful experience because it was apparent that the people of Southern Sudan were voting with tears in their eyes – after waiting for this moment for so long (more than 50 years in some cases), after having lived through civil war – and were embracing the peaceful transition with indescribable joy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the coming months will be difficult, but we do need to celebrate this turning point. I have to say that in the light of the European Union's instruments and how much I have criticised other election observation missions that did not enjoy a successful outcome, the mission that I took part in was a real blessing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Southern Sudan is set to become the fifty-fourth state in Africa on 9 July. It currently faces a number of challenges, as outlined by Baroness Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly there is the oil in the Abyei region, located on the border between North and South, but for which no clear boundaries have been defined and which did not have its own referendum. A solution needs to be found for Abyei, but at the moment the question is still pending. Violence occurred in the area during the referendum, as was also the case in the Unity State and South Kordofan. This region has the potential to destabilise the whole country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then there is the issue flagged up by Mariya Nedelcheva – whom I would like to thank for her participation in the observation mission – and by Baroness Ashton: citizenship. The people of Southern Sudan who lived and worked in the North, sometimes even owning property, have fled to the South in tens, even hundreds, of thousands. They will probably now have to be reintegrated in the southern economy. They do not trust the North, they do not know whether they will be able to keep their jobs – almost certainly not if those posts are in the public sector – which is a serious problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, there is the problem of the International Criminal Court. Salva Kiir, the president of Southern Sudan, wants to seek cooperation with the North, provided that it recognises the result of the referendum. He has already succeeded in persuading President al-Bashir to visit the South, where he was formally received in Juba. This was astounding, representing reconciliation and a new era. Salva Kiir tells us that if he were to sign the Rome Statute today, he would be required to arrest President al-Bashir the next time he comes to visit. He questions how they could cooperate under those terms, how they could achieve the much-vaunted North-South reconciliation. ʻDo not ask us to do that,’ he argues. Obviously, we are committed to the International Criminal Court, but at the same time we realise that North-South cooperation is the key to peace.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So I fear that there are lots of problems to be resolved. As I said, the mission was a wonderful experience, but Sudan remains one country until 9 July.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-200-000" speaker_id="840" name="Charles Goerens" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, for over twenty years we have known that the population of Southern Sudan does not want Sharia law imposed by Khartoum. Hence a civil war which has taken the lives of over two million people. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 put an end to that war.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last week, the will of the Southern Sudanese people was formally expressed: independence, secession from the North. But wanting is not enough: the country also has to be able to manage that independence on a day-to-day basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new state does not yet have a formal border with the North. Nor do we know how the profits from oil extraction will be shared out. Thousands of people are still moving from the North to the South. As yet the potential for development remains fairly unclear, given the limited resources in Southern Sudan on the one hand and the incredibly low levels of education on the other. Essentially, this new state will have to be created from scratch.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although the creation of a new state is primarily the concern of the people of Southern Sudan, independence will trigger some fundamental changes. Henceforth, any conflict between North and South will be an international issue, rather than an internal problem, as it has been in the past. So for the UN Security Council, the rules will change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We urgently need a clear strategy identifying the main political and economic priorities that will bring the people of Southern Sudan out of extreme poverty. Whilst respecting the right of all nations to self-determination, as the established primary donor, the European Union has to be able to meet the expectations of people on the ground. The European Union should also take on the mantle of leader of all those who will be working in partnership with the new state in the Herculean task of reforming this part of Africa.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are bearing witness to the birth of a new state. I am very pleased about that, but I have concerns, as well. After all, Southern Sudan is one of the poorest countries in Africa. It is also a country with a great deal of oil in its territory. Moreover, it is a country to which a lot of people are returning, refugees without anywhere to live, without food and without jobs. That is a recipe for disaster and even a recipe for armed conflict.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unless those who control the oil resources in Southern Sudan and the ports in the northern part of the country through which that oil has to be shipped come to an agreement, then indeed, as my fellow member Mr Goerens has said, an international conflict will break out. So, what can we do?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe must establish a presence there and must stay there. Why not send a Eupol mission to Southern Sudan to help establish the rule of law and give this country a fresh, new opportunity of its own and, who knows, that country might well prove to be an example to the rest of Africa. I very much hope that that will be the case.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have never doubted that Sudan’s partition is the only way to guarantee peace, justice and development for Southern Sudan. I am therefore delighted that southerners voted with such overwhelming determination in favour of a sovereign, independent future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact that more than 99% of voters favoured secession is a damning indictment on Khartoum and President Bashir’s decades of efforts to conquer and subjugate the Christian and Animist South to hard-line Islamism and Sharia law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Southern Sudan should now be the EU’s number one humanitarian development priority. The referendum is not the end of the process but the start of it. Southern Sudan needs to be sure of the EU’s total and unswerving commitment, and one of the things I call upon the High Representative to ensure is that all EDF money should now be transferred to the new state immediately, even before they ratify Cotonou.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also call on all 27 EU Member States to immediately recognise this new African nation on 9 July as decreed in the CPA. Without it, all the progress that Southern Sudan has made in recent years will be in vain. Another war would have unimaginable consequences for Africa as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I hope that steps are being taken to ensure that the personnel and financial resources allocated to the EU delegation in Juba are adequate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also trust that the High Representative will be able to visit Southern Sudan shortly. I am also excited, particularly as a British citizen, that the new government in Juba is committed to recognising the independence of the Republic of Somaliland – the former British Protectorate of Somaliland – and I am convinced also that many other African and European states will shortly follow thereafter.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to recognise in the gallery Dr Francis G. Nazario, who is head of the Southern Sudanese Mission to the EU and shortly will become its ambassador. Perhaps you could stand up, Dr Nazario and the Southern Sudanese delegation, who are also sitting up there.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, will the situation now improve for the people in Southern Sudan or is the split more in the interests of the West so that we can get control of the oil reserves? In any case, the South has huge challenges ahead. Without a functional infrastructure and with the current disastrous economic situation, civilian assistance and humanitarian aid will be needed for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, the danger of violent conflicts has probably not been eliminated for certain. However, experts believe that this cannot be resolved by military means. On the contrary, a focus on military means prevents a real solution to the conflicts being found. The necessary civilian assistance can be provided much more efficiently without military involvement. The transfer of civilian tasks to the military hinders the sustainable development of civilian structures.</p>
      <p sl="de">An example of this is Darfur. A massive military apparatus has now taken over the tasks of humanitarian and development organisations there, something that has been sharply criticised by these organisations. Our demands are that the focus be on purely civilian conflict management and assistance measures, in other words a reduction of the UN mission to the civilian components and no potential use of EU battle groups. In addition, in terms of a development perspective we call for Sudan’s debt be written off.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, every sign indicates that the result of the 9 January referendum in Southern Sudan will be virtually unanimous support for independence. That is perfectly understandable, or reasonable, and, indeed, should be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">After all, Southern Sudan has recently left behind it 23 years of civil warfare with the Arab north, in which 2.5 million people were killed and more than 4 million driven out. That is without even mentioning the slavery in the north, to which possibly hundreds of thousands of Southern Sudanese women and children fell victim. Against this historical background, it goes without saying that this youngest state in the making could do with any international assistance it can get in building up its institutions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, that process certainly requires a reliable police force. Just last week, I received some worrying reports in connection with that, that is, reports of serious malpractice in the new police academy in Rajaf. I would therefore call for European attention and efforts to help address this, but also, equally, to assist with all the urgent state affairs which Southern Sudan will be facing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there are two things that I brought back from the trip to Sudan: firstly, a belief in the viability of Southern Sudan and, secondly, the fact that there is no alternative to this belief in the viability of Southern Sudan. However, as in the case of a small child, it is also necessary to support this young state until it is able to be independent. That is simply what the international community is called on to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to address two points. Firstly, debt write-off. As an Austrian MEP this is of particular concern to me because, after all, Austria is the largest creditor in the Paris Club. I believe that we have to lead by example here and, even if it is a task for the Member States, it is nevertheless very important that, under the supervision of the European Union, there is excellent coordination of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point that I would like to mention here is the situation of stalemate that we find ourselves in: on the one hand we have the arrest warrant from the International Criminal Tribunal and on the other there is also the will and the need to pay out money from the 10th European Development Fund. I think that we need a swift but very pragmatic solution here.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are very pleased that the referendum in Southern Sudan has passed off so peacefully. Our observers are united in their praise for what they saw during the observation mission. They have also given a positive assessment of the referendum itself from the viewpoint of the standards we promote. The referendum was credible and well-organised, and it gave voters the opportunity to make their views heard. The importance that Southern Sudanese citizens attached to this referendum was also plain to see, with a turn-out of 60% being achieved by the fourth day. This is clear testimony to how determined the people are to achieve self-determination.</p>
      <p sl="pl">President Bashir has often been criticised by this House, but this time we should give him credit for the statement he made on 24 January in Juba, to which Mrs Ashton referred. He announced that he would recognise any decision made on the basis of the referendum, even if that meant the secession of Southern Sudan, and everything points to the fact that those living in the region have made their wishes extremely clear. I would echo the wishes and hopes voiced by others that, if Sudan is in fact split into two countries, they will enjoy a peaceful co-existence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is now important for the peaceful atmosphere that reigned during the referendum to be followed by a peaceful period during which the results can be announced and the two states can undergo transformations. Many observers are afraid that the current wave of riots and democratic demands in several countries, including Sudan, could become an excuse to freeze the peace process and will make it impossible for ambitious plans to be put into effect. The outlook in some quarters is positive, on the other hand, for example in the African Union, which is known to be ready to recognise the independence of the new African state. We must also be aware that the referendum is not the end of the matter, and that ultimate success means realising the wishes of those living in Sudan. As we know, their wishes may be granted on 9 July 2011, when the independence of Sudan will be proclaimed, and only then will we be able to celebrate the end of this bloody and long-standing conflict.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, after four decades of civil war, with a toll of more than 2 million dead and 4 million refugees, Southern Sudan’s secession is a response to ethnic and religious intolerance, in the wake of the 2005 report and the referendum which took place a month ago. The sides involved have agreed on this separation, and I firmly believe that this will speed up and facilitate Southern Sudan’s acceptance into the international community. However, there is a risk of a domino effect on a continent traumatised by wars caused by artificial borders inherited from colonial times. This is why the six-month period of transition towards the clean break is crucial in terms of defining the new state’s future path.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the one hand, it is faced with military and strategic challenges, the resurgence of violence among former military leaders of the secessionist movement, interference from some militia, privatisation of internal security, border incidents with Muslim Sudan and the issue of dividing the oil revenues with the latter. On the other hand, there is a great humanitarian problem, and I think that the European Union must get involved in this on a major scale. Otherwise, we will be faced with a disaster which will fuel the instability in the region. In Sudan one in ten children die during the first year of life and one in seven die before they reach the age of five. There is limited access to drinking water and healthcare services, while four fifths of the population are illiterate. Half the population in the south is under 18 years of age and, if they escape the clutches of child mortality, they are at risk, due to poverty and the lack of prospects, of ending up as cannon fodder in the conflicts which may undermine the new state’s independence.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that the European Union will take into account how complex this issue is.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am delighted that the people of Southern Sudan have been given the freedom to choose their future. I am proud to be able to say that the final undisputed outcome has been obtained thanks to strong support from the international community and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are approaching an historic turning point: establishing lasting peace and a new state in a country which has lived through nearly 40 years of civil war in the 55 years since its independence. This marks a new era, the era of negotiations between North and South on the issues that need to be resolved in order to implement the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement: citizenship, defining borders, deciding whether the Abyei region will be held by the North or South, sharing oil resources and debt matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union will, of course, need to support both this political process and the new state's development. The international community and European Union must not forget about Northern Sudan, just as we must not forget Darfur, where the conflict is far from resolved and where violence has increased considerably over the past 12 months, with over 270 000 individuals forced to leave their homes and more than three million still living in camps.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the European Union’s fundamental principle is democracy and, given that the vast majority of Southern Sudan’s inhabitants have democratically voted in favour of independence, the European Union must give its support to the immediate creation of the new state. We have to do so because, amongst other reasons, democracy is the foundation for stability, security and prosperity in Africa, as well as in the Mediterranean. In the same vein, I would also stress the international importance that the right to self-determination is taking on as a tool for international relations: we have seen it in Kosovo and we are now seeing it in Southern Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="es">The International Criminal Court itself has concluded that democratic independence processes are perfectly legal under international law. The establishment of borders is returning to where it has to be: democracy. Therefore, in order to strengthen the Union itself, the EU must also be prepared to recognise the right to self-determination of any European countries – such as Catalonia, Scotland or Flanders – that democratically opt for independence.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, these are apocalyptic times. From Mauretania to Oman, people are in flux. All over the world, thousands are dying in natural disasters. In America and Europe, the dance around the golden calf of the euro and the dollar is getting wilder all the time. Christians are being persecuted in many countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nobody knows when the end of the world will come, but the Bible commands us to be watchful and ready.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, in the midst of this global tumult, we are witnessing a wonderful development: the birth of Southern Sudan. After many years of oppression and war, the people of Southern Sudan are being freed from slavery. The people of Southern Sudan are being liberated from the house of slavery which is headed by the internationally wanted criminal Omar Al Bashir. That is a cause for great thanksgiving and joy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I warmly congratulate my Southern Sudanese friends present here today on this. I pray that this new country may have wisdom, so that law and justice can flourish there. May it be a country where mercy and faith meet together. May it be a nation where peace and justice are intertwined.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would specifically ask the Commission, represented here by Mr Barnier, to recognise the new state of Southern Sudan immediately, that is, as soon as possible. Follow up on that recognition with action. Support Southern Sudan wherever possible. Make this country a priority of your foreign policy. I am looking forward to a specific response from you to my request.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is an opportunity for the Sudanese people, of both North and South, to concentrate on growing their economies and using the wealth that their oil resources can bring to feed and educate their people, but we must also help, and do so without delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently 80% of southerners have no access to toilet facilities. One in ten children die before their first birthday. In the poorest parts of the South, less than one percent of children finish primary school. Every year Sudan exports billions of dollars of oil. If North and South can arrive at a diplomatic and peaceful solution – and they can – then both parties can use their rich natural resources to haul themselves out of their dreadful poverty – the poverty that plagues their land – with some help from their friends.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course the future of both governments will depend on issues such as border demarcations, the sharing of oil revenues and the status of Abyei, the disputed oil-rich border region between North and South. I urge the High Representative and the Commission to encourage rapid diplomatic negotiations between North and South to resolve the remaining issues in as short a timeframe as possible and, most importantly, to keep this item high on the European Union’s agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to welcoming parliamentarians from both sides, representing their states in their own right, to a future meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the ACP countries with this Parliament before too long. It will be an indication that they have arrived at statehood. I think it is something we should encourage sooner rather than later.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to break up this joyful atmosphere.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true that we have come to the end of the phase begun in 2005, during which diplomacy helped to ensure that events unfolded in the best possible way. However, there are still many unresolved problems. This is a young country and will be a young country once secession has taken place. It is a country that still needs to establish its borders, address the issue we have heard mentioned several times of the conflicts in the Abyei region, the issue of the oil pipeline, which is the most important thing in that country, and also the international aid system.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore like to make a very simple point to the Commissioner. There are two or three things that we need to do. We need to establish a strategy for Southern Sudan, and recognise this new State on 7 February, without waiting until 9 July when the results of the election are made official. We also need to put our international service into action immediately, and establish a delegation in Southern Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the only way to support a process; this is the only way for smart, strategic diplomacy to support this country on the path to democracy. I would note that the first thing that the country needs to do is to draw up its constitution, and Europe can be of great help in this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I began working at the European Parliament as a political adviser in 1991 and at that time the conflict between northern and southern Sudan was already a recurring crisis. Finally, after 20 years, it seems we are seeing a bit of light at the end of a long, arduous tunnel.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Mr Milana and others have pointed out, much still needs to be done, but many of us were preparing for the worst and expecting the civil war to start up again. I therefore congratulate the north and south of the country on this initial referendum result. Every day counts now until the declaration of independence. No-one can allow themselves to put a foot wrong, either in Khartoum, in Juba, in Brussels or at the African Union in Addis Ababa. For example, the idea of opening an EU delegation with special status until the declaration of independence is definitely to be welcomed. Sudan is about to teach us,the international community, a wonderful lesson about cynicism and about crises that, more out of a sense of resignation than anything else, we often consider to be unsolvable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I welcome the future independence of Southern Sudan and I congratulate the Southern Sudanese people on having achieved it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As our fellow Member, Mr Goerens, who has been so kind as to approach me on this occasion, has just said, one can have the right not to live under Sharia law. It is a right that we must honour. However, I must also point out that there are some populations that are blessed with the opportunity of obtaining the right to such freedom. Nearby, the people of Somaliland do not have that opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like us also to revise our policy, which, up until now, has consisted in not recognising the efforts of the people of the Republic of Somaliland, who have built a free and democratic Muslim state in the region, but one which we treat as if it did not exist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as regards Southern Sudan, I would also like to say a word on the status of the country. Southern Sudan is still the poorest country in Africa despite the fact that, during the past five years, it has been able to access half of the oil resources of the whole of Sudan. I can see that there has been blatant underdevelopment, which, up until now, has largely been due to the neglect and oversight of Khartoum.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, from now on, I would like the European Union to insist on the need for governance and development, and not to help finance the underdevelopment that is liable to be created in Southern Sudan in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we should resist the temptation to be over-optimistic during today’s debate. Predictions of events in Sudan are nothing but crystal-ball gazing. In spite of all the hopes raised by the recent referendum, it should not be supposed that the matter is already settled. That is far from the case, and no one knows yet whether the country will be divided according to the wishes of those living in the South.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A further issue is the fact that the southern part of the country is currently united by its dislike of the Muslim North. When this emotion passes and the time comes for the building of state institutions, the balance between the three culturally and linguistically different tribes will rapidly become apparent. This issue will be of great significance, and we should turn our attention to it now.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The next question we must ask ourselves, and to which we must find an answer, is as follows: why are we now hopeful of a peaceful end to a conflict which has lasted half a century? The answer is clear: crude oil. Both foreign concerns, without which it would be impossible to extract oil in such a poor country, and the representatives of the two parts of the country have caught the scent of petrodollars.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us hope that greed does not blind us, and that our desire to help not only ensures that funding will be provided for state-building measures, but will also allow us to put in place programmes which will benefit society.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, prior to the referendum we were very concerned about the accompanying unrest, and I am pleased that the referendum went off peacefully and that it was valid. However, it is necessary to ensure, as Baroness Ashton said, that there is a proper additional referendum in Abyei, as well as in the region where oil is located. The observer mission of the European Parliament will also be needed at this additional vote.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Even after the independence of Southern Sudan is declared, it will remain one of the poorest countries in the world. There are many Slovak NGOs working in the region, and it is important for them to have the right conditions for their work. I would also like to emphasise the role of the local church and church organisations, as they too deserve our support. They have set up and are running many schools and medical facilities, and they are highly respected in the region.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to end by saying that, following the break-up of Sudan, we must not forget the minority of South Sudanese who fled to the North in the face of persecution, and have been living there for many years. If North Sudan fails to recognise dual nationality, as President al-Bashir has promised, Sharia law will apply, and they may become second class citizens.</p>

Thanks to a democratic process, a complex society, with ethnic and religious differences, and with serious economic disputes, has brought an end to a conflict that cost two million lives. I should therefore like to congratulate the principle players in the process and give recognition to the role of the United Nations, which fulfilled its peacekeeping mission. Moreover, I should like other conflicts to follow this example and I hope that certain states here will lose their fear of principles like people’s right to choice and the exercise of the right to self-determination.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ambition, obstinacy, failure to recognise minorities and their rights, and failure to accept plurality are the cause of many tensions.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, unfortunately I do not share the huge optimism expressed by most speakers in the House. Firstly, because we must ask ourselves why Southern Sudan in particular acquired its independence ‘so easily’, at a time when the regime in the Western Sahara is as we know it and did not recognise its right to independence. For me and the Greek Communist Party, the answer is very simple. Southern Sudan had the good fortune to have oil.</p>
      <p sl="el">We hope that its oil does not end up being a curse for the people of Southern Sudan, as it was for the people of Iraq and other nations. There are still serious, unresolved problems. We believe, unfortunately, that competition between the major powers for this area will increase and we call on the workers of Southern Sudan not to give in to the strategy of divide and rule and to join with the workers in Northern Sudan in creating different prospects for their country.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the most recent referendum in Southern Sudan, the people decided that the old, arbitrary colonial borders should fall. In July, the world’s 193rd state was officially founded. There were 3.8 million people who voted in favour of an independent state and only 45 000 voted for things to remain as they were: this represents an overwhelming majority utilising the right to self-determination, and it is grounds for great joy.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the split alone will not create stability in the country. Sudan is still a trouble spot, and in the north there is the omnipresent radical Islamism. In addition to other measures, it is therefore important for administrative structures to be developed, because a new border needs to be managed and also monitored.</p>
      <p sl="de">This requires an efficient security policy throughout the entire region – in Somalia, Sudan and Southern Sudan. The High Representative of the EU is called on, together with the international players, to promote security and stability in this region and, above all, to combat radical tendencies and to bravely support Southern Sudan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Of course, the real work is now beginning in making the transition to freedom and nationhood for Southern Sudan. That is very difficult and the history of the world has shown it has often led to civil war.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the European Union can play a crucial role in ensuring that transition takes place, so that the people of Southern Sudan can have the basic human rights which Mr Mitchell referred to, such as education and even toilet facilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that, in particular, the border and the division of oil resources are going to be crucial issues. A famous Irish hero, Michael Collins, once said that border land is trouble and always will be.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton asked me to listen to each of you, and I have listened attentively. I would like to thank you for your understanding, as Baroness Ashton had to leave the Chamber for urgent reasons after she had explained her position, as High Representative, on the extremely sensitive issue of Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this huge region of Africa, it is clear to see, and, ladies and gentlemen, all your speeches have shown, that what happens in a country may affect all the other countries in terms of development, peace and stability. It must be remembered that there are nine countries bordering on Sudan. That is why what has happened with the referendum is so important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs De Keyser, whose role as Chief Election Observer I would like to acknowledge, recalled, as did Baroness Ashton, the success of this referendum – an exemplary process and a transition that has to be peaceful. Since she has done so herself, I, too, would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament and others for the good cooperation demonstrated by this process between the European institutions and, in particular, the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, several of you have spoken of Darfur. For my part, I have not forgotten the time when, in 2004, at the height of the crisis, I, as the then French Minister for Foreign Affairs, went to Al-Fashir in deepest Darfur, and what I heard and saw there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I am happy that I have been given this opportunity to comment on this situation on behalf of Baroness Ashton. We are paying a great deal of attention to it and we are, of course, following the developments with great concern for what is happening today, while naturally deploring the many violations of human rights and the kidnapping of United Nations personnel. That is why we expect all parties to embark on this peace process. Naturally, we must support this peace process. This is the objective of our political action, of everything that is being done to create stability and, even more specifically, of our humanitarian aid, of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I wish to point out that, since 2003, the European Union has contributed EUR 776 million to humanitarian cooperation with Sudan, in particular to Darfur, which badly needs it, and to Southern Sudan. I would also like to point out or confirm that the Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO) will remain proactive, and I wish to thank all the personnel who have worked alongside ECHO with regard to the reintegration of people returning to Southern Sudan from the North in cooperation with the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards cooperation with Southern Sudan, the European Union will provide more assistance in this extremely specific area in order to promote a rural development and agricultural production capability, which these people so desperately need, so that they are not forever reliant on imports, which are becoming more expensive due to price volatility. Those who know me know my unwavering commitment to this, today as Commissioner and previously in other capacities. The Commission spoke about this issue at length in its communication this morning. Therefore, in the vital areas of rural development, agricultural development, basic services, education and health, the Commission will continue to increase its assistance. We are currently planning to create special funds of some EUR 150 million for the most vulnerable population groups in Sudan and, naturally, Southern Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I wanted to say. Very briefly, I would just like to make three further comments. On the issue of citizenship, which has been raised by several Members of Parliament, I would like to say that we fully support the work carried out by the Panel led by President Mbeki, which is facilitating negotiations concerning future citizenship and other issues linked to this serious problem of citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning the international tribunal, the European Union will continue to support the International Criminal Court without any reservations. Time and again, we have called on all the authorities, in particular those of Sudan, to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to say a final word on a subject that several of you have raised, that is to say, debt. I would remind you of the Council’s latest conclusions, which were very clear: the European Union will support debt relief for this country by taking account, as other partners do, of the progress we are expecting, and which we want to accompany and encourage politically and economically in order to ensure the stability of the country.</p>

      <p sl="de">The fact that, in the referendum, Southern Sudan voted in favour of a split was to be expected. It was also to be expected that this would by no means put an end to the problems in the region. For one thing, the South is still unstable and it must first prove itself as an independent state. This may possibly happen before the projected date in July, because the loss of 25% of the land area and 20% of the population will not hit Northern Sudan nearly as hard as giving up a considerable proportion of the oil revenue. For that reason, the EU must help the new state to maintain its independence and to protect its sovereignty, because development aid for Southern Sudan may also play an important role with regard to Europe’s oil supply in the future. The EU should therefore take a leaf out of China’s book, particularly since Beijing is cleverly linking development aid to the supply of raw materials. Thus, both sides profit from the Chinese model. The problem of illegal migration to Europe must not be disregarded either. An agreement must therefore be concluded with the government of Southern Sudan regarding the readmission of its own nationals who have entered the European Union illegally. We will then have to watch closely to see whether Southern Sudan is actually prepared to fulfil this agreement.</p>

    <intervention id="3-228-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Enikő Győri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the honourable Members – my dear ex-colleagues – for giving me the opportunity to comment, on behalf of the Council, on the appointment process of the chairs and executive directors of the new European Supervisory Authorities – the ESAs – and on the principles that should guide the performance of their duties.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ESA regulations, which we adopted less than three months ago, give no specific role to the Council in the appointments of the chair and executive director of each ESA, which are made by the respective board of supervisors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Hence, in accordance with the ESA regulations, the chairperson of each ESA is appointed by the board of supervisors. Furthermore, the ESA regulations give a crucial role to the European Parliament, which has been granted the possibility of objecting to the appointment of those senior executives and of removing a chairperson from office following a decision of the board of supervisors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where, then, does the Council stand in this scenario? Well, the Council, as co-legislator, has agreed with Parliament to insert in these regulations provisions that aim to ensure that members of the board of supervisors – the management board – the chairperson and the executive director of each ESA are protected by, and bound to, strict independence so as to act solely in the interests of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not quote in full the provisions of those regulations, and more particularly Articles 42, 46, 49 and 52, but their spirit is clear. This is that neither the voting members of the boards, nor the chairperson or executive director, shall seek or take instructions from EU institutions or bodies, Member State governments or any public or private body, and that these, in turn, shall not seek to influence the chair or the executive director in the performance of their tasks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ESA regulations are subject to the staff regulations adopted by the EU institutions. They also contain a number of key provisions that aim to ensure that the chair and executive director of each authority are selected in the most objective way, on the strict basis of the criteria set out in Articles 48 and 51 of the regulations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Apart from the managerial experience specific to the executive director’s profile, I note that both those articles list as criteria ‘merit, skills, knowledge of financial institutions and markets, and experience relevant to financial supervision and regulation’.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as financing is concerned, the Council placed high ambitions on the ESAs when it adopted the regulations, and I am sure that was also the case with Parliament. It now falls to both institutions, as budgetary authorities, to ensure that those ambitions are translated into the appropriate means each year, on the basis of the Commission’s budgetary proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency also attaches great importance to all Member States fulfilling their obligations towards the new authorities. For the Council, as co-legislator, it is essential that all the provisions of the regulations are implemented completely and faithfully. We expect the European Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that this is indeed the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the honourable Members will be aware, the Commission is also entrusted, in recital 55 of the regulations, with the responsibility of drawing up a shortlist of candidates to steer the process of selecting the first chairperson of each authority. Parliament and the Council agreed to this starting procedure when adopting the regulations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the chairpersons will now be able to start their work. It is of primary importance for the new agencies to be up and running as soon as possible. They are an essential part of the EU’s response to the challenges posed by the financial crisis. We cannot afford to wait, and I am sure I can count on the full support of Parliament to ensure the smooth establishment and running of the new agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of the good cooperation between Parliament and the Council, the EU has a brand new supervisory authority structure. It is our common responsibility to ensure that ESAs get down to business as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the representative of a Parliament-friendly Presidency, I am fully commited to working in maximum harmony with the European Parliament, and I also hope to be able to work with a Parliament that is a faithful partner.</p>

    <intervention id="3-229-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has had a new supervisory system for the financial sector since 1 January.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This system, combined with the fundamental reform of the regulation of the markets and financial operators will enhance financial stability in the Union and, I believe, will expand opportunities and lay solid foundations for the financial industry, which is extremely important in our countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to begin by congratulating the European Parliament on the key role it has played in this process for several years. That we now have a more effective supervisory system for the financial sector and are drawing on the lessons of the crisis in this area, as in others, is largely due to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are now approaching the final stages of the creation of this new architecture of the three European Supervisory Authorities with the appointment of their chairpersons and executive directors in the next few days. Ladies and gentlemen, these appointment procedures were conducted with complete transparency and in full compliance with the regulations that created the authorities as well as other rules governing the appointment of the heads of the regulatory agencies of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Approximately 275 applications were received for the six posts I have just spoken about. They were all considered carefully and objectively. The roles allocated to the different stakeholders, to the European Parliament, to the board of supervisors, and to the Commission itself were scrupulously adhered to. In the future, we will continue to ensure that the process is transparent and properly planned so as to enable the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) of the European Parliament to play its very important role to the best possible effect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This Parliament has made, and continues to make, big demands of these authorities, and I think it is right to do so. It is making demands that I can understand. Like Parliament, the Commission takes the view that the chairpersons and executive directors of these authorities must be chosen on the basis of merit, experience, independence, their commitment to Europe and their knowledge of issues linked to the supervision and regulation of financial markets. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the spirit in which the selection procedures under way have thus far been conducted on the basis of the applications we have received.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, since Parliament and the Council decided, in Article 68 of the regulations creating these authorities, that the chairpersons and executive directors would be subject to the rules applicable to the staff of the institutions of the Union, the Commission has ensured that that is what is happening and that, in this area as in others, the regulations are being complied with.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, you have expressed concerns with regard to the salaries and the maximum age of the senior managers of these authorities. In this respect, we have explored all avenues in order to obtain maximum flexibility and this issue may, if necessary, be re-examined when the functioning of the authorities is reviewed, which is scheduled for the end of 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also endorse the intention of this Parliament to achieve the optimal gender balance at the head of these authorities. In the preselection procedure the Commission rigorously applied the principle of equal opportunities on the basis of the applications that were registered. I note in this regard that, in the latest process for the appointment of the executive directors, which is ongoing and has not yet been completed, two very able women are in contention for a post as executive director.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I fully agree with Parliament that we need strong authorities, which are independent of political or other interference. The chairpersons, executive directors, and voting members of the different boards must be completely independent and act solely in the interest of the Union. Parliament and the Council have enshrined this principle in the regulations creating the authorities, in particular in Articles 42, 46, 49 and 52, which Minister Győri referred to just now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission, as the guardian of EU law, will totally and fully assume its responsibilities to ensure that these Articles are rigorously complied with. I would add that the Commission will be present in the governing bodies of the authorities and that, in this regard, it will, of course, be vigilant so as to ensure that any decision that is taken in the interest of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the composition of the board of supervisors, the Commission has already highlighted the legal necessity and the political importance of ensuring that these boards are composed of the heads of the competent national authorities. I have personally written to the authorities to clarify this point, where it needed clarifying. Some national authorities have since modified their representation. Others still have to do so. You can rest assured that the Commission will keep this point under very close scrutiny and will be inflexible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The composition of the boards of the authorities must fully respect your wishes and those of the legislator in general, and I will personally see to it that the heads of the national authorities are actually present at least, and I repeat, at least twice a year in accordance with Article 40 of the regulations that created these authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the intention of this Parliament to ensure that these authorities have the necessary financial and human resources to perform their duties in a credible fashion. The budgetary authority can count on the technical support of the Commission to ensure coherence between, on the one hand, the responsibilities assigned to these authorities and, on the other hand, naturally, the resources allocated to them to assume these responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now essential that the procedures to appoint and confirm the chairpersons and executive directors of these authorities are completed successfully. These authorities need to get down to work. I can assure you that, every day, I have proof of the usefulness of these new authorities, since we currently consult them on an almost daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The tasks that these authorities have to assume in cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board are of the utmost importance. We wanted them to be fully operational from 1 January. It is now the responsibility of each of us, in our own particular role, to allow them to perform their task swiftly and under good conditions. To achieve this, they need the full support of your institution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to reaffirm here that, for its part, the Commission will ensure that the intention of the legislator is fully respected and that these authorities work exclusively and solely in the interest of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barnier, this debate right now is not a legal debate; it is a true political debate. It is a debate on the future of financial regulation in Europe. It is the culmination of one aspect of the work conducted by Parliament, with the Council, under the guidance of the Commission. I am therefore going to be quite clear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For us, it is not about indulging in some sort of revolution or showing our biceps just for fun. It is about ensuring that the spirit that presided over the agreements between the Council and Parliament is, in fact, respected. It is not a lesson in law. The texts do not matter. We know the texts. What matters is the way in which these texts will be put into effect. In this regard, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the clarity of his speech.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have never sought to call the Commission into question, and the words spoken by the Commissioner are totally in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. We are talking here about a political act that consists in saying: ‘These institutions have been established, so we must give them the concrete resources to function properly.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet, I think that we do not simply have doubts but also suspicions about the way in which these provisions have in fact been implemented by a number of Member States, by those that wish to unravel European supervision and prevent financial regulation at European level. That is what we are speaking out against, because we believe that, if that had been the case, we would have been cheated in the negotiations on supervision. The negotiations were long; they were difficult. Everyone made compromises. The Belgian Presidency did some remarkable work and the Commissioner provided extraordinary impetus. Today, we could be faced with institutions without effective power: due to the low status of the staff appointed; due to the fact that the Member States did not choose the best, and perhaps because the salaries were not attractive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any event, today Parliament needs a concrete answer. Minister, I am bound to say that, despite the friendship that I feel for you, having sat on the same bench, in the same group and on the same committee as you, the letter, which I have seen and which, I admit, is only a first draft, is inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will give you the response of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is simple. You say, on behalf of the Council, that you fully endorse what the Commissioner has just said. I can tell you that, for us, this will be a satisfactory declaration. The statement made by the Commissioner is precise. It deals with problems of human and financial resources. Your letter needs to state: ‘We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said’. Mrs Győri, this is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said in plenary this evening.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, why are we here? Mr Barnier said that we are here because the European Parliament has succeeded in establishing European supervisory authorities that are worthy of the name. That was not part of the Council’s programme. It was not part of the Member States’ programme. The Commission, too, had doubts about how long we would actually persevere with regard to the establishment of this new institution. The Council will understand – it will have to understand – and the Commission will, too – possibly even of its own accord – why we are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">No, this European Parliament – and this is a statement that I find applies to all party groups, not just to us as Social Democrats – will not allow national games to be played that undermine the powers of these new supervisory authorities. That is why we are interested in the appointment of staff, of course. We have rights in this regard – we have to be consulted.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are one or two things that in fact give us cause for concern. We receive lists of individuals and we receive lists, which when we look at we cannot actually tell whether a gender criterion has been applied. We are given proposals for candidates, which when we consider – and I say this with all due respect to the people concerned – we do not see anyone that we believe could not do a decent job. These are clearly good people who have already shown in their jobs that they can do their work well, but the people that have been presented to us are not people who, on the basis of any authority that they may have demonstrated in their past work, can actually say to the national supervisory authorities where they would stand in the event of a conflict. Where there is European supervision, national momentum comes to a standstill. That surprises and annoys us, and it must call us into action.</p>
      <p sl="de">No, these procedures are unsatisfactory, and I ask myself why, for example, we cannot take the same approach as we are taking with regard to those responsible for OLAF, where you are of course interested in the opinion of this House. Why can we not do that? We still have another opportunity with regard to the executive directors. You can still demonstrate that you are interested in the opinion of the European Parliament. You still have another opportunity. I would urge you both – President-in-Office of the Council and former fellow Member Mrs Győri and Commissioner Barnier, to take this opportunity. You can take on board the objections of this House. You can tell us very clearly how you want to work with us in future. You can tell us very clearly what goals you will support in the 2013 reform and how you will equip the institutions. You will also be able to make it very clear whether you are interested in our opinion in respect of those members of staff that are still to be appointed. I therefore ask you in all earnestness in the interests of Europe to provide these rules quickly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, thank you for being with us this evening. We are well aware that there was limited time available, so we thank you even more for having begun to answer us. I think it is important to put our motivation clearly into perspective, as my fellow Members have done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What motivates us is that we have fought collectively for months to ensure that there is a ‘before the crisis’ and an ‘after the crisis’, that, in this internal market, which has facilitated the expansion of financial services and banking activities, and we are entirely in favour of all the cross-border work done by the sector, common rules and supervision are brought into line. To be frank, during the negotiations – and with the support of the Commission moreover – it became very clear to us that we were being troublemakers. We saw all too clearly that there were some Member States that wanted to remain in control of the supervision and did not want anyone to poke their noses into their business.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Győri, you tell us that the Council has no say in the appointment of these officials, which is legally correct, but some Member States are lying in ambush. Moreover, the Commissioner pointed out that his departments had to tell some countries to send pre-eminent people. Therefore, this Parliament is doing its work, in trying to ensure independence, resources and the resolve to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are, of course, aware of our responsibilities. We, more than anyone else, want these authorities to set to work, since we have contributed personally to their emergence. We have no desire to delay their work; I am thinking, for example, of the bank stress tests, which are so important. However, the simple fact is that, as has been pointed out, we will be demanding, we are going to sleep on the issue and take the necessary time to look in detail at what you have told us, each of you in turn, and we will take a decision with a clear conscience.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank Mr Barnier for having made some very clear statements and I would ask you, Mrs Győri, not to be naive. There is a lot at stake.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this is a question of making the best possible use of the possibilities provided by the law to actually provide strong financial supervision in Europe, and we have our doubts about whether these possibilities are in fact being utilised to the best possible extent in the institutions. We are seeing shortcomings in the procedure. As Parliament, we have so far not been able to see the list of candidates in advance, but only the finished result. It would be very easy to send us this list now for the executive directors. We quite clearly have a lack of gender equality when it comes to filling the posts, and, due to certain events during the process, we have our doubts about whether the Member States will in fact fill the posts in this institution in the interests of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">That and the other points in our letter entitle us to ask a fundamental question. However, over and above this there is, of course, also the question of the suitability of the individuals, and in this regard each person has to be assessed individually on the basis of their skills. We see two major problems with this. In the hearings, we found that one of the candidates disputed the fact that this was a European institution, but talked instead about a network of supervisory authorities, and even when asked about it he was not prepared to correct this.</p>
      <p sl="de">We did not receive any clear responses when we asked them whether they were prepared to make all lobbyist contact with the financial industry transparent. We have sent a letter to all three candidates, and as far as we are concerned the outcome of the vote is dependent on whether we receive clear and comprehensive responses to this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Any comments I make this evening are purely about the process that has been followed to get to this point. I would ask, therefore, that future selection processes aim to recruit candidates from the broadest possible pool of talent in order to ensure independent thought and a new diversity in the senior management of such authorities.

Unnecessary age restrictions, or any other criteria outside technical skills and competence, should be avoided at all costs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I believe there is no need for these agency supervisor posts because I believe there is no need for the agencies themselves. Is creating another level of supervision called ESMA going to represent an improvement compared with existing supervisory authorities? I believe that, by doing this, we are only going to cause confusion about who is responsible for what.</p>
      <p sl="en">Will the supervisory authority produce regulations suitable for the world’s largest financial district? I doubt it. I think, instead, that the pet theories of the anti-market crowd will be adopted and forced upon the City of London. The problems caused by financial activity in recent years were due to rule books being either torn up or ignored by those whose job it was to enforce them.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no guarantee that these authorities will do anything better. Moreover, we have been presented with only one candidate for each post – a totally undemocratic exercise. Of course, it is the same that was used to appoint the President of the Commission, the rest of the Commissioners and the High Representative. I could go on with a long list.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I will be brief, as I have expressed myself as sincerely and as clearly as possible. I have carefully weighed each word of my statement, which will be confirmed in writing in a letter that I have co-signed with Vice-President Šefčovič so that things are extremely clear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In response to each of your speeches, which I thank you for, I would simply like to mention three issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first issue concerns the independence and the authority of the chairpersons of the authorities. I am very pleased with, but not surprised by, the total commitment of Parliament, which is shared by the Commission, to defend this independence and this authority and to ensure that they are respected over time. It is crucial and it is what is important for the future, bearing in mind the multitude of tasks and the seriousness of the tasks that these authorities are going to face. Earlier, the issues of the rating agencies and the stress tests were raised. These are issues for which we are going to need the authorities and their credibility. This is the first point I wanted to make, on which Parliament and the Commission, of course, and, I hope and believe, the Council, can agree.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point is that of the selection procedure. Ladies and gentlemen, I remember the discussions at the trilogues, where this procedure was the subject of numerous debates and, finally, of agreement among the co-legislators. It is what it is and it doubtless has its shortcomings. I personally brought in the rendez-vous clause to improve it. I have no reason – and I say this to you in all conscience – to think that it has not enabled good candidates to be selected. I have no reason to question the motives of the candidates chosen. After I had received the shortlists and met each of the candidates in person, I personally took responsibility for establishing an order according to what I felt, in all conscience, were the most useful and the most credible criteria. However, in order to find these good candidates, we relied on the lists given to us and the 275 applications from the regulatory authorities of the Member States. We have a rendez-vous clause to improve these procedures, which undoubtedly can be improved. But I would like to say, in all conscience, that, as far as I am concerned, I have no reason to say or to think that we have not selected good candidates, who are capable of living up to their responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, there is a third point, which a number of you have raised, which is that of the level of representation of the authorities. The Commission will always ensure that this representation is in full compliance with the regulations and at the highest level. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the European Parliament for supporting us in this absolutely crucial issue, which is also one of the keys to credibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that is what I wanted to say, before we all retire to sleep on it, as a previous speaker said. That is what I wanted to give you as an assurance, as a concern, which I would like to express personally on behalf of all the Commissioners, for vigilance to ensure that these authorities succeed. This will provide genuine European supervision, which will not replace national supervisory authorities but make them work together more effectively, which will have its own powers when facing challenges and risks, which are now clearly transnational.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We needed, and we now largely have, thanks to you, these three radar screens, these three authorities in addition to the European Systemic Risk Board. Ladies and gentlemen, it is now necessary for everyone to get swiftly to work because, frankly, I note that the markets are moving very quickly, much more quickly than us, in this, our time of democracy, and the authorities need to work very quickly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, first let me answer the question which came up very often in this debate: will the Council agree to review the appointment procedure in the regulation?</p>
      <p sl="en">Well I know that the same recital states, for the subsequent designations of the chairpersons, that the opportunity of having a shortlist drawn up by the Commission should be reviewed in a report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also know that Article 81 of the regulation also makes provision for the review by the Commission to be sent to the European Parliament and the Council by 2 January 2014 and every three years thereafter. So this will give us an opportunity to improve the regulation in due time on the basis of practical experience, and in this spirit I look forward to a constructive dialogue between our institutions to pave the way for the future assessment.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the speeches delivered by the Commissioner and me were framed by our respective competences. We received the letter of the Chair of the Economic Committee, and both of us tried to answer questions fitting into our respective competences. I tried to convince you that there are guarantees of independence and, in the creation of the budget, the task of the Council and Parliament, as the two institutions having financial responsibility, is to ensure that these institutions are in operating condition. As such, it seems to me that there is clear task sharing and unambiguous commitment on the part of all institutions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The letter sent today by the Chair of ECOFIN, Minister György Matolcsy, in reply to the letter sent by the Chair of ECON this morning, was written in this spirit, and I trust that, along with the Commission’s opinion, you will find it to be a satisfactory response. The Council and the Presidency-in-Office fully support this. This was the question of Mr Gauzès, which the Commission answered regarding the topics within its competence. I therefore hope that, after this, there will be no obstacles to Parliament supporting the candidates tomorrow, and the supervisory authorities will finally be able to commence their work.</p>

The candidates for the posts of chairpersons of the ESAs have, in fact, proven to be competent and professional, and I am sure that they will be able to carry out the role in an impartial and more than satisfactory manner. I think it is crucial to support the candidates and to ensure that these Authorities are in a position to start work as soon as possible, since there are many problems to resolve and they require immediate action.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has been called upon to express its opinion on two agreements that have been signed with the United States and with 11 Latin American countries, which will draw a line under a long and difficult affair. This affair has witnessed the European Union challenged at the World Trade Organisation, and more importantly has witnessed it as the losing party.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a thorny issue, as the disputes relate to the principle of non-discrimination in international trade, which Europe has been accused of breaching in the way in which banana imports are organised within the Union. This is because we have a two-track system in that we apply one system to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and a different system to other countries. This system allowed ACP countries to bring this product to the European market without paying any import duty, unlike other countries, which have to pay a duty of EUR 176 per tonne.</p>
      <p sl="it">This agreement therefore brings the situation back into balance and most importantly allows ACP countries, which are in a fragile state of development, to export their products to the EU duty-free. At the same time, the other countries that have signed the agreements will be able to export bananas to the EU subject to the payment of import duties, which however will be gradually reduced over the period 2011–2017 from the current rate of EUR 176 per tonne to EUR 114 per tonne.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, as well as finally bringing the EU back into line with its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation and therefore in some ways restoring its credibility, including as an institution, the most important aspect is that these agreements make allowances for ACP countries in a vulnerable state of development, as they provide for instruments to give them financial support. These instruments will allow those countries to invest in diversifying their production and will therefore hopefully strengthen their economies. At present, these measures, worth EUR 190 million, are to be provided until 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that these agreements are a positive step, not only because they draw a line under disputes in which the EU has been the losing party, with the ensuing consequences in economic and disciplinary terms and in terms of its institutional credibility as I already mentioned, but also because they lead to a balanced solution that respects the needs both of these ACP countries and of European producers in the outermost regions, who certainly cannot be abandoned to unbridled competition.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore propose that Parliament should approve these agreements, whilst asking the Council and Commission for firm commitments. In the first instance, they should provide, as quickly as possible, for an evaluation of the impact that these agreements will have between now and 2020 – quite a long timescale, therefore – on ACP countries and on European producers in the outermost regions, whose economies are closely tied to bananas. Secondly, Parliament should ask for a firm commitment to evaluating the effects of the financial accompanying measures earmarked for the ACP countries eighteen months before they are due to end. This would ensure that those countries could receive further assistance and support measures if necessary, so that they are not left to go it alone and are supported in combating, counteracting and mitigating to some degree any negative consequences that the entry into force of these agreements may have within the European Union due to the price adjustments and hence to changes in the competitiveness of bananas from other countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore believe that by resolving a tricky issue this agreement definitely provides a way out that also takes into consideration the needs of those weaker countries which, as I have already said, have always been our main concern, including during the long debate we had in the Committee on International Trade. I hope they will find strong support and a favourable solution in these accompanying measures, in particular in terms of monitoring and the commitment, which Parliament is asking of the Commission and Council, to look at the impacts of the agreement and the effects of the aid measures, and to extend and increase them if necessary in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Mrs Balzani, ladies and gentlement, I would like to thank you very much for having given the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Council the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is important both from the point of view of international trade and from the point of view of solidarity and development.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope to be able to reply to the questions asked by Mr Moreira and to address the misgivings and concerns which Mrs Balzani has mentioned. If I may, I will now continue in Hungarian.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards the livelihood of banana producers in the EU and in ACP countries, the Council is aware that banana production is of fundamental social and economic importance to the banana-growing regions of the EU. The draft regulation stipulates that the Banana Accompanying Measures programme must be evaluated 18 months prior to the programme’s expiry. However, ladies and gentlemen, as you are aware, the preparation of this evaluation report and any further proposals falls within the competence of the Commission, and not the Council, but I am sure that Commissioner Cioloş will elaborate on this. The same applies to the impact assessments referred to in the question for oral answer.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The implementation of the Banana Accompanying Measures covering the ACP countries requires an amendment of the regulations on the EU’s set of foreign relations instruments. In the interest of the beneficiary countries, the Council is counting on the constructive cooperation of the European Parliament in resolving the institutional issues that are currently delaying the adoption of the required provisions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards the distribution of resources allocated to the Banana Accompanying Measures between the beneficiary countries, the Council, in its position adopted in the first reading, expressed support for the draft regulation on the Banana Accompanying Measures, which lays down unambiguous indicators and criteria for distribution. These indicators are the following: the volume of banana trade with the EU, the importance of banana exports to the economy of the ACP country concerned, and the level of development of the country.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Concerning the POSEI programme, the Commission submitted a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on 24 September 2010, which lays down individual agricultural measures for the outermost regions of the EU. The proposal is currently being examined by the preparatory bodies of the Council. As regards the banana duties discussed under the free trade agreements to be concluded by the Commission with Columbia, Peru and Central America, I would like to stress that the Council has not yet formed an opinion on these agreements, and I therefore cannot relay its official position to you at this point.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The EU began negotiations with the entire Andean Community with a view to creating an interregional association agreement. The talks were suspended in June 2008, because the Andean countries could not agree on the objectives and content of the chapter on trade. New negotiations began in January 2009 with the willing Andean countries, namely Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, in order to reach a multilateral free trade agreement. After Ecuador suspended its participation in July 2009, talks continued with Peru and Columbia. The European Commission closed its negotiations with Peru and Columbia on 1 March 2010.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The multilateral agreement negotiated with these two countries is open for other members of the Andean Community, including Ecuador, to join. In the past months, Ecuador has also indicated officially that it is ready to resume negotiations and join the multilateral agreement. The Council welcomes this decision. If negotiations with Ecuador continue, the level of ambition of obligations in the field of market opening must reflect the level of ambition of the obligations negotiated with Columbia and Peru.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In conclusion, I therefore ask the honourable Members to give their consent to the conclusion of the banana agreement, and also to vote tomorrow for the proposal to repeal the regulation establishing banana duties. I am counting on your cooperation and would like to thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mrs Balzani, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I am delighted to note that the main aspects and the general orientation of the Commission’s proposal on bananas have been supported by the rapporteur. Furthermore, Mrs Balzani gave a very good introductory presentation of the context in which these negotiations have taken place and in which this agreement has been signed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission unreservedly supports the conclusions of the rapporteur’s draft recommendation and the draft report on this issue. It is true that the 2009 Geneva Agreements on bananas are very important, and Mrs Balzani emphasised very well the reasons why this is so. I would also like to point out that these agreements will bring peace on this thorny subject, and that they will also facilitate the Doha process and bring about the conditions necessary for establishing a stable European banana market, one which will be predictable over the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to come back to some of the most important issues raised by the rapporteur and the MEPs in their oral or written questions, as well as those in the motion for a resolution which forms part of the package.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the support given to European Union producers, I am very aware of the essential socioeconomic role of banana production in the European Union regions concerned – particularly the outermost regions – and of concerns about the economic viability of banana production in these regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a recent report on the POSEI system, submitted to the European Parliament and the Council in September 2010, the Commission explains the consequences of the Geneva Agreements and the fact that these consequences have already been integrated into the 2006 reform of the system applicable to bananas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to protect European Union producers in a context of increased liberalisation, the budget for the banana sector was increased considerably, and the impact assessment carried out at the time took into account the fact that tariffs had fallen more than had been agreed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nonetheless, the Commission has shown that it is willing to keep a close eye on the impact of the agreements on the market and, if need be, to take the measures necessary to mitigate their effects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the question of strengthening the position of banana producers in the sector, I would like to emphasise firstly that this question is not unique to the banana sector, but applies to the entire agro-food sector. These problems in the producer sector – problems with negotiating power and the distribution of added value along the food supply chain – affect other sectors too. In order to address this, furthermore, as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, the Commission will table proposals to strengthen producers’ organisations, their role in the sector and their negotiating power.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the Commission has created a High Level Group for the Agro-Food Industry bringing together several Commissioners who can table proposals along these lines – because the responsibility and power of the Commissioner for Agriculture is limited, but there are four Commissioners who participate in these groups and run these High Level Groups – a High Level Group with a road map and with proposals, and the Commission will table these in the next few months and years in order to try to respond to this issue of transparency in the food supply chain and negotiating power. Thus, in this context, banana producers in the sector will be able to benefit from it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the distribution of financial resources for the ACP Banana Accompanying Measures, as you know, the draft regulation establishing the BAM was approved by the European Parliament on 21 October, and it lays down conditions for the distribution of these resources. Therefore, the criteria that you have asked for are already in place and, what is more, the results and the distribution of this envelope are already in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this subject, the Commission has worked in close and fruitful collaboration with the European Parliament, and we have reached a good compromise on the content concerning this point. The draft regulation intended to provide this support for the ACP countries has, moreover, been approved by the European Parliament, and it also defines the allocation criteria for the various beneficiary countries, but in addition provides what you are asking for here – an assessment of the market conditions in these countries, 18 months before the programme expires. This assessment will give us an indication of whether the adaptation processes are going well, or if we might have to envisage other measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the impact assessment concerning the effects of the agreements on banana producers in developing countries and the outermost regions of Europe up to 2020, I am indeed prepared to contemplate such an analysis if it proves necessary. However, we must also be realistic about the scope of the study, because it is aimed at a large number of banana-producing countries across the world – as well as a large number of countries in which bananas are a staple food – and it will therefore be difficult to conduct this study and to draw conclusions from it. Nevertheless, I am prepared to undertake a study of this kind, or to use any data on internal or external studies that the Commission already has at its disposal. As I have already said, we will carry out an assessment of the effects of the BAM on the ACP countries 18 months before the programme expires.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, regarding the negotiations on a free trade agreement with certain Latin American countries, in particular Ecuador, you will doubtless be aware that the negotiations on the trade agreement with Colombia and Peru and with the Central American countries have been concluded at a technical level. The agreement with Colombia and Peru can also be applied to other member countries of the Andean Community, including Ecuador, if it wishes to return to these negotiations. Ecuador has, incidentally, made an official request to return to negotiations on the trade agreement, and the Ecuadorean administration and the Commission are currently examining the possibility of restarting negotiations and thus the possibility of seeking an agreement on the steps to take.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the few comments that I wanted to make in relation to your report and to the issues that you have raised. I have spoken somewhat at length, but I wanted to answer those questions that I could from the outset.</p>

    <intervention id="3-248-000" speaker_id="840" name="Charles Goerens" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on">
      <p sl="fr">Development. − Madam President, one of the provisions of international law is the principle of non-discrimination. That is very good. In theory, it cannot be faulted. The reality is slightly different.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ACP countries do not pay import duties on bananas if they export to the European Union. This is an agreement – an acquis – and this agreement changes nothing about this fact. Non-ACP countries, on the other hand, which until now paid EUR 176 per tonne, will see their import duties fall to EUR 141. Reducing import duties by EUR 35 also changes the situation with regard to competition. The ACP countries, which received greater protection until now, will receive slightly less protection in future. The Commission negotiated this agreement on behalf of the European Union. For me, as rapporteur for the opinion, the question is whether it could have acted any differently. My answer is very clear: it could not. If it had acted differently, if it had refused to enter into these negotiations, the issue would have been adjudicated by the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO. It is fair to say that the results would have doubtless been different from those achieved during the negotiations being discussed here. Does that mean that all’s well that ends well? Certainly not.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am rapporteur for the opinion on this agreement, and I am also rapporteur on the Banana Accompanying Measures, and I will present the report tomorrow at second reading. I will make the following comments on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, the budget for the banana sector has been increased considerably. As the Commissioner has just reminded us, this is very good – I acknowledge that. This also answers a question by Mrs De Sarnez, who is very concerned about the situation that has just been created for banana producers in overseas départements and in the outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second, another concern that Mrs De Sarnez and I myself have, and that is also expressed within our Committee on Development, is that the downward trend will not end with the EUR 114, because the Commission is currently negotiating other agreements which will bring the figure down to well below EUR 114. There is even talk of EUR 75. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, we will also have to monitor this downward trend, which is very worrying.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Third, as regards the Banana Accompanying Measures – which I will talk about in more detail tomorrow morning – I believe that Parliament has succeeded – and I thank the Commissioner for emphasising this point – in introducing some new things, in particular the impact assessment that will take place 18 months before the programme expires. That will allow us to look a bit beyond 2013 as well, because I do not believe that the problem in the banana sector will be resolved by 2013.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of the PPE Group, I urge the European Parliament to give the green light to this very important agreement. We believe that this will facilitate the Doha Round negotiations and also provide an impetus to our bilateral negotiations with the Mercosur countries on a free trade agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the overall trend towards liberalisation of the global trade in bananas, including the current WTO agreement, as well as bilateral agreements with the Central American and Andean countries, and possibly one day with Mercosur.</p>
      <p sl="en">The motion for a resolution – and I pay tribute for this to our rapporteur – is a well-balanced one, especially since we have taken into account the interests of our partners from the ACP countries, as well as local European banana producers.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is my deep conviction that, while we move towards greater liberalisation of the global trade in bananas, we should make sure that we do not wipe out industries or sectors that have traditionally played important economic and social roles in certain European regions, such as the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Madeira, the Azores and others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we hope the Commission will take these concerns into account and will take steps to adjust the support package for domestic EU producers earmarked in the POSEI envelope and, if necessary, take other steps in order to ensure that, in parallel to the trend of liberalisation of the global trade in bananas, domestic EU producers are able to remain on the market and foster their traditional activities. A good opportunity to do that will be during the discussions on the next EU financial perspective.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we all know the meaning of ‘banana republic’. It is a country in which the large banana-producing companies make and break governments at their will. When governments inconvenience them by trying to retain minimum government rights or increase basic wages, they even use coups against them.</p>
      <p sl="el">In these countries, the same companies continue to produce bananas. The destruction of forests and the environment, the miserable working conditions and the use of pesticides banned in the European Union are daily occurrences. At the same time, because of these multinationals, 99% of the bananas we eat are one species, even though there are several thousand species of banana, and this species is at risk of a specific disease as a result of single crop farming.</p>
      <p sl="el">The measures to support the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries were very important and reducing them would have a serious impact on producers in those countries. These are very poor countries that need our help. The European Union is, globally, the biggest and the most profitable banana market. Over coming years, we shall indeed see these huge multinationals trying to gain absolute control of the EU market by ousting smaller producers, and this is honestly where we need to pay attention. The Commission needs to be on the alert to ensure that European competition laws are complied with to the letter, so that we can prevent the large multinationals from abusing their dominant position on the market by artificially depressing prices to start with, in order to oust small producers, and then creating cartels and increasing prices, so that they become very expensive to European consumers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">These agreements are aimed at opening up the banana market by strengthening the dominant position of the large US multinationals, which already control more than 80% of the world market. If we approve agreements of this type, we will be acting against the interests, in particular, of the ACP countries, the outermost regions and Ecuador. Once again, small producers will be the ones who suffer. There must be an urgent, radical overhaul of international trade rules to guarantee food sovereignty and the development of local production for all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The financial measures proposed by the European Commission to support these producers are insufficient. The European Union must not only ensure that an impact assessment is carried out in relation to these agreements; it must also amend its legislation accordingly so as to promote sustainable production and sustainable economies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in my opinion, these agreements are not positive. They provide a demonstration of how small banana producers, in the ACP countries and the outermost regions, have been taken hostage in the agreements concluded in 2009 in Geneva and in the Doha negotiations which are taking place today, agreements and negotiations which the World Trade Organisation desired and imposed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the fate of small producers in the ACP countries and the outermost regions counts for very little given the powerful interests which are at stake – not only the interests of the Latin American giants, but also those of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The reform of the banana market and the reform of the sugar market are basically expressions of the same inexorable shift towards a large global market, which, unfortunately, is crushing the weakest and most fragile. Furthermore, Madam President, the compensation measures envisaged will not be enough to ultimately prevent the ruin that lies in store for small planters, nor to lead the ACP countries, which are some of the poorest countries around, towards genuine development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, we are being urged to sign these agreements in order to save the Doha negotiations. If only our leaders were urged to show the same willingness to save global agreements aimed at the protection of the environment and the upwards harmonisation of workers’ rights and living standards. If this were the case, then I believe that people would be much less hesitant about globalisation than they are today.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, for decades, the European Union has been pursuing a protectionist trade policy, and that applies to bananas, amongst other things. The purpose of our import tax is to keep Latin American bananas out, while at the same time we hand out subsidies to exporting countries who are competitively weak.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Most of these subsidies, nearly EUR 300 million a year, go to the outermost regions of the European Union: this is sheer protectionism, over which the EU has had its knuckles rapped many times by the WTO. The European Union is all too keen to present itself as an advocate of international law and free trade, always ready to wag the moral finger at others.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, when it comes to the European Union, we prefer to turn a blind eye. Everything is permitted as long as the unprofitable banana industry on islands such as French Guiana, the Azores and the Canary Islands is protected. We seem all too keen to tolerate the fact that the European taxpayer is having to foot a bill amounting to hundreds of millions of euros every year on such wasteful subsidies.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would respectfully inform Mr Campbell Bannerman that his banana is not from the Canary Islands.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about bananas in this plenary sitting and I think that it is positive that bananas are being talked about here. It is positive because it is important to reiterate the need for EU banana producers to be protected, including those in the Canaries. I think this because I believe that the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas is not good news for EU producers. Moreover, there are aspects of the resolution that we are debating today that are not completely satisfactory from the point of view of agriculture and of protecting EU banana producers.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I am aware that this proposal originates with the Committee on International Trade, whose criteria relating to several issues are very different from those that I am able to have. I will therefore assess the positive aspects of the proposal and not the negative ones.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is positive that it brings to a close so many years of disputes in the World Trade Organisation, thus restoring tranquillity to a sector that needs certainty and stability for the future above all else. EU producers belong to the outermost regions, which have enormous problems producing bananas – or excellent-quality ones, anyway – and whose banana production is nothing like that in third countries in any respect, including in terms of cost, workforce, the environment or of plant protection safeguards.</p>
      <p sl="es">From an agricultural point of view, it is important to stress that the agreement is damaging to EU producers. We are facing drastic cuts in tariffs, from EUR 176 to EUR 114 per tonne and EUR 75 per tonne in the case of the agreements with Colombia and Peru.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect, I can tell you that it is not credible that there were provisions for this drop in tariffs in the financial detail of the 2006 Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), because it is not true. The Commissioner said that it was provided for in relation to the Geneva Agreement; let us bear in mind that this tariff is EUR 114. There could never have been provision in 2006 for the tariff to decrease to EUR 75 as there is following these agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe that the necessary evaluations should be carried out and it will be confirmed that it is absolutely necessary for the financial details of the agreement to be updated because, inter alia , the Commission already saw the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne itself as low when it was implemented. EU producers are not, therefore, asking for anything that is not wholly justified, and we in Parliament have an obligation to protect them, as does the Commission.</p>

Although EUR 200 million has been designated for African and Caribbean banana exporting countries, we need to look at this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Anyone witnessing how people who work in this sector are treated, particularly by the large multinational corporations, would be quite disgusted.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European producers often lose out in bilateral trade agreements and have been damaged by the liberalisation of import regulations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreements we will be voting on tomorrow provide for a reduction in the import duties applied to bananas imported from Latin America. Whilst on the one hand these agreements have helped to resolve a conflict that has been going on for a decade, on the other hand they threaten to leave European banana producers in serious difficulty. It is obvious that the tariff reductions negotiated with the Latin American countries, combined with the support programme for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the programme of Banana Accompanying Measures threaten to seriously jeopardise European producers’ competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="it">Until now, financial support for our banana producers has been provided through the POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) grants, however the latest reform of POSEI back in 2006 does not cater in any way for these latest agreements. I think it is important therefore to ask the Council to consider the need to identify suitable instruments and resources to cover European producers’ financial needs, thus improving their situation and at the same time compensating them for any damage they may suffer as a result of the agreements and the lowering of import duties.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not think it is feasible for us to look for resources to cover European banana producers’ needs on an annual basis. I think we need to find a stable, long-term solution to make up for the damage they have suffered from the expansion and opening-up of the markets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, after many years of dispute between the European Union on the one hand and the Latin American banana producers on the other, an important step has now been taken thanks to the Agreement on Trade in Bananas. I support this agreement because it also puts an end to the dispute at the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the concessions made by the EU and the Latin American banana producers must not cause the general situation of the ACP countries to be forgotten. Assistance for the ACP countries provided by the EU must be carefully monitored and, where necessary, increased. The impact assessment called for by the European Parliament is important in this regard and this must be clearly emphasised. Despite all of the assistance, which is without doubt fundamental and important, there must be no reallocations with the EU budget. All too often, money made available for particular areas is reallocated and used for other purposes. This practice must be stopped, whether, as in the current case, it relates to the European Development Fund or other funds, including the agricultural fund, which is frequently under discussion at the moment. The European Union must remember its responsibilities towards the ACP countries and the outermost regions and be consistent in its actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we now look at this heartening agreement from a global perspective then I have one eye on the Doha negotiations. The World Economic Forum in Davos seems to have provided some impetus. The G20 want to conclude the World Trade Organisation negotiations before 2012. It remains to be seen whether the words will actually be turned into action. However, it seems as though the Agreement on Trade in Bananas has added a piece to the big Doha puzzle.</p>

      <p sl="en">As you can see, it has got a mixed reaction – not surprisingly. There are benefits, particularly for producers who are going to gain by it, but there are also concerns – concerns about the impact on the environment and particularly concerns about the impact on producers in the European Union.</p>

There are many in the European Union who feel that it will discriminate against and decimate the beef industry in the European Union, and particularly in my own country. So we have to be very careful. Yes, extend the hand of friendship, but not at the cost of our own producers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said it in this House and I will say it again today: the outermost regions, and in particular Madeira, my home region, in no way object to the signing of either the Geneva Agreement or the subsequent bilateral agreements. We all recognise not only their importance but also their inevitability. However, we all also know that there are winners and losers in these agreements, and the outermost regions are the clear losers in these agreements in particular, and are damaged by them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What I cannot accept is the insistence on arguing, as the Commission did again today, that the 2006 revision of the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI) provided for this situation and that it has, therefore, already compensated producers for what was at stake here, when we know that what was considered in 2006 was a tariff of EUR 176 per tonne, and what we are now looking at is a tariff of EUR 148, EUR 114 or even EUR 75 per tonne. What we are demanding is compensation measures.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, by opening – or better still, throwing wide open – the doors of the European market to US multinationals, which now control more than 80% of the world trade in bananas, this agreement will have serious consequences that even those who are going to vote for it here are not hiding.</p>
      <p sl="pt">European producers in Portugal, Spain, Greece, Cyprus and France, who in 2008 supplied the European market with almost 600 000 tonnes, will be hit hard. The rapporteur herself admits that the agreement threatens their future existence. In this context, beyond the substance of the report, it is very serious that the Commission, while acknowledging the effects, is not providing for any specific measures to support European producers, specifically through amendments to the regulation and the budget for the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI) adopted in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Producers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, who were neither considered nor present during the debating of this agreement, will also be hit hard by its consequences and the palliative measures announced will not prevent these consequences. Anyone voting for this report must take responsibility for its consequences, and there is no point in coming here to express pious and inconsequential concerns in the shape of questions and requests to the Commission and Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I will try to reply directly to some questions and points which have been raised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, we have spoken here about the resolution of a conflict which can be of help to us in a multilateral agreement. In the case of the bilateral agreements negotiated with the Central American countries and certain Latin American countries, we are talking about a different context, since in this area too, the European Union has had offensive interests and has also obtained things in exchange for what it has offered.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A comment was then made about multinationals and the fact that they are the ones who profit in the ACP countries, and that the financial measures are not sufficient for the ACP countries. Of course, the European Union cannot make decisions in place of the governments of the ACP countries. It believes that a great deal can be done with the envelope that has been made available if the money is used well. Furthermore, I think that this is also the case for the outermost regions, or at least those European Union regions which produce bananas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Mato Adrover and Mr Teixeira, I can show you the figures. When I say that in 2006, in addition to the envelope that was provided for POSEI, we made calculations – and I have the figures here – I mean that we provided a tax reduction, reducing it from EUR 176 to EUR 137 in 2009. We also said that it was possible that, in the Doha negotiations, the results of which were then unknown, those taxes could fall to EUR 79 per tonne. It is for that reason that we added 8.4% to the EUR 245 million provided for the POSEI envelope. This equates to an additional EUR 22 million per year, which is specifically intended for anticipating a possible impact of this kind. It is for this reason that, according to the impact assessment, the budget calculated for POSEI in 2006 was much greater than the actual situation in 2006. I did not say that we would stop there or that we would not take into account a possible additional need for compensation. Let me make myself clear: I am prepared to carry out this analysis. Moreover, if it proves necessary, in the context of the POSEI regulation, which we are now also discussing with the Council and with you, we may contemplate additional compensation. A good part of the compensation needed has, however, already been covered. I am proving it here with figures and with calculations taken from the impact assessments. We have had many discussions with the Member States concerned, and I can tell you that, when I say something, I base it on figures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, what about this money? You have talked a lot about small producers. Indeed, I think that, in these regions, including our outermost regions, we should perhaps give more protection to small producers. For a start, the POSEI money must be used primarily for small producers. This is not always the case, and perhaps at some point, when we discuss POSEI, we will have to consider proceeding with a reform, an adaptation, so that this money really is used to help restructure the sector. However, if this money which has already been allocated to POSEI, together with any compensation, were genuinely used to aid restructuring, then in addition to this compensation, we might also be able to find other solutions for these small producers within a few years. Rest assured that I am very open to seeking new solutions, possibly in the context of POSEI as well, so that this money is put to even better use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to reply to Mr Campbell Bannerman, who has a different opinion, concerning the usefulness of this compensation. I believe that producers in the outermost regions are also European citizens and taxpayers. It seems only right to me that we should support them as far as is justified. With regard to the banana that you showed us, I think that if it had not conformed to the rules that you mention, you would not have been able to buy it. The fact that you were able to buy it means that its size and curvature conform to European standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, I think I have covered the major points. In conclusion, rest assured that, in the POSEI discussions, I am always ready to look at how, based on the figures on the table, existing compensation, or possibly other types of compensation, can respond to these provocations. All in all, however, I think that this is an agreement which, as the rapporteur also said, helps us in many ways and ends a historic dispute.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Mrs Balzani, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having already addressed several questions and concerns. Still, please allow me to mention some myself. Many have expressed concern over what will happen to ACP countries. The proposal for Banana Accompanying Measures has been created for the very reason of assisting and compensating them, and will, as we know, compensate these countries with an annual amount of approximately EUR 190 million for the heavy burdens placed on them by the cessation of the duty-free banana import regime. The other concern raised was about what will happen if we lower duties even further, and continue liberalisation. Now let us not forget that the current topic is the conclusion and strengthening of the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas, and the European Parliament and the Council will still have the opportunity to discuss whether they intend to support additional free trade conventions with Andean countries and Central America later, when, of course, the Commission submits its relevant proposal.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the conclusion of the banana agreement will put an end to a trade debate that has been going on for fifteen years, and this is certainly a welcome development. This outcome will strengthen the EU’s negotiating position in international trade talks, especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations of the World Trade Organisation. I believe that there is a need for us to continuously keep all those concerns and questions you have voiced here in relation to solidarity – concerns which pertain exactly to the poorest countries – on the agenda, and to look for joint solutions, but to give a green light to this banana trade agreement and the law repealing the previous agreement. I therefore ask the European Parliament to decide on expressing its consent to the banana trade agreement tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate has been very interesting and has partly restated some of the anxieties and issues which we have already looked at in the Committee on International Trade.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to re-emphasise an important fact that I think we lose sight of every now and then. These agreements represent the implementation of a specific commitment made by the European Union, in its role as a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We must not forget this. Through these agreements, the EU is undertaking to resolve a serious problem with important countries, which it is having to sort out because it has breached the principle of non-discrimination. These are therefore agreements that restore our credibility and proper position as members of the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="it">This agreement follows on therefore from disputes and tensions, amid a climate that will certainly have been damaging for other areas of our relationships. As a definitive settlement agreement it is trying and succeeding to create a new balance, with particular attention, as we have said and have also stated in the resolution, to countries in fragile states of development.</p>
      <p sl="it">The accompanying measures will now certainly be monitored, and to my mind this is the most important point. It is important to have established the accompanying measures, but it will be even more important to have the evaluations of their impact and to have the commitment, which I am delighted to have heard today from the Council and the Commission, to keep constant track of the situation as it develops and above all the willingness to assist with further measures if they should prove to be necessary.</p>
      <p sl="it">POSEI (Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity) itself has been incorporated into the resolution as a sensitive point that must be monitored due to the delicate balance between the financial contributions made under POSEI and the new situation regarding the outermost regions. Therefore the impact of the agreements on the outermost EU regions where bananas are produced will also be monitored and watched carefully.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council also mentioned the need to work on transparency in the agri-food chain, which I am happy about, as it is an important point. We have been talking about producers the whole time, but there is also the major issue of banana distribution within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are many things that must be done going forward, therefore. We need to monitor the effects of the agreements, the implementation of the accompanying measures and the suitability of POSEI to protect Europe’s producers. We also need to use other instruments such as transparency in the agri-food chain and hence widen the scope of examination to take in the distribution chain as well, which has a major impact on the final cost of the fruit. We need to look at consumer protection, which is something that deserves our attention as much as all the other interests involved in this business. However, all these things, not least consumer protection, must start with the current situation and establishing the outcome of these disputes in which the EU has had to make concessions to the United States and the Latin American countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope therefore that these agreements will be adopted, because I believe they form an essential basis for making the instruments linked to the delicate balance of the banana market work and can guarantee clear practices that will benefit other interests also, such as consumer protection, which is linked to transparency in the agri-food chain. These will in turn bring improvements to the banana market and to our European producers, which are impossible without a sound basis such as that provided by finalising these disputes within the WTO, to which the European Union belongs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The conclusion of these agreements has made it possible to bring an end to one of the most complex and longest=running disputes against the EU in the World Trade Organisation. It should be mentioned that, throughout the negotiation process, we warned the Commission of the need to take care of: - the interests and specificities of banana producers in the outermost regions, notably by increasing funding under the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), as producers’ incomes and the marketing of their produce could be compromised by the pressures created by strengthening the increasing liberalisation of the global banana trade; - the interests and specificities of banana producers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. I therefore consider the conclusions of the rapporteur’s recommendation – according to which the outermost regions’ interests should also be considered – to be a contribution of great relevance, in that Parliament should consent to the agreements if the Commission and Council: present to Parliament, as soon as possible, an impact assessment on the consequences of the agreements for banana-producing developing countries and for the outermost regions; implement specific measures aimed at strengthening banana producers’ commercial position, and adopt measures to finance a programme in favour of banana-producing ACP countries.</p>

      <p sl="ro">On 15 December 2009, the European Union, the United States and a group of Latin American countries signed the agreement on the EU’s tariffs for the banana trade. This agreement brought to a close a complicated dispute, lasting almost two decades. It shows the EU’s commitment in this area and will be included in the final results of the Doha Round negotiations. Unfortunately, we are unable to savour fully this success. The approved reduction in tariffs for Latin American banana exports is likely to have an adverse economic and social impact on the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries whose producers do not have the same technical facilities as their competitors. This is why I welcome the financial aid programme included in the agreement, whereby ACP countries will receive EUR 190 million up until 2013 as support aimed at encouraging competitiveness and the diversification of their production. However, the European Commission must present an impact assessment of the agreement by 2020, as well as of the aid programme, along with any recommendations for extending it and providing additional financial aid.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is excellent that the EU has reached an agreement with the countries of Latin America and the United States over the banana dispute, which has been an emotional issue for a long time. It is better to come to an agreement than to continue rowing within the context of the World Trade Organisation. It has been claimed that the agreement and tariff reductions would favour large banana producing countries and multinational companies. It is nevertheless important to realise that in the future the interests of poor ACP countries will continue to be better compared to the countries of Latin America. Furthermore, the EU is also utilising a huge aid package to help the ACP countries diversify their economies to make them less dependent on the export of bananas. It remains to be seen whether the agreement reached now will have an effect on consumer prices in Europe. Whatever the case, the agreement is a historic one, because it shows that the EU is capable of demonstrating internal consistency and taking decisions even in awkward situations and amid tough negotiations. I will be voting in favour of the agreement.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Geneva Agreement on trade in bananas represents an opportunity for the emerging economies of Latin America, but it also gives rise to new competition between banana producers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, the economic development of which essentially relies on the exploitation of their natural resources. We must therefore take care that this new competition is fair. I am also concerned about the bilateral agreements with the EU negotiated by Peru and Colombia so that they may enjoy a preferential rate of customs duty that is lower than that provided in the Geneva Agreement. In these circumstances, I consider that it is now a matter of urgency to implement the Banana Accompanying Measures contained in that agreement, which will enable the ACP countries to modernise this sector and to cope with global competition. I therefore call upon the Council to declare without delay its position on Parliament’s new proposal, so that the ACP countries may benefit from the measures announced for 2010, and I ask the Commission to ensure that the social and environmental requirements are reciprocally respected by producers and exporters outside the ACP. In my opinion, this is essential if all producers are to be put on an equal footing, which is far from the case today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The banana agreement concluded by the EU at the WTO in December 2009, which we are ratifying today, must be accompanied by support mechanisms for our producers. The reduction by the EU of tariffs on bananas imported from Latin America will put several European regions, such as the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique, Greece, Portugal and the Spanish Canary Islands in difficulty, as they will have to cope with the opening-up of the market. That is why we will have to monitor the real impact of the financial aid, which is intended to support investment and economic diversification policies, and to strengthen the social and environmental impact. This impact assessment must tell us whether this aid is sufficient to counterbalance the new international situation in the banana market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am happy to be able to lend my support to a pan-European project that is very ambitious both for the European Union and for developing countries, and which is aimed at eliminating tuberculosis by means of a vaccination programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us remember that more than 1.7 million people died from tuberculosis in 2009. The cost in terms of human life is some 4 700 people per day. Add to this the annual economic losses, which are estimated at more than USD 50 billion for Africa alone. If, based on this, we were to reduce tuberculosis to a problem typical of developing countries, we should be greatly deceiving ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, the cases reported in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the summer of 2010 remind us that the disease is here in our countries, not to mention the ravages caused by the same disease in the east of our continent, particularly in Russia and Moldova. The Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI) is an initiative that aims to create effective vaccines with a view to protect developing countries at an affordable price. With this in mind, I should like, if I may, to make the following comments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, health does not have a price but it has a cost. While access to healthcare must be universal, the ability to pay remains in itself limited to the industrialised nations. That being the case, it is important to spread the costs broadly. Clearly, patients in the North, that is to say in the industrialised countries, must pay a high price, otherwise the sources of funding for research will dry up quickly enough. However, given that the financial contribution of the countries of the South is, if not non-existent, then no more than purely symbolic, our solidarity becomes indispensable to overcome this shortfall.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second, the TBVI initiative also has a place in the EU’s 2020 strategy. It is a perfect illustration of what we can achieve if we can establish our health priorities in good time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third, and concluding, comment is this: that this in no way excludes additional or complementary funding from the large institutional lenders, including the World Bank in particular. Other countries, such as the United States, Canada or a number of emerging countries that are affected by the problem of tuberculosis, whether directly, as it impacts on their populations, or indirectly in the context of international solidarity, should quite logically make their own contribution to this initiative too. To be specific, I am talking here about the public-private partnership model.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This new approach can be beneficial provided that solidarity is limited to those who have both medical and financial requirements. The alternative would be to protect only well-off populations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In 2008, the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI) was established in the form of a public-private partnership with the support of the Health Cooperation Programme within the Seventh Framework Programme for research in order to mobilise additional resources for this important area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the present time, the majority of recently developed new vaccine candidates are still in the preclinical development phase or beginning clinical development. A crucial point to emphasise is the fact that we do not have available clinical data to support the idea that one of the vaccine candidates under development could prove to be more effective than the vaccine currently in use, which is the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to come onto the market, new vaccine candidates must be capable of being more effective than BCG or of replacing it as a better vaccine. The fact is that we still do not have these important data available. The TBVI should not be considered in isolation from other initiatives for supporting clinical trials.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to deal with bottlenecks in the clinical development field, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, or EDCTP, has been established as the first initiative taken under Article 185, in which 14 Member States, 2 Associated States and the Commission have collectively committed EUR 400 million, with EUR 200 million coming from the European Union, with the aim of promoting research in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials for AIDS, for example, malaria and tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa. The programme is predicted to complete all the trials currently under way, including eight trials of the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, by 2015. This alternative is therefore already in place, and it works. The Commission is also very interested in what is called ‘the business model’, which has been developed by the public-private partnerships, including the one presented by the TBVI.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The TBVI has, moreover, proposed a model that can potentially become a useful tool in the future. However, this requires an in-depth analysis of the commercial project as well as a risk assessment. Consequently, even if the TBVI enjoys significant financial support, its success is not guaranteed, precisely because of the fact that there is not enough information to indicate whether what is currently being trialled can yield results subsequently.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the Commission will continue these internal discussions and will also analyse the model with the financial institutions, thus contributing to the development of a concept so that it can form part of the practical implementation of EU 2020. From this point of view, then, this possibility could be examined.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, the incidence of tuberculosis worldwide remains a cause of great concern, despite the progress made. The increasing resistance of this disease and insufficient scientific research mean that today almost 2 million people die of it every year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We welcome EU initiatives to combat tuberculosis through this resolution, but we call for more scientific research to be undertaken to develop new forms of vaccine against this disease. Vaccines are the public-health measure that is most effective at protecting Europeans from infectious diseases, but it is also important for healthcare to reach developing countries, so as to contribute to increasing life expectancy and combating poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As I said, there has been some progress and we are on the right track, but the EU must redouble its efforts, and call for more coordinated action and integration of European research into combating poverty-related diseases. That is the only way that we will manage to alleviate the tragic situation being experienced in several developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to ask the Commission how it intends to follow up on scientific research efforts in this area, to intensify these efforts, and to translate the results of this research into benefits for people in the light of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is always good to see you in the chair when we are discussing issues about the plights of others. I know you share our concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to associate myself with the words of Mr Goerens and, indeed, take the Commission a little further. It is quite right that TB is a significant global health concern and, as we know, is the second leading cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide. As we heard, 1.6 million to 2 million people die annually from the disease. EU funding has been instrumental in generating a robust pipeline of innovative TB vaccine candidates, as the Commission said enabling their early stage development by phase 1 and phase 2A clinical trials.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately – and this is the problem – currently funding mechanisms, including the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, allocate very limited funding to the very costly late-stage clinical trials – phase 2B and phase 3 – which are vital to demonstrate vaccine safety. We have vaccines, but it is vital to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy necessary for licensure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I now welcome the fact that the Commission has said that it is bringing in additional funding, but will the rules for any new EDCTP budget provisions permit funding to be directed to the development and building of clinical trial sites, including epidemiology studies? Is the Commission considering the introduction of competitive funding mechanisms for the late-stage clinical development of innovative new vaccines that address the neglected diseases, such as TB?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, tuberculosis is still very widespread today, particularly in poorer countries. A third of the world’s population is infected and 2.5 million people die from TB each year. According to estimates by the World Health Organisation, there are 49 new cases and seven deaths per hour in Europe alone. In the industrialised nations, tuberculosis has experienced a resurgence, particularly as a secondary disease in patients with HIV and AIDS, but also as a result of migration and tourism.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prevention, diagnosis and treatment can indeed bring the spread of this disease under control. Humans are the only host of the tuberculosis microbacterium and its eradication would be perfectly possible. However, there are concerns about the increasing number of resistant bacteria. There are new vaccinations and, according to one study, administration of vitamin D reduces the treatment time for tuberculosis.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, four years before the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the number of new cases of tuberculosis being diagnosed throughout the world is still alarming. Tuberculosis is a treatable disease. In developing countries, unfortunately, and in particular in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, it remains a very serious problem. According to recent estimates, around two billion people are infected with the tubercle bacillus, or in other words one third of the world’s population. Statistically speaking, one in ten of these individuals will go on to develop tuberculosis. The poorest regions of the world are at particular risk of an increase in new cases of tuberculosis, since poor nutrition and living conditions, as well as stress, create a favourable environment for development of the disease. Access to effective treatment for the disease is limited in many countries, and there is no coordination of treatment for AIDS and that for tuberculosis. This is a result of the fact that the governments of developing countries do not spend enough on health. In addition, healthcare systems in rural areas suffer from staffing shortages, and lack the means to treat such diseases. In countries with limited financial possibilities, the effects are therefore felt most severely in rural areas. Developed countries spend around 5% of GDP on public healthcare, whereas developing countries spend one half of this figure. It is therefore impossible for poorer countries to increase spending on health without external assistance, as was also noted by Mr Goerens. On top of this, tuberculosis is not only a medical problem, but also a social and economic problem, since it causes productivity to drop and has economic ramifications. All this means that we should be decisive in our response, and we really should make every effort to ensure that vaccines become more widely available.</p>

In the Millennium Declaration we committed, first of all, to reducing child mortality; secondly, to improving maternal health; and thirdly to combating AIDS, malaria and many other diseases, including tuberculosis.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nonetheless, all of us here today know that it is those goals that are currently the furthest behind schedule. We must take measures: we must increase funding for health programmes in developing countries. Access to free healthcare systems should be the European Union’s ultimate goal in this area.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that support should be given to global initiatives such as vertical funds to aid in the struggle against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. However, Commissioner, it is also necessary to support countries politically and economically, so that they can develop effective healthcare systems. I am convinced that this would be the best way of ensuring the principle of appropriation and allowing the most vulnerable parts of the population access to healthcare.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, tuberculosis, like malaria and AIDS, is one of the great pandemics which are decimating the populations of developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. This directly results in a deteriorating economic and social situation in these countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, European countries have also failed to cope with the high incidence of tuberculosis. This disease cannot be considered simply as a medical-pharmaceutical problem, or just as a problem of human behaviour. It also involves issues of human development and integrity, and also justice, which require a global approach. People who are ill with tuberculosis in developing countries are also victims of injustice, for the treatment they receive is insufficient and not of the same quality as in the developed world.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We need further research, and a continuous flow of new medicines and vaccines capable of responding to new complications and resistant strains of various pathogens. I would like to draw your attention, however, to those simple heroes who are fighting tuberculosis, enabling us to continue treating the sick, to resist the hardships created by combined infections of tuberculosis and AIDS, and to help all countries meet the millennium challenges. We must support health workers in developing countries. Health workers are leaving for more affluent countries because health budgets are being slashed in their own countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I support the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, but we must take a global approach to overcoming this disease. It is not enough just to support research and the pharmaceutical industry, because, apart from anything else, it will be a long time before this research bears fruit.</p>

As the Commission has just stated, however, we do not yet have these new vaccines, of course, as we are still in the pre-clinical stages, and we are still just testing their effectiveness when given to humans.

Development cooperation and aid policy plays a crucial role here, which, naturally, must involve aid to vaccination programmes; however, more is needed.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the number of tuberculosis cases and resultant deaths in Hungary has increased at a frightening rate over the past years. This is the result of nation-destroying liberal thinking, among other things. Here I am referring to the shameful Hungarian Healthcare Act of 2006, which was based on hospital closures and profit-oriented healthcare services. A significant factor in the development of the disease is poverty, including the increased number of homeless people and a healthcare system that is increasingly difficult to access. I believe that it is important to reinforce the healing and preventive role of healthcare, extend screenings, and not only extend improved vaccination but also make it available to everyone. These steps could result in a healthier nation, and a healthier Europe and society in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I shall try to provide some answers to the points raised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, we must intensify research, as I already said in my introduction. The Commission is looking at ways in which to increase the funding for its tuberculosis programmes, and one solution could be to top up the EDCTP programme, which I spoke to you about. The programme currently operates with EUR 400 million, of which the Commission provides EUR 200 million. The Commission is also considering the possibility of creating an EDCTP 2 programme, for example. I must also stress, as I have already said to Mr Tănăsescu, that the Commission already dedicates a substantial amount of resources to the tuberculosis research programme. I can even cite you a figure: EUR 65 million have already been allocated to this programme. However, it is clear that this is not enough, and the public-private partnership must also be examined.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, if it comes down to a question of funding vaccine candidates in a clinical phase, the issue of effectiveness will have to be considered. As I told you, the information that we currently have gives us no assurance that significant funding could lead to a positive result. Vitamins are another approach currently being studied, but what we must avoid is the development of resistance. That is perhaps one avenue to be explored, but we must bear in mind the existence of that risk.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us now speak more generally about health systems in the European Union, as well as in the developing countries. In the European Union, health is, besides, also one of the objectives that the Commission is trying to promote in the Member States, by means of various programmes, including the Europe 2020 Agenda. In other words, it is promoting investment in health. Within the field of research, in one of the research and innovation initiatives, the Commission – and a group of Commissioners in particular – is working on this topic so as to ensure that innovation can be boosted in the Member States to intensify health-related research, in parallel with issues concerning the ageing of the population.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as developing countries are concerned, the European Union is already achieving a great deal in the area of health with the development fund, and this is a topic to which the Commission will continue to pay full attention in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that I have been able, on behalf of the Commission, to provide some answers to your questions. I can only assure you that research remains one of the Commission’s main concerns.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As a member of the delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I am in favour of the results of EU research into the development of vaccines against tuberculosis being made available to developing countries, and of helping these countries to fund treatment for those suffering from the disease. Tuberculosis is one of the three most frequently occurring infectious diseases, along with HIV and malaria. One third of the world’s population is infected with the tubercle bacillus; every year, eight million people are diagnosed with the disease and it kills between 2.6 and 2.9 million. Over 95% of cases occur in developing countries. Every second, the tubercle bacillus claims another victim. Around 10% of those infected will go on to develop the disease, which can be deadly if left untreated. Most cases are diagnosed in India, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Ethiopia. In Asia and Africa, incidence stands at 100-120 per 100 000 of population. Access to effective treatment is limited in many countries. Tuberculosis is a serious economic problem. The global fall in workforce productivity caused by the disease amounts to USD 13 billion every year. Eliminating tuberculosis is one of the Millennium Development Goals, which the EU wants to achieve by 2015. We already only have four years left. Tuberculosis is currently a fully treatable disease. We need comprehensive programmes aimed both at preventing and treating tuberculosis. An information campaign on tuberculosis and ways of avoiding and treating it should be launched as soon as possible, and a vaccination programme started.</p>

      <p sl="en">in writing. – Throughout the history of mankind, tuberculosis has killed more people than any other disease. This highly contagious, airborne bacterium can infect ten to fifteen other people before the symptoms are noticed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overcrowded housing, slumification and the lack of proper hygiene have always been a serious risk factor for tuberculosis, and therefore TB is the disease most strongly related to and partly caused by poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the efforts of the WHO and national authorities, the number of people dying of tuberculosis amounts to 1.5 million every year and the number is still increasing. I full-heartedly support the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative and sincerely hope that it can provide more vaccines for sufferers in Europe and around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it must be emphasised that the fight against TB must walk hand in hand with the fight against poverty and social exclusion. It is necessary to identify the vulnerable groups as well as to determine and eliminate the barriers preventing these groups from accessing the full range of TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</p>

      <p sl="lt">We must combat tuberculosis, because this disease kills nearly two million people worldwide each year, and almost a third of the world’s population is infected by it. I would like to draw attention to the fact that tuberculosis is a sensitive world health issue and the second greatest cause of death among infectious diseases worldwide. Tuberculosis is heavily linked to social and economic problems, such as poverty, unemployment, alcoholism, drug addiction and HIV/AIDS, as well as the inadequate and poor state of healthcare systems in poor countries and delays in diagnosis. I am therefore pleased that the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative model has been drawn up, because all patients suffering from tuberculosis worldwide will be able to benefit from the results of research and work activities. Furthermore, this project would contribute towards implementing the Europe 2020 objectives and achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. I would like to point out that there is insufficient funding for the fight against tuberculosis and European Union funding is very important for establishing a strong package of new potential tuberculosis vaccines. I hope that progress will be made as soon as possible to licence current potential European tuberculosis vaccines, and that they will be available to those who most need them. Furthermore, it is important to find opportunities to implement competitive funding mechanisms to carry out the final stages of clinical research into new vaccines against tuberculosis.</p>

The statistics tell us that one third of the world’s population is infected with the tubercle bacillus. This problem is a cause for concern. We must ensure that only the best and most innovative vaccines are used as the fundamental tools in the fight against the disease. We must try to step up international measures and consider the funding of vaccines, particularly for developing countries.

      <p sl="pl">I am concerned at the conclusions reached by the authors of the oral question; five years before the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, there has been a slight decrease in the global incidence of tuberculosis. According to the information at my disposal, over 73% of doctors in Central and Eastern Europe admit that they do not feel adequately trained to diagnose and treat tuberculosis. The general feeling among doctors is that the situation is significantly worse; 75% of doctors believe that the number of new cases of tuberculosis is growing. What can be the reason for such a discrepancy between the official statistics and the observations of medical practitioners? The system for collecting data on new cases of tuberculosis is outdated, and healthcare institutions often neglect their duties in this respect. It should be stressed that the key weapons in fighting the disease remain prevention, education and adherence to the rules of hygiene, which makes it possible to avoid infection with the tubercle bacillus. I agree with the authors of the question that one of the solutions to this problem may be the introduction of a vaccination programme at the same time as a large-scale information campaign.</p>

      <p sl="ro">It is Europe’s duty to look for viable, innovative methods to guarantee the funding for research in order to combat tuberculosis and other transmissible diseases. The Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI), an organisation supported by the European Union, offers a solution to the current situation by creating accessible vaccines at affordable prices, which can be supplied to the population through a structured vaccination programme. The inclusion of the TBVI in the EU 2020 strategy may be the solution enabling Europe to strengthen its strategic independence in the battle against tuberculosis and its position as a leading innovator.</p>

The arrest of a prominent member of the opposition, Constantin Nicolescu, an arrest announced prior to the start of the judicial hearing and without any hard evidence, demonstrates the undemocratic way in which the current government is acting. The arrest carried out by political order, along with the contempt shown to ordinary citizens through the antisocial measures adopted by the government, is bringing out onto the streets the people who have been demeaned and condemned to poverty. With the aim of quelling the discontent against abusive, antidemocratic measures, the government has arranged the purchase of anti-riot equipment, amounting to EUR 10 million.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, we have heard many complaining and indignant voices raised in connection with the Hungarian Presidency. It is interesting that none of these pertained to the EU programme of the Presidency-in-Office. There were some who raised their voices in connection with the media law. The European Commission has already formulated its objections, and the Hungarian Government has shown willingness to amend the law.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The question occurred to me why there has not been the same international interest in the state language law that is in effect in Slovakia to this day, which continues to impose fines for the use of one’s mother tongue. Why did the voices raised in alarm over the assertion of fundamental rights in connection with the media law not show concern when one of the most natural human rights of the Hungarian minority of Slovakia was called into question? Others were disturbed by the giant carpet laid out in the Council building, on which a map of Hungary from 160 years ago is depicted. This map represents that we can only build a strong Europe through knowledge of, and respect for, our common history and national values.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, 14 February, St Valentine’s Day, will mark the first ever European Epilepsy Day. St Valentine himself is reputed to have been a sufferer from epilepsy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently six million Europeans suffer from epilepsy. In Scotland this is around 39 000 people, yet just 20 000 Scots have been diagnosed and control their condition with medication. This means that 19 000 people live on a daily basis with the fear of a recurring seizure. Extrapolated across the EU this means millions of people also live with this fear.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 14 February we must raise awareness of epilepsy. We must also try to get those who have the condition properly diagnosed and call on Member States to have more neurologists who have a specialism in epilepsy. On 15 February there will be a number of events in Parliament and I encourage colleagues to take part. Many of your constituents will be present.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome Joanne Hill, a specialist nurse in epilepsy, and Fiona Nicholson, the service manager of a Scottish epilepsy centre.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to dedicate the time allotted to me to the case of the Székely people. In the past few days, the President of Romania has unfortunately stated once again that he does not support Székely territorial autonomy. I would welcome it if we could once and for all make things clear here in the European Parliament, and pronounce that the Székely people are entitled to territorial autonomy. This is not a question of the goodwill of Traian Băsescu; the Székely people do have the right to autonomy. I would like to remind everyone that autonomy is an internationally recognised, binding right, and the double standard applied by the European Union when it says that some ethnicities have the right to autonomy while others do not is unacceptable. Basques and Catalans are entitled to autonomy while the Székely are not. On account of this logic, I must say with absolute conviction that those who do not support the Székely people’s efforts for autonomy are not Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I wish to point out that freedom is one of the fundamental purposes of the European Community: freedom to travel, freedom to trade and freedom to work. We do not have freedom to work because we do not have mutual recognition of qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Today I heard about a physician who worked in Italy who took nine months to get permission to work in Ireland. There is no sense whatever in that. We should look at the UPMC system in the United States; it is a useful example for us. In particular, if we aim to have medical e-services, we must establish this recognition of qualifications. Otherwise, we can not make progress.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the recurring abuse of power by those governing Romania at the moment has plunged the country into the darkest period of its history since 1989. Although Romania has a democratic constitution, its articles are often blatantly flouted. Although, in theory, there is a separation of powers of state, in accordance with democratic principles, in practical terms, one man, President Traian Băsescu, controls all the power in Romania, dictating his orders willy-nilly and abusing power on a daily basis, all in an attempt to destroy the political opposition and stifle any voice which speaks out to offer a viable alternative to the catastrophic Băsescu-Boc administration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As a European Union Member State, Romania’s fate should not be treated with indifference by either the EU institutions or the representatives of the other EU Member States, who should take a stance on this issue. Please do not let yourselves be taken in by the incoherent explanations and sometimes embarrassing excuses offered by those governing Romania or those openly supporting them, whether out of fear or looking out for their own petty interests. Their actions suffice to show those who want to see what the sad reality is in my country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I have decided that I will regularly remind Mr Buzek about how democracy is progressing in Romania. He has been in the Romanian Parliament and supported the Boc government and Traian Băsescu. I want to tell Mr Buzek that the Romanian Parliament does not have any power and all the laws are adopted and enforced by the government. The Romanian Government does not have any power either because it is Traian Băsescu who appoints ministers, dresses them down and makes announcements any time important measures are taken. In Romania innocent people are also thrown into jail for 30 days, after which they have to stand trial.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I asked Mr Buzek for an official position and I received a reply via a press release from the PD-L party and Traian Băsescu. I urge and await an official position from Mr Buzek.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, why, in your opinion, does the European Parliament pass resolutions? Precisely so that they may be implemented. However, it appears that the Latvian government has no intention of implementing the resolution of 11 March 2004. That resolution clearly states that the right to vote in local elections must be granted to people who are permanently resident on Latvian territory. To the question of when Latvia will implement this resolution, we shall possibly receive the answer: ‘Kad pūcei aste ziedēs’ (in Latvian). In Russian, one would say: ‘Kogda rak na gore svistnet’, and in English: ‘When pigs fly’. It comes down to this – either pigs will start to fly or we must collectively put an end to discrimination against 335 000 people living in Latvia.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we are witnessing today events which will change the course of history in North Africa and elsewhere. Dictatorial regimes cannot stand firm for long anywhere in the world. However, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that new forms of dictatorship can appear, even in a Member State of the European Union regarded as being democratic, namely, Romania. Under the rule of law a person must be considered innocent until convicted by judges, and must stand trial as a free citizen, unless he poses a danger to society.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These universal principles of law are no longer valid in Romania when it comes to President Băsescu and the Liberal Democratic Party in power. Clear proof that arrests are being made in Romania by political order is provided by the statement made by President Băsescu in Strasbourg five hours prior to the arrest of Constantin Nicolescu, and I quote: ‘An important member of the Opposition has been arrested’, end of quote, even though the latter had not yet reached the court. What clearer evidence is needed to show that President Băsescu decides who will be arrested and when?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I too share the sentiments of my colleagues who have drawn attention to the persecution of the political opposition in Romania, using the legal instruments of a government showing ever-growing evidence of authoritarian abuses. With its popularity rating in free fall and in the wake of a set of austerity measures of brutal severity, having a drastic impact on living standards, the Romanian Government is resorting to increasingly violent antidemocratic methods to hold on to power.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As my colleagues have said, the unjustified and harsh arrest of a prominent member of the opposition, elected directly by the citizens, is the most recent and worrying example in a series of threats and acts of harassment against opposition groups. At the same time, the state budget is being plundered by the government’s political supporters whose chaotic measures are deepening the economic and social crisis and increasing social tension to an alarming extent. This is why we are also protesting together against the attacks which are being carried out in an attempt to intimidate opposition politicians and trade unions. I believe that EU forums must take a stance against the blatant violations of democratic rights in Romania.</p>

A great social and economic pact has recently been signed between the government, union leaders and business leaders in Spain. This agreement establishes Spain as a country capable of joining forces to overcome its difficulties, face up to its challenges and reinforce the welfare state. Ladies and gentlemen, in this global crisis, this agreement is a unique example of how, by society as a whole taking responsibility, we are making agreements with the idea of winning the future and building a strong Spain in a Union that plays an increasingly important role.</p>
