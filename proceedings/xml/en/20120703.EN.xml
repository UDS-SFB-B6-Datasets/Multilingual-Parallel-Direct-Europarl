      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the Council and Commission statements on the review of the Danish Presidency. In that connection, I would like to offer a warm welcome to the former President-in-Office of the Council, the Prime Minister of Denmark, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. I am also pleased to see the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, here this morning.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, President of the Commission, distinguished leaders of the political groups, Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Commission, it is a privilege and a great honour to address this Parliament again. When I last stood here, back in January, I ended my speech by saying that the economic crisis had put the European Union to the test. That was when we took over the Presidency at a time of unprecedented crisis in the history of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The gravity of the situation, the depth of the challenge, the severity of the predicament facing our Union could not, and should not, be underestimated, and I said this right at the beginning of our Presidency – not to lower the expectations for the Danish Presidency, but rather to make clear exactly what is at stake as the EU tries to work its way out of this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the past month, the EU has been forced to take critical decisions which will lay the foundation for the Europe of tomorrow, of next year and of decades to come. This is no easy task in a Union as vast, diverse and complex as ours, but leaders throughout Europe must never lose sight of the core of the problem facing the EU today: that our very economic foundation, our future prosperity, the hopes and dreams and aspirations of our children are at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">The storm has not passed yet and we are still facing a number of different and intertwined challenges. So I am reminded at this time of the inspirational words of the first Chancellor of West Germany, Konrad Adenauer, who once said: ‘The unity of Europe was the dream of a few. It became the hope of many. Today, it has become a necessity for all of us’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those words have perhaps never been as true as they are today. The EU is a necessity to all of us. As representatives of the European institutions, we have and we feel an obligation to find the solutions which will bring our Union forward, and we know that we owe that to our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I stood here in January, I proudly stated that I am a European at heart, and the past six months have only reassured me in my belief in the European project. I believe in our institutions, our cooperation and our common responsibility. If we seek to ensure solidarity, growth and prosperity, we must seek it together through common solutions to common problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">And that is what our Presidency has been all about: ensuring solidarity, growth and prosperity together. We took upon ourselves the task of proving that the EU still works and is still capable of delivering necessary results for our citizens, and we did this inspired by someone that we all know. In 1950 he said: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’. Of course, it was Robert Schuman who said this, and the subsequent history of European integration has proved him absolutely right.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is an unequivocal truth in Schuman’s words. Our Union is built from its very foundation with bricks made of solidarity. Some stones have been small, some have been enormous but, brick by brick, we have strengthened our cooperation and solidarity with one another. This is to me the essence of our Union: and this is what we have tried to do – to work inch by inch in creating results.</p>
      <p sl="en">Jobs and growth, financial responsibility, a greener economy and a safe Europe: these have been the priorities of the Danish Presidency. But priorities without tangible results are just empty words, and I believe that Europe has, in fact, delivered over the past months. The Compact for Growth and Jobs adopted last week in the European Council is the perfect completion of our Presidency. The Compact does not solve all Europe’s problems but it is a light in the dark for the many European citizens feeling the harsh effects of the economic crisis. For those outside the labour market, for those without opportunities, for those facing poor prospects, including not least our young generations, we are presenting a way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a result of our persistent efforts to promote growth and new jobs in Europe but, of course, our work does not end here. We must be vigilant in transforming this Compact from a piece of paper into practical reality. We must find a way to ensure that together – Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament – we roll out the measures contained in the Compact.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a situation in which, for the first time in the history of the European Union, we cannot assume that the coming generations will enjoy more prosperity and better opportunities than we have enjoyed. That, of course, leaves us with a huge responsibility for the conditions of our citizens and businesses, which has been a top priority for our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me highlight a few of the main results reached during our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the headline of ‘a more dynamic Europe’, the Danish Presidency has pushed for robust EU measures in areas such as research and education, infrastructure and the single market, and we have done this to boost growth and to kick-start a job-rich recovery. I am particularly pleased that we have succeeded in achieving a historic compromise in the European Council on the patent reform, after more than 30 years of negotiations. This could mean drastic cost savings for businesses across Europe: savings that can be used to promote new jobs. We may not see eye to eye on all elements of this compromise, but I truly hope that we can work as colegislators to see the patent reform become a reality to benefit our companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also very pleased that we have adopted the Roaming Regulation. This regulation will lower prices significantly for cellphone users in Member States and will reduce costs to and the burden on companies. In short, it can contribute to growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important result is the regulation on the European system of standardisation. The agreement reached here will modernise the single market. Furthermore, we have reached agreement on the proposal on venture capital and social entrepreneurship funds. This will boost access to funding for European businesses and social entrepreneurs. Of course, this is also an important step in trying to create growth in the EU. We know that the single market has been one of the greatest achievements of the EU and, in order to realise its full potential, we must continue to reform and modernise it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second main objective of our Presidency was to ensure a more responsible Europe. The need for fiscal consolidation and greater budget discipline is crucial if we want to safeguard against the financial crisis of tomorrow. We have also taken important steps in this field during the Danish Presidency. The Council agreement on the ‘two-pack’ will enable stronger European monitoring of budgetary plans being drafted by members of the eurozone. Stronger common rules will reinforce the vigilance of Member States in avoiding large imbalances and unsustainable debt levels. We have come far, and I urge a rapid agreement between the Council and Parliament during the Cypriot Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">A similar important step is the directive on capital requirements, on which the Council agreed its position last month. This directive will help minimise the cost and the risk of a financial crisis hitting us again as it did in 2008. Furthermore, we have worked for a stronger commitment by Member States to implement structural reforms. The completion of the first full round of the European Semester is a decisive step towards a more responsible Europe. All these results will help to increase confidence in Europe’s financial system, and I am in no doubt that these surveillance measures will lead to greater political accountability and stronger budget discipline.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we have been working hard to streamline the next EU budget so that it helps to create growth in the Union, and we took an important step last week in the European Council. Here too, I would very much like to thank Parliament for its constructive cooperation throughout.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is our firm conviction that we need to direct more funds towards growth-enhancing areas such as research, education, energy efficiency and green technology. That has to be the way forward for the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘Measures that will inspire growth and stronger job creation’ has been the mantra for the Danish Presidency throughout these six months, and I am pleased to note that the European Council placed strong emphasis on this last week. As you also know, the transition to a green economy has been among the most important political priorities for the Danish Presidency, and I warmly welcome the common agreement reached on the Energy Efficiency Directive. This was a landmark result which required a good deal of flexibility, patience and hard work on both sides, and I would like to thank everyone here who was involved in reaching this significant milestone. Without you, we could not have done it.</p>
      <p sl="en">This directive is of key importance in our efforts to achieve our two inter-related goals, of transforming Europe into a competitive, low-carbon economy and increasing our energy security, all at once. In addition, the directive will create up to hundreds of thousands of new jobs in Europe and it will, of course, ensure that the EU gets much closer to our target of 20% energy savings by 2020. I consider this an excellent result.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline my appreciation of the dedication, high level of ambition, and willingness to compromise demonstrated by the European Parliament on this road to the green transition. Your continued engagement in making our economy greener will be ever more needed in the years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">Underpinning our aspiration for a dynamic, responsible and greener Europe is the need to ensure a safe Europe. Denmark’s Presidency has achieved a wide range of tangible results in this field. We have granted candidate status to Serbia and are opening accession negotiations with Montenegro, which will influence the regional dynamics and contribute to stabilising the Western Balkans. We have also reached agreement on essential elements of the asylum package, which will help ensure efficiency, legal rights and more uniform asylum procedures in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Together with Parliament and the Commission, we have managed to conclude a lot of important business. And today I am pleased to say that we were able to reach important agreements only thanks to constructive cooperation with you – the Parliament, with the Commission and, of course, with the Member States in the Council. As I see it, the achievements of the Danish Presidency are also the achievements of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all play our part in realising the huge potential of the Community method. Having different responsibilities, playing different roles and, on some occasions, defending diverging interests, the Council and Parliament will not always share the same view. The heated debate on the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism was, indeed, a case in point, but I drew great encouragement from the fact that our negotiations over the past six months have been characterised by flexibility, a willingness to find common ground and, most importantly perhaps, a strong commitment to deliver on the needs and demands of the citizens. The relentless focus on results, stone by stone, brick by brick, represents the spirit of our cooperation within the EU. At the end of the day, as we strive to put Europe on a path for future growth and prosperity, we have to be guided by our vision for the society that we want to create. For me, this is what sets the Union apart and what makes our social model so unique.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what I believe in. That is what has made our economies so successful over the years and that is what we must fight to obtain and sustain and develop in the future. Moving Europe beyond this crisis is not about abandoning our social model. It is, in fact, the opposite. It is about bringing our countries through the crisis with our fundamental values intact – values such as solidarity, safety nets and equal opportunities for all. The difficult decisions we are taking today and tomorrow should not be a departure from solidarity. On the contrary, we are doing these things to protect our way of life, our European social model and our values, and we will continue to do so. The only way forward is through stronger cooperation among all of us. The answer to our current challenges facing the Union is more Europe, not less, and that has been the guiding principle for the Danish Presidency throughout.</p>

    <intervention id="2-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and her whole team, particularly Europe Minister Wammen, for a very engaged and dynamic Presidency. The Presidency programme was called ‘Europe at work’ and I think it is fair to say that you were a Presidency at work. You made a real effort to contribute to ensuring stability for Europe in these difficult times. I particularly congratulate you, Prime Minister, for your personal commitment to competitiveness and growth and to the green agenda, areas in which your country, Denmark, is a great inspiration for many of us in Europe, and indeed in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The results of this work are, to a large extent, reflected in the conclusions of the European Council and cover the full range of the Union’s activities. Since we will be discussing the results of the European Council and the euro area summit in the following debate, in this speech I will only highlight a number of specific issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with the economy. We have almost completed the second European Semester. Very serious and in-depth work has taken place on the Commission’s proposals for country-specific recommendations and I am satisfied with the consensus that has emerged around them. This work cannot, of course, be separated from our agenda for economic growth. As the Commission has made very clear, growth can be achieved only through the combination of structural reforms and targeted investment. The Growth Compact, which has now been approved, recognises this and, indeed, paves the way for determined pro-growth action.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore appreciate, in particular, the speedy and constructive manner in which the proposal on the pilot project bonds for transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure has been handled. I am very happy that we have reached a final agreement on the Commission proposal. The initiative will stimulate investment in infrastructure at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also appreciate the efforts to reach an agreement on the so-called ‘two-pack’, which is a central element in the EU-level drive to strengthen economic and budgetary surveillance. This would also represent a first step towards implementing important elements of the fiscal treaty. Thus, I welcome the general approach in Council and I strongly hope that Parliament and the incoming Cypriot Presidency can come to a final agreement before the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally important is our progress in the area of financial markets and financial services. Agreement could be reached on our proposals on derivative markets and on the single European payment area. Very importantly, we are making enormous progress on the bank capital requirements package, as well as on credit rating agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the Commission proposal for a financial transaction tax has, unfortunately, not met with unanimous support from Member States, I would like to welcome the decision to start negotiations, under enhanced cooperation, for all Member States that wish to join the initiative. This is a very important development. After all, we have seen once again in recent months and weeks – both in the United States and in Europe, including in some of the major banking institutions – that practices which fuelled the financial crisis have not yet been eradicated from the sector. Once again, we have been confronted with reckless trading and market manipulation. It is time for these practices to stop once and for all, and for a sector that owes so much to taxpayers’ support to agree to hand back a fair share to society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the very difficult negotiations on the proposed directive on energy efficiency, the agreement found by the colegislators at first reading will be a major step in delivering the objective of 20% primary energy savings in 2020. The Commission estimates that the outcome reached would allow the delivery of approximately two thirds of the total energy savings in the Commission’s original proposal. So, while we welcome what has been achieved, we must also say that further work on reaching our 2020 objectives will be needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was very pleased by the agreement reached on the Roaming III Regulation. This is an example of legislation that truly benefits European citizens and consumers. The regulation entered into force on 1 July 2012. By putting a cap on data roaming, we are taking an important step towards protecting consumers against shock bills, and completing the digital single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe should be a global standard setter. Therefore, I also welcome the agreement reached on reform of the standardisation system, which will enable more efficient standard setting in Europe. Furthermore, the general approaches agreed in the Council on the accounting directives, on venture capital funds and social entrepreneurship funds, and on alternative dispute resolution will hopefully prove to be a good basis for reaching agreement with Parliament very soon. On the matter of professional qualifications, we could have wished for more progress, but work will continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is, of course, necessary to make special mention of the debate on the European patent, something which has been under discussion for decades. There was a compromise on this between the participating Member States, but unfortunately it comes at the price of the deletion of important Community elements of the original Commission proposal. While recognising the great efforts made by the Danish Presidency on this difficult issue, and indeed thanking you sincerely for those efforts, Prime Minister, the Commission has therefore reserved its position, and I made this very clear to the Heads of State or Government during the European Council. The situation will now require an assessment by the three EU institutions. We are ready to work with you on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">A central theme of the past semester was the effort made in bringing forward the multiannual financial framework (MFF). Last week, the European Council considered that the negotiating box prepared by the Danish Presidency provided a basis and orientations for the final stage of negotiation during the Cypriot Presidency, with a view to reaching an agreement by the end of 2012. In this respect, let me reiterate that the Commission is fully aware of and will call for full observance of the institutional prerogatives of all the EU institutions. It was the Commission, by the way, which strongly insisted on this point during the preparation for this European Council and, indeed, when its conclusions were adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">The debate on the MFF will now enter its decisive stage. The Commission considers that the negotiating box is still missing some important elements or, in our view, is not the appropriate answer in some areas. While fully recognising the very serious work done so far, the Commission will therefore continue to defend its proposals under the incoming Presidency. I believe it is now clearer that the European Union budget is an essential instrument for achieving sustainable growth and jobs through investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly happy that we managed to agree on a new Financial Regulation. I want to extend my thanks to the relevant players in Parliament and the Council who have worked closely with the Commission. I know we went through a process of long and difficult negotiations. The final adoption of the Financial Regulation before the end of the year will allow for proper implementation of all the sectoral programmes of the MFF. Thus, I strongly hope that the Council and Parliament, with the support of the Commission, will manage to reach agreement on the MFF by the end of this year. The European Union needs to send a signal that, until the end of this decade, it will have a strong budget for growth and cohesion. The European Union needs to show that it is able to take difficult decisions in difficult times.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the area of justice and home affairs, there has been good progress on important issues. Let me mention the asylum package, notably the Dublin II Regulation and the Reception Conditions Directive. Negotiations have also advanced on the Asylum Procedures Directive, and reform of the Visa Regulation is on track.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the same cannot yet be said of another important issue, namely, the legal basis and nature of the Schengen evaluation mechanism. We are all aware of the sensitivity of this issue. As far as the Commission is concerned, we want solutions that can work. That is why we believe, together with this Parliament, that we need a Schengen evaluation mechanism with a strong European dimension. We are convinced that an intergovernmental peer review model does not deliver on the mandate set by the European Council of March 2011, and that it would have limited added value in practice. Since the Lisbon Treaty in particular, free movement of people has been a genuine Community concern. As I have said before, the Commission cannot accept the current outcome as final, and it will continue to work for a better solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me end with a look at the external dimension. The focus on internal European issues has always had to be combined with a broader perspective on Europe’s role in the world, and never more so than in relation to the preparations for, and decisions in, the Rio+20 Summit for sustainable development. Although a number of our most ambitious objectives were not fully achieved, the European Union remained committed and constructive throughout the negotiations, and our positions had a very important impact on the debate. I would like particularly to welcome the very good cooperation between the Commission and the Danish Council Presidency. In fact, both Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt and I were present at this Rio conference. And let me tell you that without European leadership in this conference, we would not have achieved what appears to me to be a significant outcome. Green growth is now explicitly and formally accepted by the international community as an indispensable part of our sustainable development agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Important progress has been achieved during the past six months of the Danish Council Presidency. I wish to reiterate my thanks for what has been very good cooperation. However, we are only too aware of how serious the situation is and how much we still need to accomplish in the time ahead. I therefore count on the ongoing commitment and ambition of all the EU institutions in meeting our common challenges.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Prime Minister, Commissioner, the most typical response during a crisis is to dedicate all efforts to solving that particular crisis, leaving everything else aside. As we are well aware, during the past half-year – and not only during that time – the main focus in general and the main subject of discussions in the press has been the financial and economic crisis. The Danish Presidency has been greatly tempted to devote all its energy and all of its efforts to these matters only, leaving everything else that is also important to us aside. However, it has not done so. Here, I have to say hats off (particularly considering that it is a small country) for being able to simultaneously devote attention to, shall we say, the main problems that we have, while addressing many other issues as well. I will not speak about the many other issues. They have already been discussed by Mr Barroso and will still be discussed by others; I wish to focus on energy in particular.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Thinking about our interests in the future, it is, of course, very important that we are moving toward a single European energy policy. That will make our energy supply more secure, help reduce CO2 emissions and – very importantly – help reduce our import dependence. Under the leadership of the Danish Presidency, matters connected with energy efficiency legislation have been addressed, as have matters connected with the legislation on energy supplies from third countries, on which we shall not be voting in this House, in Parliament, until September. With regard to this legislation on energy supply agreements with third countries, the Danish Presidency met with absolute resistance from the rest of the Council. Essentially, most of the Member States of the Council did not wish to adopt this legislation at all in any wording, and, thanks to the leadership of the Danish Presidency, a compromise solution has been achieved on which Parliament will be able to take a vote in September, bringing us one step closer to a common energy policy. Therefore, hats off and my thanks to the Danish Presidency, which has devoted energy and efforts not only to solving the economic crisis, but also to other issues that are important to us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, many thanks for your Presidency and, above all, for the list that you read out today of everything that took place under the Danish Presidency. It is an impressive list, I really must admit that. Of course, the Danish Presidency was overshadowed by two factors that did not make life easy for you. First of all, there was the economic crisis. I am very pleased – and I am sure we will come back to this – that, in the end, at the final summit, we managed to take a few positive steps in the direction of growth, as that is absolutely essential if we are to overcome the crisis. Then, of course, there were the actions of the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Patents Directive has been mentioned. This House has been fighting for a European patent for years. The result will overcome the arguments and the animosities between individual countries. At the last moment, a few countries did manage to blemish this positive result, however. I actually find it very strange that, for example, the United Kingdom, which constantly criticises how we have three seats for the European Parliament, pushed for there to be three seats for the patent court.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">That is clearly a position that is absolutely intolerable. What it does show us, however, is what many a government really cares about.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was a similar story with the budget. Once again, the European Council got involved, although my fellow Members and the Danish Presidency managed to rescue the situation between them. The European Council – and I will also say this to Mr Van Rompuy – should concern itself with those things that are its responsibility. It should not be making out detailed legislation. That is not the job of the European Council – it is the job of the Council, together with the European Parliament, to legislate. That needs to be made clear at long last.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second item that I would particularly like to emphasise is the Energy Efficiency Directive. This is not just a directive; it is a position, a direction. I am grateful to Mr Turmes and Ms Thomsen, and all those involved, for having fought for this in the way that they did. Of course, we wanted more – they also wanted more – but again, there were a few countries that prevented us from taking a really big step forward with this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope, however, that, with your ongoing support as Denmark, the Member State, we will be able to bring about this energy switchover, that we will succeed in creating these thousands and even millions of jobs, for which there is a potential here. We are all asking where the work is and fearing that we are running out of jobs. No, we are not running out of jobs; especially if we concentrate on the energy switchover, if we aim to bring about the greening of the economy. This is about creating many, many jobs in Europe and, at the same time, reducing the dependence on imports of oil and gas. We have produced a very significant achievement here, and I hope that many countries which, at the moment, are still providing resistance will come to see that, in future, we will have to have truly mandatory provisions on energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Prime Minister, I would like to congratulate you on your choice of Mr Wammen as your Minister for Europe, as he really did an awful lot so that the Danish Presidency was able to succeed in many areas. I would like to thank you for that, Mr Wammen. You set a good example of how to act European but nonetheless represent the interests of your own country. If the Danish Presidency has many successes to list, that is down, above all, to you. Thank you for all your efforts.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr Barroso, we have heard a great deal about how the house of Europe is built of the bricks of solidarity, but houses must be built on solid foundations. That has been the distinctive line of the past six months: the link between solidarity and solidity. I would therefore have liked you to have said a bit more about solidity, Prime Minister, and to have talked about how we can exert better, stricter control over the situation that we are in – the debt crisis in the Member States that has dragged our currency down with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned the ‘two-pack’, and that indeed took place during your Presidency. In the case of the ‘two-pack’, we, as the European Parliament, called for a debt redemption pact. I believe we need to take a brave step forward if we want to be successful here. However, the Council’s decisions of last weekend leave a lot of questions unanswered. Mr Swoboda mentioned the growth pact. I know that it is something he is particularly concerned about. Der Spiegel called the whole thing a sham. A total of EUR 50-55 billion is supposed to come from the Structural Funds, but even Commissioner Hahn says he does not know how such figures are arrived at. I am not convinced that it is genuinely solid, that it will restore confidence among our citizens. Liability and control go together; that is the really crucial thing.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to liberate forces for growth, we want the European patent. However, and in this Mr Swoboda is absolutely right, what the Council has decided is completely absurd. A court that sits in three different places – London, Paris and Munich – is downright grotesque, and it shows that quite clearly the Member States are not capable of coming to sensible decisions on such an important, innovation-driving matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one question. A new system of banking supervision is now to be established on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty. I thought we had a European Banking Authority. Are we now going to have a banking supervisory authority with two seats as well? Are we going to get two different banking supervisory authorities? Precisely what form does the Council imagine this is going to take? You will find it pretty difficult to explain the proliferation of seats of various organisations to this Parliament and get support for it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In other respects, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for your committed Presidency. There are some other matters that you have progressed with real success. I have not mentioned Schengen, which was undoubtedly a sore point in your Presidency. However, the enlargement policy in respect of Serbia and Montenegro is undoubtedly one of the positive aspects.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister, imagine that one day, a President of the Commission says to us after six months: ‘You all know what we have done. We have done a lot, it is true, and we have done it with zeal, but now we must tell you what is blocked’. The problem that we have here is that you had a proposal, but we still do not understand why it has not been possible to conclude it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You spoke about the directive on energy efficiency. It is possible to lie to oneself? There are two countries who have blocked this: Germany and Poland. We must therefore look at how we can unblock Europe because while we are deluding ourselves by saying: ‘You see, we have done a good job, etc.’, we know very well that the decisions that we take are not up to the required standard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The energy directive is a good thing but we all know that it is insufficient. It is not your fault, it is the way that Europe functions that is being called into question. There was talk of the patent. Of course it is absurd, but the public must really understand this. The problem is not simply what we tell ourselves here; it also what the public can understand. When you have this contradiction with Mr Cameron, who gives lectures to everyone, and who, in fact, is preventing Europe from developing, the European public must understand, taking the example of patents, what it is all about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We could give other examples, in particular Schengen, which is self-explanatory, since, in the end, if we restore the opening and closure of borders, it marks the end of the European Community approach. It is very simple. All the interior ministers are responsible in this sense. Let us call a spade a spade, so that at least the public may understand what is at stake.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You talk about the integration of Serbia and Montenegro. Yes! Yet once again we are forgetting Sarajevo. We always forget Bosnia. Today, the only country that does not have a European perspective is Bosnia, a country that has previously fallen victim to nationalism in the Balkans. It is not sufficient to give ourselves gold stars – no doubt deserved – on the subject of Bosnia when we are talking about Serbia, because as long as we fail to find a solution for Bosnia, I personally will continue to have a guilty conscience.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to do two things this morning.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I want to wish the Secretary-General of Parliament a very happy birthday. I am sure he is delighted to be having to spend his birthday listening to us drone on in this Chamber. Secondly, and much more importantly, I would like to thank the Danish Presidency, their officials and ministers and all those whom we have dealt with over the last six months.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, Prime Minister, as a Socialist while I myself am a Conservative, I am sure there are many issues on which we would disagree. However, I would like to pay tribute to the typical Danish efficiency and practicality which has been sorely needed in the EU over the last six months. In particular, your Presidency should be congratulated for burying the financial transaction tax as an EU-wide initiative. It would have damaged many of the EU’s financial centres, and many ordinary savers and investors as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your administration should also be thanked for refusing to reopen negotiations on the Pregnant Workers Directive, which would have raised costs for businesses, reduced women’s choice and made it harder for many young women to find jobs. You should also be congratulated as a member of the EU net contributors club for pushing for budget restraint within the EU as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, when I look at many of the policy areas, it seems there are many lessons that you could teach the wider Socialist family about the responsibilities of power should you ever choose to come back to this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the row over the Schengen evaluation mechanism, I have to say you have my sympathy on this. After all, the decision to change the legal base was made unanimously by the Council – a Council which, as Mr Daul and others often remind us, is made up predominantly of leaders of the EPP. I think it is very unfair that the messenger should be shot over this incident.</p>
      <p sl="en">That aside, I think the Danish Presidency’s overall relationship with Parliament has been extremely good and I would like to thank in particular your Europe Minister sitting behind you, Mr Wammen, for all the work that he has done. He sat there tirelessly day after day in this Chamber, having to listen to a lot of brickbats and criticisms. I think he has done it extremely well, extremely courteously, and I am sure he has a great future ahead in your government.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister, overall, your Presidency has been a good honest broker between the institutions and we come away with a positive assessment of Denmark’s time at the helm.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, last year, the Danish Presidency made the following promise in its programme, and I quote: ‘The return of growth and higher employment to Europe must be secured in both the short and long term’. Today, it is time to take stock, and it has to be noted that, in the short term at least, this promise has not been fulfilled. In fact, the opposite is the case.</p>
      <p sl="da">We received the latest unemployment figures yesterday. They represent a human disaster – never in the history of the euro have so many people been unemployed – and this disaster is also a result of the EU’s demands for austerity, which the Danish Presidency supported from day one. Take Ireland as an example: on account of the fiscal compact, the Irish people will be forced to make excessive savings over the next few years. We are talking about savings that are so huge they will be equivalent to Ireland cutting out two thirds of its entire education sector.</p>
      <p sl="da">The growth and jobs pact that the Council adopted last Friday will not fix these sorts of consequences of the austerity policy. It is like putting a plaster on an open fracture. We currently have more than 25 million unemployed in the EU, and the Council adopts a jobs plan without any concrete objectives with regard to the amount by which unemployment is to be reduced. It is simply not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="da">When I spoke at the start of the Danish Presidency, I said that the people did not need more austerity measures dictated by the EU, but rather they needed jobs in order to improve our shared prosperity, and I said that the Danish Presidency now had to demonstrate whether it was part of the solution or part of the problem. Unfortunately, we have to concede today that, in this regard, the Danish Presidency was not part of the solution.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, well, Ms Thorning-Schmidt, you did it! No one has ever before sold off the family silver on such a grand scale only to then throw the whole lot away. You said ‘yes’ to the fiscal compact. You declared yourself to be ‘European at heart’. You abolished border controls. You maintained agricultural aid. For six months, you ingratiated yourself with the EU’s non-elected elite. Nevertheless, your government has been booed out of the European Parliament. The other day, you had to cancel the referendum on the Danish opt-outs, and yesterday you threw out European patents.</p>
      <p sl="da">What I thought would be an historic love story has turned out to be nothing but a soap opera. ‘Europe at work’, that was your slogan. Not since 1997 has unemployment in the EU been as high as it is today. The euro is not merely the Titanic after the iceberg; it is the Titanic at the bottom of the ice-cold Atlantic. Now the people of Europe are drifting around in the cold water in the hope that you, who sunk their ship, will come and save them. You will not do that, however, because you are fumbling around in the dark.</p>
      <p sl="da">You have held 20 summits to rescue the euro, but the only thing you have rescued is a disgraceful monument to yourself, and you have left an economy in ruins. Therefore, let me say this very clearly – so clearly that even you can understand it: shame on you.</p>
      <p sl="da">I have heard many people express their astonishment at the visionless Danish Presidency. You did not even meet your French socialist friends half way when they wanted to kick-start the economy. However, I know what lies behind this, because in reality, this has definitely not been an ordinary, proper sort of Presidency. It has been the longest job interview in world history – one long preparation for your pending defeat as Prime Minister in Denmark. In two and half years’ time, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council will be elected here in the EU. I am willing to bet that you will be a candidate for both posts. This is not for the power, but so that you can come home to your friends here in the EU. So watch out Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, watch out all of you sitting here ruling and governing without any popular mandate whatsoever. Here is a woman who will stop at nothing to get her way. That is something that the Danish people have experienced in great measure over the past six months. I therefore believe that I can safely say that I speak for the majority of Danes when I say: ‘Ms Thorning-Schmidt, please go home to the EU at last and let us have Denmark back’.</p>

      <p sl="da">Blue-card question. – Mr Messerschmidt has completely surpassed himself, even compared to last time, and I would not have thought that possible. Perhaps he should have been looking at himself in a mirror when he said ‘shame on you’, as this speech was certainly not worthy of him. We will let that lie, however.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is the patents that I just wanted to ask Mr Messerschmidt about, because he is clearly very concerned about the fact that the Prime Minister has thrown out the patents, but as far as I am aware, it is Mr Messerschmidt who wants a referendum on patents in Denmark and wishes to recommend – as I understand it – that we should not have a common patent court. Is that not correct, Mr Messerschmidt? What would you say, Mr Messerschmidt, to all those European and Danish companies that have been asking for a single European patent for 30 years in order to make it significantly cheaper for European companies to apply for patents and thereby increase their competitiveness?</p>

      <p sl="da">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, thank you for the question, which has two parts. Firstly, there is the question concerning a referendum. I am a keen supporter of referendums, as Mr Rohde well knows. We insisted on one in connection with the most recent amendment to the Treaty, while Mr Rohde’s party insisted on the opposite. We insisted on one in connection with the Fiscal Compact, while Mr Rohde’s party insisted on the opposite. Therefore, now that we have the facility under the Danish constitution, it is actually not so strange for us to insist on a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="da">I will turn, now, to the actual matter at hand. Well, our basic concern is the one that has also been expressed by the Association of Danish Patent Agents, and that is a concern about the rules on forum shopping. If it is the case that small patent holders can be forced to defend their patents at any national court, and from that court they cannot directly bring the case before the central authority, we have a problem in that this will potentially benefit the large corporations and their ilk, in other words, those that Mr Rohde will be keen to look after, but not the small patent holders.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the first half of 2012 has been characterised by the failure of the European Union, the failure of the euro and the loss of public confidence in the failed European dream. However, I also have some bad news for you. A number of southern Member States are on the verge of collapse. The coffers of unsuspecting taxpayers in northern Member States are being raided under the mantle of solidarity. Many citizens of the EU watched the recent developments surrounding the ESM with disquiet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, if the trend of the past year continues, the question will simply be whether we will still be standing here in six months’ time. More and more voices are being raised in the Member States of the EU in favour of the abolition of the EU and the euro. They are very much welcome, as far as I am concerned. The EU is past its expiry date because you cannot play on a broken violin.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, I would like to comment on the progress we have definitely achieved. For example, we have achieved an agreement on NSI efficiency. We also have an agreement on the Financial Regulation, which is another important matter. And that is exactly what Parliament wants: to achieve results.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, as coordinator of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for regional policy, I see too little progress in the process surrounding the multiannual financial framework. If we fail to achieve an agreement by early 2013, we simply will not be able to apply the new regulations and, in these times of crisis, we will have achieved nothing by 2014.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do have to say, and I am addressing this to the Council, that we have actually made progress in terms of the regulation on the general provisions applicable to the Structural Funds. However, there is a flaw there. There are important elements that fall under colegislation with Parliament and that have been thrown into the mix and addressed there in connection with the MFF. I am talking about matters such as the categorisation of regions, which is the competence of Parliament, cohesion representatives, the position of the common strategic framework, the performance reserve, etc.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Look at Article 312 of the Treaty of Lisbon, as well as Articles 174 and 177, and you will see a flaw there, an architectural error. Since this will be important in the negotiations over the coming period, I ask the Council today: do you want to resolve this situation or will the consequence of it be the entire MFF falling under colegislation? A large group of members put questions about this to the Council on 18 June. You are not observing the Treaty of Lisbon and we cannot allow that! With the mandate of the Committee on Regional Development, after the 11 July vote, we want to get down to work straightaway in order to discuss issues over which we have the final say. We cannot allow this!</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Europe is in the midst of an economic crisis. Several countries have been on the verge of serious economic collapse. Unemployment is alarmingly high and growth is worryingly low. At such times, the EU needs to deliver concrete results. At such times, the Member States need to stand together to create prosperity and optimism. It goes without saying that this is no easy task, but it is an important one, and it is a task that the Danish Presidency has successfully fulfilled.</p>
      <p sl="da">Does this mean that we have saved the world? Does it mean that the crisis is over and that Europe is now fully back on track? No, of course not, but it does mean that, over the last six months under Danish leadership, decisions have been taken that represent major steps in the right direction. Under the headings of ‘A responsible Europe’, ‘A dynamic Europe’, ‘A green Europe’ and ‘A safe Europe’, the Danish Presidency has delivered concrete results, political agreements and compromises which have direct significance for all European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="da">With over 20 million unemployed in the EU, with an explosion in youth unemployment and with numerous reasons for despondency, it is the many initiatives for growth that are particularly impressive, the most recent of which, of course, is the European growth pact. This is a pact that will create tens of thousands of jobs, a pact that will set the wheels in motion, but that will do this in a way that does not detract from our responsibility and the need for economic consolidation. With regard to other concrete results, the Energy Efficiency Directive springs to mind. This is legislation that is not only ambitious from an environmental point of view, and it most definitely is ambitious – in fact, it is the most ambitious legislation of this kind in the world – it is also legislation that will create a huge number of jobs – getting on for 2 million by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="da">We have seen more than 250 concrete results – 250 decisions that are important for European citizens. This is something that the EU can be proud of and that we here in the European Parliament can be proud of, and it is something that the Council, headed by the Danish Presidency, can rightly be very proud of.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I also believe that there is reason to congratulate the Presidency on a job well done. In this regard, I would like to take the opportunity to convey this to our capable civil service, but also to the Prime Minister’s Minister for European Affairs, Nicolai Wammen, who has done a huge amount of work here in Parliament, which I believe is appreciated by everyone here in this House, irrespective of their political affiliations.</p>
      <p sl="da">Not everything has been worthy of praise, however. There are also a few questions to be asked, as there are some things that surprise me. One of these is that, in her speech, the Prime Minister quoted Konrad Adenauer and said that she is ‘European at heart’. She also used part of her speech to talk about solidarity. It therefore surprises me that, in the Danish media during the last week, the Prime Minister has been quick to distance herself from a fiscal union, to say ‘no’ to Denmark being one of the countries that are to be responsible for the debts of other countries, which, in reality, we already are of course, and spent the week cancelling a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="da">May I remind the Prime Minister of her own words in a speech she made not so long ago, when she asked: ‘What international organisation in the whole history of human kind has ever been able to do anything like what the EU has done in the past six months?’ These are grand words, it has to be said. They are extremely grand words. I am sure that we could mention some events that were perhaps grander than what has happened here. How, though, does this fit with the fact that you do not want a referendum in Denmark? If we have taken such major decisions in the EU, then it should result in a referendum and not the opposite, Prime Minister.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Prime Minister, welcome back to the European Parliament. Last time you were here in this Chamber, you said something that I thought was very thought-provoking. You said that you had a very great understanding for the millions of young people who are battling with unemployment right now and with a lack of future prospects, just like your own generation did during the 1980s. The problem of youth unemployment has not gone away since January, but the good news is that, in contrast to only six months ago, there is now a much greater focus on creating growth and jobs for Europe’s young people. Six months ago, the mantra was cuts; now the mantra includes investment, growth and jobs. Now we also have a European youth guarantee included in the conclusions of the recent European summit. The Danish Presidency cannot take all the credit for this, but it can take some of it. Many thanks for that.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Denmark took over the Presidency at a difficult time. The European debt crisis meant that Europe’s leaders were using all their energy to discuss a fiscal pact and a fiscal union. There was talk of treaties, pacts and institutional changes instead of focusing on strengthening the internal market, eliminating subsidies that distort competition and quite simply boosting growth. The working conditions for the whole of the Presidency have been difficult, however.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would particularly like to thank the Minister for European Affairs, Nicolai Wammen, who has been very visible here in Parliament, and who has worked very hard to involve Parliament in the Presidency’s activities. Thank you for that, Mr Wammen. I am particularly pleased that the Presidency put antibiotics resistance on the agenda, and I am pleased with the Council’s positive conclusions. Of the most important results achieved by the Presidency, I would like to highlight the agreement concerning improved safety in relation to hazardous chemicals.</p>
      <p sl="da">There are also a few flies in the ointment, however. I am disappointed that the Council has decided to reduce the Commission’s proposals for a reform of the common fisheries policy. The Council has, in fact, decided that European fisheries do not need to be made sustainable. I am deeply disappointed that this has happened during the Danish Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we all know that the majority of people throughout Europe have long regarded the EU as a kind of Brussels-based bureaucratic behemoth – a behemoth in which decisions are made over people’s heads behind closed doors. In this respect, Denmark’s attempt to restrict the right of access to the files of the administrative and governmental apparatus in Brussels would undoubtedly have been a bitter setback to efforts to achieve greater transparency. Thankfully, it was given up at the eleventh hour.</p>
      <p sl="de">Talking of renationalisation in connection with the reform of Schengen is, however, undoubtedly an exaggeration, because ultimately, it falls within the competence of the Member States, which, in the final event, have to answer to their citizens in this regard. We are therefore not talking about an anti-European decision by the Council Presidency; instead, in this case at least, the craze for centralisation emanating from Brussels has been halted for once. However, Turkey should never have been granted visa facilitation as a reward for failing to cooperate on combating illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to allowing the EU Member States to set their own financial policy, however, Copenhagen – which has always seen itself as building bridges between the euro and non-euro countries – has given in to the mania for centralisation and paved the way for a debt union. While the Danish Presidency was thereby more or less digging a debt trap for the net contributors, it was taking great care not to fall into it itself. That is probably why the referendum on closer ties between Denmark and the EU and the euro has been postponed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, it has to be said that all the efforts of the Danish Presidency towards sustainability will come to naught in a European debt union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to sincerely congratulate the Danish Presidency on its excellent work and on the significant results achieved in the context of the European Semester. In particular, I offer my congratulations on its excellent negotiating skills which helped, albeit in a somewhat convoluted manner, to end the vulgar and absurd diatribe concerning the location of the European patent court.</p>
      <p sl="it">As rapporteur, I agreed, with regret, to postpone the final vote following the Council’s unilateral proposal to amend the proposal for a regulation, but I must point out that this way of operating is unacceptable. It seriously undermines the constitutional balance of the EU, especially in an area and a measure that are fundamental to boosting economic growth in the European Union in key sectors such as innovation. This is a measure in which Parliament took a programmatic, constructive approach.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore like to express my deep bitterness over what happened and call on the Council of Ministers, represented by the Cypriot Presidency that has now taken over, to find a solution with regard to the substance and the procedure as soon as possible. It will not be Parliament that causes a project that we have been working towards for over 30 years to fail, nor shall this Parliament allow the rules governing interinstitutional relations to be unilaterally modified by any institution.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Prime Minister, there were high hopes for the Danish Presidency, in the hands of a recently elected government at the worst point in the worst crisis the European Union has ever faced. Six months later, however, while acknowledging the progress made in terms of energy and in terms of the response to the crisis, the evaluation of the Presidency cannot be a satisfactory one because a shadow has been cast over it by the decision adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council to re-governmentalise the Schengen evaluation mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="es">This means not only ignoring the area of freedom, security and justice as a European policy in which Parliament is the ordinary legislator; it also means ignoring the fact that Parliament represents 500 million people as the sole body that is directly elected by them; it also means ignoring the fact that, as was stated at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Copenhagen, solidarity, which is enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, does not consist of re-establishing the internal borders of the European Union but rather of helping to establish joint management of its internal and external borders.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will therefore conclude by saying two things. The first it that this has affected the entire asylum package and the entire Schengen package. The second thing, however, is that political union cannot be identified with banking union or with guaranteeing deposits, but rather with rescuing the people, free movement of people and solidarity within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would also like to take this opportunity to say just one thing. Like so many other people, I am very happy with the Danish Presidency, and I would like to take this opportunity to express this and, in particular, to thank Nicolai Wammen for his excellent cooperation. One thing that I was slightly annoyed about is the fact that the Presidency has not done a bit more with the many ideas that are currently being put forward concerning what will happen after the crisis and how we can make headway in terms of creating popular legitimacy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate the Danish Presidency, and particularly Minister Wammen, for dealing with the difficult and delicate matter of the multiannual financial framework. I know that there are many controversies among Member States, but what happened during the Danish Presidency was a streamlining of the debate, creating a good basis for future understanding and agreement, and putting on the table some of the very important issues for Parliament, such as that of own resources, which has been thoroughly discussed for the first time. I would like to see further results here and I am optimistic that we can move ahead on that issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to express my warm thanks for the very good interinstitutional cooperation with the Council during the Danish Presidency – including giving Parliament, for the first time, the opportunity to speak at the General Affairs Council and present its views on the multiannual financial framework – and for the very good support from the Danish Presidency for the Council conclusions. I think that what the Danish Presidency has achieved is a good basis for agreement on the MFF in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, I completed two procedures under your Presidency: the Financial Regulation – providing a set of rules for the forthcoming multiannual financial framework (MFF) period – and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) procedure. This regulation had been stuck in a queue in the Council since November 2008, and building on the results of the Polish Presidency, you took this procedure to its conclusion. I would therefore like to thank you for two really very committed financial officials who worked on these dossiers, and I would also like to thank Denmark’s ambassador, Mr Tranholm-Mikkelsen. I will miss you; we will miss your efficient negotiation. You have really served the financial interests of the European Union well. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, six months ago, I said here that we had high expectations of the Danish Presidency, not only because we had a Presidency led by a woman, but because of its ambitious agenda in a period where Europe has multiple challenges to address.</p>
      <p sl="en">Six months is a short period to meet such expectations, but recent developments, such as the outcome of last week’s European summit, give us reason to believe that with the political will and the necessary unity, much can be achieved. I am referring here to the investment package and the financial transaction tax. The Danish Presidency put investment, growth and competitiveness as priorities, and I believe that package should help meet those objectives. I would like to thank the Danish Government, and especially Minister Wammen, for their hard work.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to highlight the commitments that the Danish Presidency has made towards gender equality. Progress has been made on some of them, such as increasing women’s participation in boardrooms. I regret, however, that despite the efforts of the Presidency, no agreement could be found at Council level regarding the Maternity Leave Directive.</p>

Naturally, I followed all the discussions, which were very intensive, and we made great progress. I commend them particularly for fixing roaming charges. That will make a big difference to citizens across the whole of Europe; they were outstanding also on energy. That, too, was very important. This time next year, my own country, Ireland, will be completing its six-month Presidency of the Council, and I hope that we will excel and do things the right way like Denmark.

I think it achieved a great deal, and I would commend everyone for that. I also think the Danish Minister for European Affairs, Nicolai Wammen, has done a really good job – as others have said. There was just one thing lacking in my opinion, and I also pointed this out a few times during the course of the Presidency. There has been a debate in Europe over the last six months, particularly in Germany, concerning how we can move forward and how we can create legitimacy among our citizens. I think it is a pity that the Danish Presidency did not really want to enter into this discussion. I had hoped that it would take the opportunity to engage in this debate, too. However, I can hope that, looking to the future – and the Prime Minister will hopefully confirm this – you will perhaps work together with Parliament in order to move forward in this discussion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, those who advance the European project see themselves as good Europeans. In fact, the project itself is geared towards the destruction of Europe’s distinct identity. This can be seen clearly in the programme of the Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Denmark sought to advance the candidature of Turkey, a country that is not ancestrally, culturally or religiously European. It sought to facilitate legal immigration, claiming that Europe is somehow in need of yet more immigrants. In January, it promised that immigrants would be ensured smooth and non-bureaucratic access. They have certainly kept their word about that. It has paid lip service to a returns policy for illegal immigrants, but we know from Frontex that they are not detained long but are released and given an order to leave that is neither checked for compliance nor enforced.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, it must seem strange to the outside world that we have been congratulating one another so very much, particularly as the markets are still nervous and ordinary people are angry about this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I think that the summit last weekend was, quite honestly, a disaster. It was appalling to witness the sort of unprecedented information war that various Member States engaged in from their own point of view, and in which they spoke of their own objectives. The messages that came out of the summit were highly contradictory. The worst of it was – and this has been evident here with regard to the patent issue, for example – that, once again, new policy was laid down on what were often very technical and detailed questions in the dead of night.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Researchers have found that if a person stays awake for 24 hours at a time, it equates to a blood alcohol content of one per mil, and that is the point at which driving a car is a crime. When people take decisions after staying awake so long like this, these sorts of problems arise. For that reason, and as you are such a creative person so full of ideas, Prime Minister, what does your experience tell you about how practices might be improved in the wake of this summit?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, unfortunately, the Danish Presidency was overshadowed by the unprecedented institutional crisis which resulted in Parliament being excluded from setting up the Schengen evaluation mechanism. Since this is a transnational system with a direct impact on Europe’s citizens, it would have been preferable, in the post-Lisbon era, for Parliament not to be deliberately excluded from making such important decisions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Denmark has demonstrated in a traditional manner transparency in making decisions, but this episode means that, as the European Parliament, our assessment is not positive. This is why I hope that the Cypriot Presidency will enjoy more success in completing this project and will bear in mind the democratic process which involves Parliament in the decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think this very rich debate clearly demonstrated what was mentioned by several speakers, that the Danish Presidency was hard-working, dynamic and practical, and delivered a lot. I think that progress on many files was very clear, and we in the Commission highly appreciate that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the efforts, it is clear that further work is needed on energy efficiency, the European patent and Schengen. In all of these very important areas, we need more ambition, more Europe, and a clear respect for the Community method. I particularly appreciate the Danish Presidency’s efforts and results, and the method used in organising the discussions and negotiations on the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister, your Presidency delivered a ‘negotiating box’ which is a good base on which we all can work to conclude negotiations by the end of 2012. You have been very clear on the importance of close cooperation with the European Parliament delegation. You continued regular meetings which, I am sure, will pave the way for good cooperation on this very important file and increase the chances that we will be able to conclude these very important talks by the end of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to highlight that with the opening of accession talks with Montenegro, the granting of candidate status to Serbia and the progress in cooperation with other Western Balkan countries, your Presidency sent a very strong signal of solidarity and cooperation from the European Union to the Western Balkans and showed them the way forward in mutual cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I appreciate the personal involvement of Minister Wammen, and the highly professional performance of the permanent representative, Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, because they helped me achieve progress on the file which has been on our table for more than three years, namely, how to better manage the agencies in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">We worked very hard with the European Parliament delegation under the leadership of Jutta Haug and I am absolutely convinced that our common approach on the principles will help us to avoid the situations we are facing now with the European patent. We will be able to manage the discussion on what we will need to establish as regards agencies in the future in a much better and well organised way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, leaders of political groups, honourable Members of this House, thank you very much for this debate. First of all, allow me to thank you for your kind words, particularly to our Minister for Europe, Nicolai Wammen. I think that it is a very good sign that at the end of a Presidency, you are all on first name terms with Nicolai and appreciate the hard work he has done.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have listened very carefully to your remarks and noted that we share the fundamental commitment of getting Europe back on track, a commitment to restore growth and create new jobs for the too many unemployed. Our Presidency has tried to do just that at a very difficult time, not least thanks to the work done in this House. We have taken big steps in the right direction and now we need to make sure that we continue to deliver together and we will continue our efforts in the Council to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">No doubt, when European citizens look at us – if they are looking at this debate at all – what they expect from us is that we will pull through the crisis together, and create new growth and new jobs in Europe. As I see it, this requires full use of the Community method. What does this mean? Well sometimes it means that we have heated debates about lines of division. That is how it will always be and this is how it has also been during the Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not be scared by that because that is how it is when you make compromises. Sometimes we agree, sometimes we do not. But we always share a common goal of serving Europe and serving its citizens. Let me try to address some of the main topics which you have raised today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you have rightly pointed out that we still are in a dire economic crisis, and you are right. It has been the case, and will continue to be so for some time, that we act every day against a heavy backdrop of the economic crisis, with thousands and thousands unemployed in Europe. That is why I am so happy that many of you have shared my concern in pushing for the implementation of the Growth and Jobs Pact. This is important. Some thought this Growth and Jobs Pact was not enough, and perhaps you agree, but nevertheless this is a small light in the dark that will create some hope that we can create growth and jobs in Europe again.</p>
      <p sl="en">We discussed this also at the European Council on Thursday and Friday and, as I said there, I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending to the Council that we strengthen cooperation with the Parliament in doing this: strengthen cooperation in terms of creating growth and jobs and perhaps fast-track some of the decisions that we need to take.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is, of course, important that at every step we take in the development of the Union, we respect the role of the European Parliament, and I have stated this very clearly in the European Council. I hope that we can all agree to urgently deliver on this Compact. European citizens have the right to expect that from us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would very much like to thank some of those who have mentioned the multiannual financial framework and I would warmly thank everyone who has participated in this House in these discussions. We have had a very close and constructive dialogue on the negotiations, and we have had that throughout the Presidency at all levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have done our utmost to fully respect the powers granted to the European Parliament and we have put great emphasis from day one on hearing your views and bringing them to the floor of the Council. I dare say that on this dossier, we have had the closest cooperation between any Presidency and the European Parliament ever seen. We all know that the negotiations ahead of us will be very difficult, but I hope that the involvement of the European Parliament will continue in the same constructive atmosphere as it has started.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you have mentioned the Patent Regulation and, of course, I have taken good note of your remarks concerning the patent. Let me remind you that Europe has waited more than 30 years for a solution, and when you wait for 30 years, you know that a solution will require a compromise. I understand that the European Parliament will continue to discuss this in September and I hope that the European Parliament will live up to its responsibility and help reach a final agreement for the sake of creating growth and jobs in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some have said: ‘This is not good enough; we want it differently’. I have no problem understanding that this is the position of the House, but again I would urge that we do not end up in a situation where we make the best the enemy of the good.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things I was particularly pleased to hear about in our discussion today was the many mentions of the green agenda. All of you here know that it has not been easy to push the green agenda in a time of crisis, but I am proud of the results that we have achieved together in this area, particularly when we talk about energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also extend special thanks to the Commission, to Commission President Barroso, when it comes to continuously promoting a green economy. He did that very well in Rio, he has done that throughout these six months, and I know that he will continue to do so. Mr Barroso’s devotion and commitment is crucial and I thank the Commission for it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is the best framework imaginable to overcome the challenges facing us today and tomorrow. The crisis we have right now, and the solutions we find, show that, even though we did not always agree, we did not give up on each other. We showed solidarity and we should continue to do so. Everyone here knows that Europe still faces a severe crisis, but the decisions that we take together will lead us step by step out of the crisis to a better future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that we will be judged on our capacity to cooperate and find compromises. Political leaders of today are judged by their results, not their intentions, and what European citizens expect from us is results. They expect solutions and we have tried to live up to that obligation over the last six months. We will continue to do that in the future so that Europe, after the past gloom and pessimism, can again see an area of growth, progress and optimism. I believe that this is possible, but it is only possible if we are committed to doing it together. Thank you very much for your cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="el">The review of the Danish Presidency of the EU Council in the first half of 2012 satisfied the euro-unifying bodies and the political face of the monopolies in the European Parliament. Under the Danish Presidency, the anti-grassroots regulations on ‘enhanced economic governance’ were pushed forward and became euro-unifying legislation and the ‘fiscal compact’ was signed, adopting measures to abolish collective agreements, cut wages and pensions and increase retirement ages in all the EU Member States. EU/US/NATO imperialist intervention was stepped up in Syria and Iran, in order to exploit the wealth-producing resources and people in the region. This was the work of the ‘leftist’ Danish Government.</p>
      <p sl="el">The interests of the monopoly groups were promoted, together with capitalist restructurings and anti-labour measures throughout the EU, and the last vestiges of labour, insurance and social rights were demolished, causing poverty and misery to increase day by day. This is how ‘leftist governments’ and the ‘leftist’ management of capitalism serve the plutocracy: by satisfying the requirements and aspirations of the monopolies, in an environment of ‘social peace’, self-delusion and hope that prove to be resoundingly false, leaving the workers at the mercy of fatalism, compromise and subjugation to the union of capital, to be delivered bound hand and foot to the barbarity of capitalist exploitation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Six months ago, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who had just been elected Prime Minister of Denmark, made a presentation to the European Parliament outlining the Danish Presidency’s priorities for the first six months of 2012. Looking at Copenhagen’s achievements today, we can congratulate Denmark on its successes in many areas, such as the EU budget, the multiannual financial framework for 2012-2020, climate policy and energy policy. Denmark deserves recognition, in particular, for its superb work on numerous legislative dossiers related to the digital agenda and intellectual property rights. As rapporteur responsible for the report on permitted uses of orphan works, I can only report positive experiences from our work together.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, recent steps taken by the Danish Presidency concerning proposals to reform Schengen and the possibility of the Member States restoring border controls have provoked considerable controversy in Europe, in particular, the proposal to deprive Parliament of its current right to vote and participate in the legislative procedure concerned. This matter is going to be given further consideration by the next Presidency, but it has cast a shadow over current perception of the results of Denmark’s leadership of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In summary, bearing in mind the fact that the Danish Presidency came at a politically difficult time in the EU in connection with the economic crisis and the financial problems of yet more Member States – now to be joined by Cyprus – the results of Copenhagen’s achievements would appear, on balance, to be positive.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the conclusions of the European Council meeting (28-29 June 2012).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As you know, ladies and gentlemen, at the informal summit on 23 May 2012, I proposed a growth pact to the European Council which involves all three EU institutions working closely together in order to take all the measures necessary to overcome the crisis in the coming six to twelve months.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I am grateful to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who took up this idea in the form of an interinstitutional agreement and put this to Parliament at its last sitting. Parliament then mandated me, by a broad majority, to present this idea to the European Council jointly with Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Unfortunately, the European Council did not accept our joint proposal for an interinstitutional agreement. I feel it is appropriate to comment on this. I make no secret of the fact that there was overwhelming support for our proposal in the European Council. By far the majority of the Heads of Government of the European Union advocated this interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">At the same time, however, it became apparent that the European Council has a structural weakness, and that is its unanimity principle. In my opinion, we will not emerge from the crisis while this unanimity principle exists.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to thank the Commission for its support. I should like to propose to you that the two institutions, the Commission and Parliament, stick with the idea of working in close, constructive cooperation towards expedited legislation – if that is what is desired – while completely safeguarding the rights of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">There is no doubt that the compromise reached in the area of the European patent, for example, does not set a good example of how to proceed. We are firmly convinced that together, in the interests of the people of Europe, we should do everything we can to emerge from this crisis swiftly and stronger than before.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I should like to pass on one piece of positive news. The European Council has accepted the human rights pact and the associated action plan, for which we as Parliament have fought long and hard. I believe that as the European Parliament, we should very much welcome this decision, since this package declares human rights and democracy to be a central element of European external policy.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">All of us here are convinced that the human rights package provides an extraordinarily good basis for making more effective, more coherent human rights and democratisation policy. We are looking forward to making the public aware of this human rights package through a formal interinstitutional declaration and documenting the support that this has from all three institutions.</p>

    <intervention id="2-052-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Herman Van Rompuy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Council">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, last week’s European Council was about combining short-term action to stabilise the markets and medium-term action to stimulate growth, together with a longer-term vision on the way forward to strengthen our Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was a sometimes difficult but in the end fruitful meeting. It was another step on the long road to overcoming the financial and economic crisis and correcting the structural flaws of the euro area framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">The steps we took last week were important on a number of fronts. First, we put together and decided on a Compact for Growth and Jobs. It will mobilise EUR 120 billion for immediate investment, which will boost the financing of the economy and help create jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">A EUR 10 billion increase in the capital of the European Investment Bank will increase the bank’s overall lending capacity by EUR 60 billion. The other EUR 60 billion comes, first, from the Structural Funds which will be devoted to growth-enhancing measures in the current period (EUR 55 billion) and, second, from the pilot phase of project bonds that will be launched this summer and will go to key initiatives such as energy, transport and broadband infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Compact for Growth is not just about injecting money. It contains a number of elements: work to be done individually by the Member States, which have already undertaken a number of commitments in that respect, and work to be done together as a Union, including deepening the single market, negotiating good trade agreements, working together on tax matters, and strengthening the European Research Area. Several Member States will launch a request for enhanced cooperation regarding a financial transaction tax with a view to its adoption by December 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said before, the European Council has not suddenly discovered the virtues of economic growth. Relaunching growth and creating jobs has been a constant concern, from the very first meeting under my Presidency in February 2010 right up until now. I am happy that this European Council has been able to give it a real push.</p>
      <p sl="en">The growth and jobs agenda requires a structural approach, but also short-term actions for financial stability. A return of confidence for consumers and investors will itself lead to more demand and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second main point is that, as eurozone leaders, we reaffirmed our strong commitment to do what is necessary to ensure the financial stability of the euro area. In particular, we affirmed that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, and we reached a number of important agreements to this effect among the eurozone Member States, the 17.</p>
      <p sl="en">We urged the rapid conclusion of the Memorandum of Understanding attached to the financial support to Spain for recapitalisation of its banking sector. We agreed that the financial assistance to Spain will be provided by the EFSF until the ESM becomes available, and that it will then be transferred to the ESM, without gaining seniority status.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will shortly present proposals for a single supervisory mechanism for the financial sector, on the basis of Article 127 of the Treaty, so involving the European Central Bank. We ask the Council and Parliament to consider these proposals, as a matter of urgency, before the end of the year. When an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, the ESM would, for banks in the euro area and following a regular decision, be able to recapitalise banks directly, of course under certain conditions and in certain circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aim is clearly to avoid this recapitalisation impacting upon public debt. This single supervisory mechanism was a key proposal in our recent report ‘Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union’. It is a breakthrough. It also shows a clear link between the longer-term measures we are proposing and the short-term actions we are taking.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Euro Group will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector, with a view to further improving the sustainability of Ireland’s well-performing adjustment programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">To ensure the financial stability of the euro area, we agreed to the possible use of existing EFSF/ESM instruments in a flexible and efficient manner, in order to stabilise markets for Member States which are complying with our common rules, recommendations and timetables. The short-term measures in both areas respect the fundamental approach of the eurozone’s policies ever since the start of the crisis: responsibility and solidarity. We need both. We tasked the Euro Group to implement these decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third important point concerns further deepening our Economic and Monetary Union. At their informal dinner of 23 May, the Heads of State or Government asked me to prepare, in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, the Euro Group and the European Central Bank, a report on the future of the Economic and Monetary Union. The financial and debt crisis has exposed structural weaknesses in the EMU’s original design, which must be addressed. The stakes are high.</p>
      <p sl="en">My report was not a final blueprint or master plan but offered a perspective on how to strengthen the EMU. It provided the main building blocks and a working method. It proposed an architecture based on more integrated frameworks for the financial sector, for budgetary matters, and for economic policy. It underlined the importance of strengthening, at the same time, the democratic legitimacy and accountability of decision making within the EMU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council has asked me to continue this work, again in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, the Euro Group and the European Central Bank, and associating the governments in this process. It will also ensure that our Parliament’s views are taken into account, and I look forward to working with you on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, we first need to exhaust all possibilities under the current treaties, then explore which avenues could require treaty change. The October report will focus on the first type of proposal. Some solutions will be tailor-made to the members of the eurozone and those who are expected one day to join the euro. But the actions will matter for all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">This European Council also discussed other matters. We had our first discussion during a European Council on the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020, a discussion to which your own President made a significant contribution. Under the Treaty, this is a matter for the Council of Ministers and for your Parliament. However, we all know from past experience that this is one of the areas in which the European Council will inevitably be called on to fulfil its role, under Article 15 of the Treaty, of defining ‘the general political directions and priorities’.</p>
      <p sl="en">In having a discussion on the principles and priorities without specific figures, it was my intention to focus attention not on national advantages and disadvantages but on the strategic priorities for the Union as a whole. The European Council agreed that the MFF needs to be at the service of a strategy: jobs and growth throughout the Union. Hopefully, we will finalise the work before the end of the year at the level of the Council. Your Parliament, which adopted an important resolution on the MFF, will, of course, be involved in this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council found – finally – a solution to the question of the European patent. The last outstanding point, the seat of the Unified Patent Court, was solved. After decades of unsuccessful attempts, this is a truly historic agreement. I call on your Parliament to finalise the agreement with the Council. I thank the Danish Prime Minister for the close cooperation we had in this respect, which led to our joint appeal to our colleagues’ sense of compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">We endorsed the decision to open accession negotiations with Montenegro – a signal to the Western Balkans as a whole that they may have a European future if reform processes are maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">This concludes my report on a European Council meeting that achieved some significant results and took us a few more steps down our journey towards economic recovery. We dealt with short-, medium- and long-term problems. We found a balance between responsibility and solidarity. We worked on growth and jobs, on the one hand, and on financial stability, on the other hand. We need reforms in our Member States and collective action at the level of the EU and the eurozone. All this has to go hand in hand. It takes time. It demands courage. It will be implemented step by step. The agreements of Thursday and Friday are steps in the right direction.</p>

    <intervention id="2-053-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the President of the European Council has just made a comprehensive presentation of the results of the European Council conclusions. I would therefore like to focus my presentation on the economic and financial issues, many of which I have presented to this House and discussed with Members previously.</p>
      <p sl="en">This European Council and euro area summit has delivered results. It has delivered a set of measures which should strengthen confidence in Europe’s financial stability and pave the way for the substantial work which is still needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has done this at a very difficult moment. As I have said before, this is a defining moment for Europe, and indeed the sense of urgency was very present throughout the European Council, even if different governments were under pressure for different reasons. And as the causes of the pressure differ, so do preferences for potential solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet, despite those difficulties, this European Council and euro area summit has, for the first time, tackled all the elements of a comprehensive response in one and the same meeting: namely, by agreeing on measures to boost growth and jobs, by setting out the next steps for further deepening of Economic and Monetary Union and by deciding on short-term stabilisation measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, as you know, has always argued that consolidation must be accompanied by sustainable growth created by structural reforms combined with targeted investment. It was therefore important that Heads of State or Government decided on the Compact for Growth and Jobs. This compact is based, very largely, on proposals put forward by the Commission and on ideas defended by this House, some of them since last year or even some years before. It turns intentions into concrete action with financing commitments, and sets out the levers for mobilising policies and funds – both at European level and at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased that elements I have long been advocating at EU level are now becoming reality, namely: boosting the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank – you will remember, when I mentioned this here in the State of the Union address in September last year, Member States opposed this, but now they have agreed; launching the first phase of project bonds – this Commission proposal that was initially received with great scepticism has now been approved; and redirecting a certain amount of Structural Funds towards supporting, in particular, SMEs and young unemployed people. Indeed, the unemployment situation in Europe is by far the most worrying and urgent issue we should be able to address.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, there is the recognition that we have important work to do to realise the full potential of the Single Market, particularly in digital and network industries. Following the Single Market Act, the Commission will bring forward a further package of measures in the autumn, the Single Market Act II, so that this work can continue uninterrupted.</p>
      <p sl="en">This, of course, is not the end of the efforts that need to be made. Legislation needs to be proposed, adopted and implemented. Action will be needed not from one institution on its own; all of us, Commission, Parliament and Council, need to work together, and work together fast.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was recognised last week, and the conclusions acknowledge the need to improve cooperation to ensure the timely implementation of the Growth Compact. This will hopefully allow us to move towards an interinstitutional agreement to prioritise and speed up the relevant pieces of legislation, as I proposed in this House some weeks ago and as the European Parliament President made very clear in his offer to the European Council. I really expect such an agreement to be swiftly concluded. It would be an additional element of commitment and credibility on the delivery of our policy plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council also generally endorsed the country-specific recommendations effectively closing the 2012 European Semester. This year, the semester has come of age with a real multilateral discussion. It is only natural that on some issues, there was a vigorous discussion, even when the evidence of loss of competitiveness inside the single market and internationally makes a clear case for action in the interest of our citizens and their jobs. The debate shows that the exercise is not just a technical and economic one. It is truly political.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the debate in the European Council, the awareness among many Heads of State or Government that we cannot separate the debate on growth from the debate on the European Union budget has also increased. The EU budget is our most important instrument for targeted investment and is an indispensable tool for growth and jobs in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">A long and complex negotiation is still ahead of us, but there is now momentum for a substantial outcome in reasonable time. This House has a full and vital role to play in this process, and the Commission will continue to work very closely with you.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would indeed be a strong political and economic signal if we could reach agreement on the MFF by the end of this year. I am aware that this Parliament will want to work not only on the expenditure side, but also on the revenue side. I have already spoken about the overall developments on the financial transaction tax in the previous debate. Let me just reiterate in this context our conviction that moving to enhanced cooperation on the FTT does not mean that the debate on the FTT as an element of a new own-resources mix is closed. On the contrary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking to the future, this European Council was able to define, on the basis of the report prepared by its President, together with the Presidents of the Commission, the European Central Bank and the Euro Group, the direction that further work must take on the creation of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. We all know that this is an undertaking that has to be built step by step over several years. This European Council has now asked for a specific and time-bound road map to be worked out by the end of the year. And it has endorsed this aspiration collectively, even if it is clear that not all Member States will want to be part of the ultimate outcome of the process. A stable euro is in the interest of the Union as a whole. The process must therefore combine the necessary deepening of the euro area and its openness towards the Member States who want to join the euro with the necessary safeguards for those who have an opt-out.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Commission’s view, we should start making the genuine EMU a reality as quickly as possible. We must, in particular, explore all that can be done on the basis of the existing treaties as a matter of urgency. In support of this, Heads of State or Government gave a clear commitment to the realisation of what the Commission has been calling a ‘banking union’ and we have done it already in our European Semester communication.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ‘banking union’ will be designed to fully address the structural shortcomings in the institutional framework for financial stability. As the aforementioned report puts it, addressing these shortcomings is particularly important for the euro area, given the deep interdependences resulting from the single currency. This must, of course, be done and must preserve the unity and integrity of the single market in the field of financial services, whilst allowing for specific differentiations between euro and non-euro area Member States on those parts of the framework that are preponderantly linked to the functioning of the EMU and the stability of the euro area rather than to the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me emphasise that these differentiations cannot go just in one way. Because it is so important, I want to make it crystal clear: they must respect the opt-outs from the euro area but they must also respect the fact that other Member States not yet in the euro will want to join as soon as they meet the conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the European Council, I confirmed that the Commission will bring forward proposals under Article 127 regarding the conferral upon the European Central Bank of banking supervision tasks. The strengthening of bank supervision became a central element of the consensus around this agenda. We will work out the detailed approach and its place in the wider architecture as a matter of priority and look forward to discussing it with all stakeholders, including, of course, this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe a banking union is an indispensable step. But a genuine EMU must go further. We need to build a fiscal union, a reinforced economic union, and take steps towards a political union. This is the logical consequence of the need for deeper integration to match our growing interdependence and need for financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we recognise that this greater solidarity requires greater responsibility, we also understand that this requires more democratic legitimacy and political accountability. I need not repeat what I said about this matter to you just a month ago. The Community method and the role and tasks of the EU institutions must be the starting point for all further improvements in this respect – and, let us be frank, it would be strange to say the least, when we are discussing the future of our Union, including its democratic and accountability aspects, for the democratic institution that directly represents European citizens, the European Parliament, not to be closely or directly associated with our decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would not have been credible to address medium-term and long-term issues and not address the short-term challenges we face. Here, the euro area statement takes great significance. Let me underline the importance of this statement having been endorsed by all 27 Member States. This is a strong message and has been perceived as such by the outside world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first measure is to allow for direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM under appropriate conditions once a single supervisory mechanism for the euro area is in place. The Commission’s intention to swiftly adopt a legislative proposal on the basis of Article 127 is also key in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we reached an agreement to waive the seniority of future loans for Spain’s financial sector recapitalisation under the ESM.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we agreed on the possibility of the flexible and effective use of all instruments for all Member States respecting their obligations under the European Semester, that is to say, the country-specific recommendations, the rules under the Stability and Growth Pact and the macro-economic imbalances procedure. These decisions represent the result of the recognition of the need for solidarity with responsibility. The Commission will work without delay on implementing them over the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p sl="en">After this European Council, provided that all Member States stick fully to the commitments that were made, we will be better equipped to face the serious challenges ahead. However, let us recall that all of this is work in progress. There is no quick fix, no magic fix, and there will be no magic solutions. The magnitude of the agenda of the European Council illustrates the magnitude of the work that is still ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">This European Council has pulled together many separate ideas which have been discussed in the past, and I believe the result is greater than the sum of its parts. It does not mean that the crisis is over, far from that, but it does mean that there is now an expression of the political will to move ahead, to respond to pressing short-term issues, as well as to map out a vision of Europe in the longer term. The contributions this House has made to this end have been great and we welcome them. This is why I count on our close and intense cooperation also in the times to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me end on this. While there was progress in recognition that there is a need for a stronger Europe, there was also very significant resistance to further steps forward, but there is a resistance precisely because there is movement. I want to reiterate my confidence that together, we will be able to make the European Union emerge stronger from the crisis and be able to better respond to the aspirations of its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the thirtieth European Council dedicated to the crisis. Although, in comparison to previous meetings, we are closer to reaching the desired solution, the road map towards European political integration is still not forthcoming.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, this time, substantial progress has been achieved. Following the country-specific economic recommendations proposed by the Commission, the document presented by Mr Van Rompuy is a step in the right direction, as it finally refers to political Europe as the ultimate aim. He mentions a preparation period spread over 10 years. Yet, each of us knows that Europe will not survive between now and 2022 without budgetary, fiscal and social integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I often wonder what political development the Twenty-Seven will judge sufficiently serious in order to consent to shared sovereignty. I wonder what graver problems are necessary, other than unemployment, the difficulties experienced by our companies, the prohibitive interest rates that our Member States must pay, in order to prove that a single currency must include a common economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is satisfied with the advances contained in the Growth and Employment Pact, even though this contains some of the long-standing proposals already put forward by this Parliament and the Commission. In this respect, I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you must continue, together with Parliament, to put whatever is needed on the table, because when the Heads of State or Government come together, they are unable to find a solution. For each of them, it is a question of survival in their own countries. Therefore, we need Parliament, together with the Commission and Mr Van Rompuy, to come forward with, and put on the table, concrete proposals so that when governments find themselves strangled by the markets and suchlike, they may have a solution, as was the case with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group supports the system of banking supervision, the proposal for a European guarantee and the European banking union project. Our fellow citizens must know that their savings are protected at all levels and that the instruments used to guarantee them are going in the right direction. Here too, we must strengthen protection. We need to guarantee the savings deposits of people who have worked all their lives, and you know we have problems with this issue at the moment. What now remains is the implementation of the instruments. That is why I again call upon the Commission, the Guardian of the Treaties, to ensure this happens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The PPE Group also supports the EUR 10 billion increase in capital from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Indeed, we must ensure that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can finance their projects, keep their employees, in the first instance and, above all, be able to hire new staff. Although the provisions on the single market remain insufficient, project bonds, which were decided upon last Friday, are a step in the right direction. I welcome this move, insofar as it does not consist of supplementary funds that no longer exist, but rather better use of existing European funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to highlight here that last month, the Latvian Prime Minister once again came to speak to our group in order to tell us that, faced with the imperative of budgetary cuts that were being forced upon him, he has only been able to restart his country’s economy thanks to European funds. This is an example that must be repeated. The Latvian Prime Minister did it and he informed his citizens. Thanks to European solidarity, combined with the courage of its leaders, this country has restored growth and employment. Just because it is a small country does not mean that we cannot emulate this example. We do not talk enough about these amazing examples for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we see that the solution to the majority of our problems lies in having more Europe. It is for that reason that my group places so much importance on the next multiannual financial framework, which is presently under discussion, as it will allow us to continue to finance our common policies. These funds constitute the base of European solidarity and are an essential instrument for growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the 1950s, European integration was necessary to guarantee peace and security in our continent. Today, this same integration is essential in order to protect our European social model which we have patiently constructed. It is essential in order to defend our common interests in international trade. It is essential for the promotion of our values and our humanist ideals, human rights, human dignity, transparency and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I repeat my call for a politically integrated Europe, not an intergovernmental Europe, as was supported by the Council in the Schengen case, or again last week concerning the issue of patents. For as long as the Community method is not our governance rule, nor that of the Council, Europe will lose ground. I know you have a difficult job, Mr Van Rompuy, but fear not! Make proposals with us, with Parliament and the Commission, to these Heads of State or Government who, as I said, do not have the capacity for reflection as they are obligated to manage their very difficult issues on a daily basis in each of their respective countries. We need a much more integrated Europe. We must compare what works, the countries that cope – because there are some – and apply their example to those that work less well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There you have what I want us to put on the table, Mr Barroso, during the next two months. We will reflect further on this during the holidays and then we will make proposals in September, if the markets allow us to do so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, it is possible that this summit could go down as a turning point in the history of the European Union and of the euro area. A lot of things were decided that could take us forward in a positive way, if they are now also approved by the Heads of Government which decided them – and I will come back to that – and if the Commission and this Parliament now also turn the specific proposals into legislation, for example, on the banking union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are saying goodbye, goodbye to Merkozy, goodbye to a structure in which two parties – let me correct that: one party – believed they could decide what would and would not happen in Europe. I am very grateful to President Hollande for having strengthened the voice of social democracy. I am likewise very grateful to Mario Monti, who has shown though the same persistence as Chancellor Merkel, that things cannot continue as before. I would also like to thank Mr Rajoy, because Mr Rajoy has also commented that there need to be changes in Europe if we are not to end up with a fatal crisis of the euro area and of Europe as a whole. We can now see light at the end of the tunnel, although people are right to say that we have not yet come through the tunnel. Nonetheless, we can see light. It is now a matter of moving towards that light.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two possible economic cycles that we must decide between. One is austerity, which reduces growth and investment and increases the deficit. That is the cycle we are in. The other cycle is growth and investment, which reduces the deficit and improves budgetary equilibrium and thus, in turn, growth and employment. The figures today show that we have the highest unemployment rate in the euro area, so it is high time that we implemented what we decided at the summit and do even more besides. We must promise the unemployed that we really will implement these things, because they deserve it.</p>
      <p sl="de">This does not mean abandoning reforms. Would anyone say that Mr Monti is not carrying out reforms in Italy? If so, they should come out and say it here. Would anyone say that Mr Rajoy is not carrying out reforms in Spain? If so, they should say it here. What use are reforms, however, if there is no growth to support the reforms? What was decided at the summit is actually the only chance we have of enabling the reforms to succeed at all, which is why it is the right thing to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me be quite clear, however, in saying that there are two prime ministers – as I understand it – who have already backed down from what was decided at the summit, who have said that they will not be able to support it. I have some questions for the prime ministers of the Netherlands and Finland. Were you asleep? It was late at night, so perhaps you were. Did you not understand what it was about? Or do you want to say something different at home to what you say in Brussels? Whichever way, it is scandalous. Mr Van Rompuy, I ask you to call on the two prime ministers to acknowledge the outcome of the summit.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I ask the Commission to now submit swift proposals for the banking union and much more. The Commission and the European Parliament indicated as far back as two years ago how important it was to have real European banking supervision. Back then, the Council and its members said it was all much too much, we have to shoulder the responsibility – not knowing or not wanting to know how the financial systems are linked together and networked and that we need this European supervision.</p>
      <p sl="de">We could have had all this already. All of which leads me onto another essential point, Mr Van Rompuy, and that is the relationship of the Council and some prime ministers or ministers with the European Parliament. Let me start with Schengen. What was done is scandalous. We have made this quite clear to the Council Presidency. It is not acceptable. I am very grateful to you, President Barroso, that today you reiterated quite clearly your support for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European patent: exactly when, Mr Van Rompuy, did the European Council start making legislation at midnight? That is not the Council’s job. The Council is mandated to make legislation with the European Parliament, but not on its own. Most prime ministers, and I do not blame them for this, do not even know in detail what you took out of the regulation. Is it really such a great solution – I am still waiting for an answer from Mr Callanan on this – for the United Kingdom to now propose three seats? Perhaps the UK would also like to have an additional seat of the European Parliament in London – that is quite possible too, before or after the referendum. I do not know what Mr Cameron has in mind.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I very much appreciate what the President of the Commission said on this. As I have already said, we could have had the banking union long ago. I still do not understand – perhaps that is not your fault, Mr Van Rompuy – why the President of Parliament was not invited to the deliberations. We are not talking about detailed legislation here; we are talking about the future of Europe. You are debating the future of Europe without a representative of the only directly elected body in the European Union. I consider that scandalous. It is an attitude that I find unacceptable.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Discuss with us, invite us! As the example of the banking union shows, nearly all the groups of this House come up with good ideas – we just think of them earlier than the Council. It might not be a bad thing for the Council to come up with these ideas earlier for once, too, through discussions with the European Parliament. Listen to the European Parliament a bit more and invite the President of Parliament to attend your deliberations.</p>

    <intervention id="2-056-000" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy VERHOFSTADT" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group" nationality="Belgium" birth_date="11-04-1953" birth_place="Dendermonde" m_state="BE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, let us first of all welcome a number of decisions that have been taken by the European Council. First of all, I think we should welcome the growth package that has finally been decided and the necessary provision for tightening the budget in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also the decision on a single banking supervisor. I should say: finally a decision. You will remember that two years ago, the Member States and the Council refused to go in that direction, as Parliament requested at that time. The Commission advised caution and said that we could do it later. Well, it is later now and I think it is a good decision. The only thing we should ask is that, if we create this new agency, we do not split it across three Member States. It has to be a real single supervisor with powers to close down banks in any Member State, and with no exception.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Van Rompuy, I will not discuss the third decision: more flexibility for the EFSF and the ESM. Apparently, a number of Member States today have another opinion – mainly Finland. My question to you is what has been really decided now? Is Finland’s opinion and statement the right one? Is it necessary to have unanimity or not?</p>
      <p sl="de">I think this is a key question. Why is it a key question? Because already today, if you look at the markets, you can see the effect of this attitude. The Spanish spreads had gone up again to 491 by mid-morning – that is almost 500 basic points – so we are not out of this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main thing that we did in this European Council was to successfully borrow time again. How much I do not know. Is it days, is it weeks, is it months? But we must use this time in a good way. Why? Not like previous occasions, not like in December 2011, for example, when the European Central Bank performed two operations and injected EUR 1 trillion into the banking system. Some of us thought that the crisis was behind us, that the crisis was over. Well I think that we wasted time at the beginning of this year. Apart from the Fiscal Compact, no structural solution was found to the crisis at that time.</p>
      <p sl="de">So my message today is that we should not waste time again. Is it really necessary to wait for an interim report in October and then for a final report by the end of the year? This is not an interim crisis. We need fundamental action now. I think it is better not to wait until October and then wait until the end of the year to take action.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to use the positive spillover from Friday’s decisions to launch directly the economic and political union we desperately need so we can show the outside world – our friends in the G8 and the G20 and the markets – that we have learned our lesson. So action is needed and, Mr Barroso, action means concrete legislation. My plea to you is very clear. We now have a window of opportunity only of a few weeks, not more than that – and if Finland continues in this way, it will even be destroyed within a few hours.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must come forward, before September, with a concrete legislative package. I agree with Mr Daul that we have until September to do that and to put a legislative package on the table with three elements: firstly, a real banking union – not only supervision but also a deposit guarantee scheme and a joint resolution fund; secondly, a real integrated budgetary framework, including eurobills and a redemption fund – this crisis is not over if there is not at least the beginning of a redemption fund and a partial mutualisation of the debt; and, finally, democratic transparency and accountability.</p>
      <p sl="de">So, Mr Barroso, use your right of initiative. Do not wait until the end of the year. Put this legislative package on the table for the Council and for Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card question. – Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, allow me to ask a question as I, like you all, am very worried.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If you look at the statistics, they show that from September onwards, we will increasingly see a situation in which some countries will have made unswerving efforts over a period of several years, and other countries will not have made such efforts. These countries will refuse to continue and will no longer be able to pay for solidarity because things are going badly for them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in the Democrat groups, we must also, from August onwards, discuss the formulation of real proposals. For we cannot spend money that we do not have.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, Mr Daul, I would simply like to state that we cannot say that Spain or Italy have not made any efforts. They have made efforts. However, the problem is very simple. Mr Monti can take any measure and implement any cuts that he wishes, but half of his efforts will be eaten up by shareholders and by interest rates that stand at, and will continue to stand at, around 6-7%.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">This problem will only be resolved when the Council recognises the need to partially pool the debt via the use of eurobonds and sinking funds, which Mr Van Rompuy refers to in his note and which has still not been accepted by the Council, and if the Commission introduces a proposal along those lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not see any Head of Government who will be able or who will have the courage to turn down such a proposal once the Commission introduces it, given that the proposal will also have a positive effect on interest rates and the markets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, the first thing I must say is that if, following the European Council and the decisions against the crisis, we keep discussing whether Chancellor Merkel has been toppled, whether President Hollande or Mr Monti have won, whether the south is marching on the north or vice versa – so long as we do that, then I do not think we are on course to overcome the European crisis.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I also have to tell you that I find all these jabs based on football analogies quite repellent in these times of crisis, because all we know politically at this point in time is that if we do not manage to come together as a European team, then we will fail.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this connection, I did find comfort in some of the things that have been communicated from the Council corridors. Indeed, one might get the impression that the Council has actually learnt something from these difficult recent sessions. I got the impression that it has at last understood that we are not dealing with a sovereign debt crisis, but with a crisis of our common currency, because the euro can only function as a common currency if, in fact, we also have a common fiscal policy. This recent recognition that it will also only work if we construct common supervision of the banking sector and a common banking union is something that I found a comfort, because in the final event, whether or not the Council has learnt these fundamental things is absolutely crucial.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also thought it very good that it seems increasingly to be grasping the fact that the euro can only work if the countries in the euro area are prepared to take on debts and risks within this common currency area. I was pleased to see that this realisation has grown, even though in the days leading up to the summit, Chancellor Merkel made it a matter of life and death. In this connection, it was also very important that, as regards Spain and Italy, it was decided that it was essential to separate bank risk from sovereign risk, and that in fact, we must not allow countries to be dragged deeper and deeper into the abyss because they have to try to provide guarantees for bankrupt banks. Unfortunately, these insights that I have described, and which gave me some comfort as I observed the Council, were not then sufficiently incorporated into the decisions. What was decided in respect of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is highly conditional, just as before.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I should like to support what the previous speaker, Mr Verhofstadt, said. If you wait until the end of the year, then I would venture to say to anyone living outside our continent who has always wanted to come here: visit Europe while it still exists! If you and the Commission do not put proposals on the table for September concerning how we can now construct the banking union as quickly as possible; how we want to work in a fiscal union with eurobills, a debt redemption fund and then the prospect of eurobonds; if you do not make it clear how we actually want to communitarise all the crisis instruments, including the ESM and EFSF; if you do not present a convincing pact for lasting economic recovery and development; if you do not make it clear how you wish to develop and implement the financial transaction tax; if you do not put forward a really convincing programme to combat youth unemployment – then we will not get far with restoring confidence in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, it is you who, together with the European Parliament, must exert pressure to ensure that the next decisions are genuinely ready for debate in September. Mr Van Rompuy, I realise that you and I are different kinds of people, but the sedate way that you notify us of the Council’s inadequate decisions time and time again is something that is simply beyond my comprehension.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I should like to ask Ms Harms whether what she describes as a comfort – the prospect of joint liability, common risk – does not necessarily also entail shared political control, or should be viewed in parallel with this. After all, the debts for which we are jointly liable today are the taxes of tomorrow. No taxation without representation. That is a very important point.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second, very specific, question is as follows. You said that bank risk should be separated from sovereign risk, and that we have now succeeded in this. However, the European Stability Mechanism, which is currently recapitalising the banks, is borne by sovereign states. In other words, sovereign risk is being distributed differently, but it is still there. What is your assessment of this? I take a very critical view of it, and where the conclusion of the Euro Group is concerned, I am decidedly sceptical as regards how vague it has been kept and what impact it will have in practice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr Lambsdorff, if you have followed the debates, then you will know that my group has always advocated a process based on the formula of solidity plus solidarity. The fact that we have not moved forward in both these areas simultaneously has had a devastating effect on the situation in Europe and has heightened the European crisis; instead, we have concentrated solely on budgetary solidity – particularly because of Germany’s attitude – while at the same time demanding of countries that they take on significant risks. I believe that, with the fiscal pact, we have laid the basis for us now to increase efforts in respect of the instrument of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="de">My answer to the second question is that I am not in favour of banks being rescued unconditionally. What we actually have to achieve in the banking union is not just supervision, but also intervention, influence on what has gone wrong in the banking and financial sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly let me also congratulate Spain on their great victory on Sunday night. Clearly, Germany is not the most competitive European country at everything. Of course at least, it allows Spain to boast of some success from the Euros – well they are certainly more successful than France were at the games, anyway.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we look under the surface of last week’s summit, we find that, in reality, the decisions taken were, of course, just another set of short-term stopgaps. Perhaps they relieve the immediate pressure points but it was hardly the game-changer that the Irish Prime Minister claimed. Using the bank recapitalisation and buying bonds may give Spain and Italy some breathing space. However, I find it slightly ironic that the same people in this House who want to bash the bankers and propose a financial transaction tax – to punish the bankers at every opportunity – are the same people that are perfectly happy for the risks and profligacy of those same bankers to be transferred on to the backs of taxpayers through these bailout funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Initially, the markets responded positively on Friday – finally perhaps they had seen some signs of life from EU leaders. However, as is usual in these things, already the deal seems to be unravelling. Countries like Finland and the Netherlands are challenging the new roles for the bailout funds that they seemed to have agreed to in the summit on Thursday night. When the dust has settled, the small print is read and the details are finally discussed, I fear that the outcome of this summit could be far less seismic than many in this House want to believe.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is because, yet again, the fundamental questions have not been answered. The lack of competitiveness of many countries has not been addressed. The possible mutualisation of debts has yet again been avoided. Relying on the ESM and the EFSF is no long-term solution to this crisis because they are not bottomless pits of money with the power to grant our every wish. If they are being committed to bank bailouts and used for secondary bond purchases, will there, in fact, be anything left over for the sovereign bailouts for which, let us remember, they were originally, intended?</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us not pretend that even this relatively small shift in German policy was arrived at with great harmony. Even for these few small concessions, it seems that Italy had to hold the proverbial gun to Germany’s head. In reality, what we saw in the Council highlighted that, even for countries in the euro, the mentality is still one of maximising national interests. Now do not get me wrong, I fully support national governments fighting their corner, but let us also be clear that the euro was never a tool aimed at helping countries to defend their national interests. As Margaret Thatcher remarked in 1990, the single currency is about the politics of Europe. It is about a federal Europe by the back door.</p>
      <p sl="en">The great irony of it is that this very tool that was intended to unify the peoples of Europe is, in fact, now driving them further apart, because it was always inevitable that permanent fiscal transfers would be required from the north to the south, with Germany acting as the paymaster of less competitive countries. It was also inevitable that we would see the supranationalisation of economic policy, effectively rendering national democracy defunct within the eurozone. In the future, will there, in fact, be much point in holding elections in many eurozone countries if their budgets and fiscal policies are going to be rewritten by Brussels every time? This is not a small point that should be brushed under the carpet; it is a fundamental issue of accountability of government to the peoples in their own democracies.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the moment, we face an impasse: Germany wants to supplant economic policy at EU level; the Mediterranean countries want Germany to underwrite their debts. I am reminded of the story of the two politicians. One says to the other, ‘OK, let’s be honest with each other’; the other one says, ‘all right, but you first’. Inevitably, someone has to move first – but let us never forget that there is an alternative. It is for the eurozone to reduce in size so that some countries have the ability to devalue their way back to relative competitiveness. That would be a political disaster for the euro’s cheerleaders, but for some countries, it remains the least worst option and a possible way out of this crisis.</p>

It is not me who wants to give them unlimited amounts of taxpayers’ money to bail them out from the costs of their own profligacy.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Callanan’s opening remarks have made me consider something. There is one reason why I am pleased that Germany did not get to the final, because if you continue with this analogy, it suggests that whoever becomes European champions becomes one of the most indebted countries – Greece in 2004, Spain in 2008 and 2012. I do not know what would have happened in Germany, but I am glad we have been spared that fate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Van Rompuy, at the end of the G20 summit, you stated that the economic union should exist by the end of the year. These were empty words, however, which have not been fulfilled even now after the summit. I therefore have to agree with those who say we should stop rushing from one summit to the next, and that we should ensure, once and for all, that together – and that means the people of the European Union and their directly elected representatives in the European Parliament, the national parliaments and the other European institutions – we talk about what should actually follow and where the journey will lead us. It can only be a joint debate, and it must start now. We need concrete ideas now.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Head of Government’s statement kept talking of a breakthrough. I doubt that it is really a breakthrough. Influenced by election campaigns and elections in Greece and France, those in power have, in fact, decided more or less hesitantly, half-heartedly, or even inconsistently, on greater stability and security, and on the configuration of the European Union. They have not passed the regulatory measures that have been recognised as being needed, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">In short, I would say that the EU, the Member States and also the euro area remain in crisis because there has been no change in their priorities and because there has been no shift away from the path of global competitiveness, neoliberal deregulation and the privatisation of public services and social security systems. Admittedly, there has been some relaxation of the strict line of German austerity policy, in that access to aid funds from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is being eased without the countries affected having to submit additional reform programmes. In this connection, I should like to say that we should be grateful to the Greek population and to the Syriza party and Alexis Tsipras for having drawn attention to precisely this sore point, and we should now renegotiate with the Greek Government in the interests of the Greek population.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the fully announced pact for growth and jobs is still not specific enough and lacks the necessary goals. The revenues required to finance such a programme are limited to the money created by the European Central Bank and to European Investment Bank credit. It is likely that we will have to wait some time before the financial transaction tax becomes effective, too. The other sums included in the EUR 120 billion package seem to have been counted twice. They were already available anyway, and essentially it has now simply been confirmed that these funds will be made available swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The answer to the important question of which investments and spending programmes are to receive these funds promptly remains relatively vague. The idea put forward by the French to use 1% of GNI for such a growth and employment programme does not sound bad in itself, but what is dubious is what Chancellor Merkel highlighted at the press conference, which is that it is to be used mainly to promote public private partnerships. In other words, what we are selling as an employment programme is ultimately also a programme to maximise the profits of private companies and corporations. In the final event, that will only make it more difficult to introduce concrete regulation of the financial sphere. In doing this, we are putting the next stumbling block in place for ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, that is the 19th crisis summit that Mr Cameron has been to. As the Rolling Stones might say, the 19th nervous breakdown, and that is reflected I think by the funereal mood in this Chamber this morning.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, on that Friday morning ‘breakthrough’ was cried, and indeed Mr Van Rompuy parroted the word this morning: ‘breakthrough’. Nobody believes you. The wheels are coming off.</p>
      <p sl="en">This European Stability Mechanism, your new bailout vehicle, is doomed before it starts. We have legal challenges in Ireland and in Germany. We have the Estonian Justice Minister saying it will not fit their constitution but – most fun of all – the Finns and the Dutch seem to have broken the agreement that was made in the middle of the night. Perhaps they were excluded from this, perhaps the little countries do not have a say in Europe at all any more. It is not credible. The euro crisis now looks to me to be frankly insoluble.</p>

I am sorry, sir: you do not have the presence, the credibility or the standing for the international markets to believe that you can provide a solution. And Mr Barroso here: at the G20, he stood up at the press conference and said that we do not need any lessons in democracy – said the unelected President of the European Commission. I mean, he went on to say that the eurozone’s problems had been caused by unorthodox practices in North America.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Farage is absolutely right. The state of affairs surrounding the ESM Treaty is obviously unacceptable and undemocratic. I will explain to you why that is the case, Mr Van Rompuy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Council has approved two major amendments to the ESM Treaty. Under the first amendment, support will, from now on, be granted directly to banks and will no longer have to go to Member States. The second amendment is that, from now on, loans from the ESM will no longer enjoy preferential status.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Council has thus proposed such a crucial amendment of the text of the treaty that the treaty must be ratified again. The Netherlands is required to contribute EUR 40 billion to this. We are talking about a substantial amount here, namely, more than EUR 5 000 per Dutch household. It goes without saying that such a treaty, with such financial implications, requires a careful ratification process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Our democracy requires that, Mr Van Rompuy. Parliament is currently in the final stages of ratifying the ESM. However, our members have wrongly assumed that no direct bank support was possible. Even the Dutch Prime Minister Rutte has said that it would be undesirable for the ESM to provide direct support to banks. And now, all of a sudden, it seems that that will take place nonetheless. This means that Parliament has been misinformed or Mr Swoboda is perhaps right in saying that Prime Minister Rutte is saying one thing in Brussels to you, Mr Van Rompuy, and another at home. I would like clarification on that, Mr Van Rompuy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Wim Voermans, who is Professor of Constitutional and Administrative Law at the University of Leiden, has also investigated the legal implications of this. Quote: ‘Direct payment to banks is not possible under the current treaty. The treaty would have to be changed and re-ratified’. Unquote. Article 12 of the ESM is crystal clear: ESM stability support may only be provided to ESM Members and, therefore, not to banks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second amendment, too, which means that the ESM loans to Spain no longer have preferential status, represents a crucial change in the conditions of the treaty. Parliament has been put on the right track. To conclude, Mr President: the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is of the opinion that this approach is undemocratic, unlawful and unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that Ms Harms of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is a little tired of comparisons with football, but I think that one in particular might help us. Euro 2012 ended with a clear result: Spain won. The European Council ended but the results are not clear, because if we read the papers in the various Member States, each country is claiming a different result, and each prime minister of the participating Member States is claiming a different result.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Van Rompuy, can you tell us what you agreed on? Do you think that 500 million European citizens have the right to know what you agreed on? Please tell us, President of the Council, but think carefully, because how the markets open tomorrow, too, depends on what you say. Think carefully, because the survival of my country’s government depends on what you say. For a long time, the survival of our countries’ governments has depended on what you say.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think also that 60 million Italians who, via the Prodi and Berlusconi governments, have made budgetary adjustments amounting to EUR 145 billion, and who, via the Monti government, are making sacrifices amounting to several billions of euro, have the dignity and the right to be given precise answers. We therefore want to know, in specific detail, what was agreed in the Council and what obligations there are for the Member State governments, which are today bombarding us with contradictory statements. Is Finland bound? Is the Netherlands bound? Are we bound by what we set out as an agreement or not?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, the decision taken in Brussels is a welcome breath of fresh air, and even if there remains a lot to do, the conclusions of this summit mark the end of an era and represent the first stage of a revival for our citizens, that of a Europe that gives itself the means to be fairer and show more solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue of growth is no longer taboo and the discussion about the broad economic guidelines is now under way. The European Union will not be able to emerge from the rut of the crisis without breaking the vicious circle of austerity, which could condemn Member States to an endless recession. I am delighted that this sound political sense can at last be found in the conclusions and I am glad that France and its President, Mr Hollande, have contributed to this political rebalancing and are committed, out of solidarity, to the path of integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, although hope is essential, full implementation is what will restore confidence permanently. With EUR 120 billion having been mobilised within the framework of the Growth and Employment Pact, and EUR 10 billion of recapitalisation from the European Investment Bank (EIB), these will allow bonds to be issued for the purpose of financing projects. The European Parliament must be heard concerning a coherent financial framework and own resources. The mobilisation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the launch of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which we would have liked to see granted a banking licence, is the most urgent matter for Spain and Italy, without forgetting the Greek citizens who have been hit hard by the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The quick implementation of a banking supervisor for the euro area is only the first step towards banking union, which Parliament strongly advocates. Moreover, we cannot content ourselves with a limited tax on financial transactions, even if its implementation within the framework of enhanced cooperation could constitute a first step. In this way, we expect a lot from the next European Council, where the group of four – four Presidents, of course – will have to propose an ambitious road map in order to advance economic and monetary union and to enable the definitive resolution of the sovereign debt crisis and the instability of the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Presidents, this European Council has attempted, for the first time – as you said, Mr Van Rompuy – to have a vision which shifts from the short term to the long term. It is something that we have often called for here and we thank you for this. There are both vital measures concerning the banks and the spreads, and the vision that you have displayed. Point duly noted, thank you. However, there are two tragic contradictions. The first has just been mentioned, in particular, by Mr Mauro: we must be serious with respect to the markets. Whatever you have decided, find an agreement from the outset on its communication. I have a request for you, Mr Van Rompuy, silence them. Silence them! Speak in the name of the European Council. Let us stop this shameless cacophony. What company, human group, family, even, would tolerate the fact that after a meeting, each person goes and talks about who knows what. What is at stake here is the destiny of southern Europe. Mr Van Rompuy. Silence them!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, concerning democratic legitimacy, the last point, but a very important one, regarding your paper: I observe, nonetheless, an enormous discrepancy between the goodwill shown on paper and what happens in reality. The only point on which you have made progress concerning banking union is with regard to supervision. That affects an area in which this Parliament has fought together with the Commission against the Council, which was dragging its feet, in order to have European supervision. Perhaps it is a good thing that the European Central Bank (ECB) takes charge of this, I have nothing against the idea, but, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, this must be debated in a democratic forum. You cannot withdraw competences that were granted to Parliament, and concerning something that we have worked on together.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to address two specific points. It is important that a growth pact has now been decided on by this Council. However, much of it is built on sand. Of the EUR 120 billion, EUR 55 billion is supposed to come from Structural Fund monies. I do not yet understand how this is supposed to be mobilised in the short term without the Member States making additional short-term payments into the EU budget. I would like to hear you state exactly and categorically whether these payments exist – what commitments were made there to allow this EUR 55 billion to actually now flow into sustainable growth?</p>
      <p sl="de">The second question that I would like to ask relates to the banking union. You have proposed that we proceed on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). That means unanimity in the Council and thus also a right of veto for the United Kingdom and other opponents. I can only urge you to make this banking union, but to make it on the basis of the Community method, and that means on the same basis as has already been negotiated here for common banking supervision. The democratic rights of the European Parliament must not be eroded here. I would ask you to proceed on this basis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, welcome to the blackmail zone, better known as the eurozone, but officially now a no-growth zone.</p>
      <p sl="en">The latest European summit was appalling. What we saw was, as the German press wrote, a brutal act of blackmail. Apparently, European integration is all about money while prostituting the word ‘solidarity’. What we perceived was Mr Monti acting as a mob leader to get at easy money. Blackmailing Germany is not difficult. Just refer to the past and their knees will weaken.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ESM Treaty was changed, although many national parliaments had ratified it. So what is now applicable law? We simply do not know. The ESM Treaty is not a treaty, but is it a piece of paper, perhaps waiting for the shredder, or is it, Mr Van Rompuy, a piece of scrap paper? Are you the scrap-paper President?</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Monti made a fatal mistake. He galvanised the sentiment of resentment in northern Europe. People feel fooled, robbed and they will resist. Look at Finland and Holland. In Mediterranean Europe, we spread the feeling that there is access to more money, so the pressure for reform will drop and people will ask: why should we suffer if fresh money is on the way? There is only one solution and it is regaining competitiveness. There is no substitute for it and no short cut to a transfer union. The more you push for a transfer union, the sooner the euro will break up.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, where are our colleagues from the German Christian Democrats? I see hardly anyone from the CDU/CSU. Mr Pöttering has already disappeared. Where are they? They should defend their country, but they are absent. The German press will know. They will write about it so that everybody knows in Germany.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, if we are about to hold the euro area’s funeral, we must admit that you, just like our Prime Minister, Mr Monti, have exactly the right look and physique for the part. This agreement sounds strange. We wanted to send a reassuring message, but this debate shows that it is built on shaky foundations, perhaps on nothing.</p>
      <p sl="it">For Italy, unless the European Stability Mechanism’s role as a panacea is fully supported by the ECB – something that remains to be seen – Mr Monti’s victory will be exactly like Italy’s football win against Germany: a Pyrrhic victory. Perhaps we can be saved from this danger of a future debacle by Our Lady of Fátima, but certainly not by your indecision, uncertainty or by pulling the wool over our eyes.</p>
      <p sl="it">Is what came out of the corridors of your summit true or not? Namely, the fear of Heads of State or Government that there will be a massive collapse in the banking sector which holds billions of derivatives thanks to your inattention, to tax havens, to everything that you allowed to happen. Why then, are you not straight with us about the heart of this problem: not state securities, but the great banking and financial collapse of the derivatives market, of financial speculation, given free rein by a certain world of finance that rules in Europe, and unfortunately also in my country now? Shame on you!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is simply grotesque. The wrong European monetary policy produces a crisis, and the 19th crisis Council then decides that the solution to the crisis is more Europe. That means that an incorrect policy is now, so to speak, to be further institutionalised by a fiscal union, an economic union, a political union, a kind of remodelled EUSSR. All of this is down to the paper from this gang of four which is preparing a cold coup and wants to be a crisis profiteer, namely, a political profiteer from the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tell me what solidarity is supposed to mean in the European currency area. Solidarity means transferring prosperity from the countries with a positive balance to those countries that cannot manage to balance their budgets. Tell that to the people, and then we will see what the people say about it. If you want democratic legitimisation, these people will tell you that they reject it, because they are not prepared to accept the liability for banks and their speculative activities.</p>
      <p sl="de">The pact for growth and employment is a mishmash of slogans – slogans and catchphrases that have been heard from summits plenty of times before. Neither I, nor other people in Europe, therefore have any confidence that you will solve this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, have to say that I had got a somewhat different impression of the conclusions of the summit from reading the newspapers from my own and other countries yesterday and the day before. This morning you, Mr Van Rompuy – and you more than Mr Barroso, in fact – have dashed those hopes and have cast doubt on a solution that had been touted in the papers and all the statements as a turning point, a new approach and a chance for Europe to rebuild and restore real confidence.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with Mr Barroso that it is a very important basic principle to make it clear in the various statements and in the final document that monetary stability in a modern economy can only lead to financial stability. Someone called it an historic statement; I see it as a basic premise to start from.</p>
      <p sl="it">If the state bailout fund gives the virtuous countries that have access to the fund the chance to recapitalise, then there is a real prospect, a real possibility. The term ‘possible’ dominates the final document; of course I join those who are laying a huge responsibility on your shoulders right now. In your reply, you must explain effectively and decisively whether the Member States can really put plans into action and be confident that it is not merely a general, abstract reversal of a trend that is not going well and is not enough for the markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">Everyone is said to be making do because we need to reach the end of the tunnel. I believe we are a very long way from the end of the tunnel and so, as regards putting plans into action, we had imagined that all the uncertainty of the previous year in Europe might be swept away by a real, effective decision to be reached at the Brussels Summit. Should we feel disappointed on this point? Should we wonder why it has not come true? Please tell us, Mr Van Rompuy, so we can avoid all these misunderstandings.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Council last week showed signs – although they are still only signs – of a positive change of course towards a more balanced, fairer and therefore, potentially, more effective response to combating the crisis; a response that will really make it possible to combine austerity with growth, which is essential.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament had already made this change of course a few months ago, and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament had made it a couple of years ago. We therefore welcome this new course.</p>
      <p sl="es">This Council is seeing, and will see, in my view, the decline of the high-handedness of the two leaders’ pact and of the dogmatic high-handedness of those who have simply proposed tough measures and punishments and have not in any way taken into account their social consequences. This decline of high-handedness does, in fact, represent a return to reality. The reality is that, without growth, there will be no jobs, and we now know that unemployment is at the highest level the European Union has ever seen.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reality is that, without growth and jobs, the social crisis will explode and the legitimacy of the European project will collapse. Let us therefore ensure that the signs that the Council is showing become a reality in the coming months, let us support the countries making real sacrifices, such as Italy and Spain, and let us put pressure on those countries which, having made a decision, are now throwing up obstacles: Finland and the Netherlands.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a massive crisis of confidence, and therefore expectations of the last summit were relatively high. The summit was scarcely any different from earlier summits, with one exception: seldom have the negotiating tactics – which sometimes bordered on blackmail – and the differences between the negotiating partners been played out so clearly to the outside world as this time. In the end, agreement was reached on Friday morning.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it turns out that, when it comes down to it, the consensus reached was only a formal compromise, which was then called into question again just 72 hours after being reached. The Dutch and the Finns have already announced that they do not support the buying of government bonds on the secondary market. The markets, which had, until then, reacted positively, are now also beginning to question and smear the result.</p>
      <p sl="de">I expressly welcome the fact that it was decided at the summit to get serious about creating a real banking union. If we have a common economic area and currency area, then we also need a genuine functioning internal market for financial services. Naturally, that includes bank supervision, but it also includes a banking resolution and rescue fund, and ultimately it also includes a deposit guarantee system.</p>
      <p sl="de">All that will take time, and I hope that the European Parliament will be adequately taken into consideration at least in the first step, the construction of supervision at the European Central Bank, and things will not continue as they have done recently.</p>
      <p sl="de">This summit was definitely not the great breakthrough. It was not a great act of liberation. The citizens are just as uncertain as before, and I fear that we will continue to muddle along. I can only hope that we have enough time in which to find the ultimate solution.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, if it really is believed that stronger centralisation of government and decisions is the only way for Europe to survive as an economic and financial Union, then communities and nations should be immediately informed about this so that they can decide themselves about relinquishing part of their sovereignty. I doubt whether talk of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) and the review of the Savings Tax Directive is the way to overcome the crisis. The European doctrine for overcoming the crisis should be built on three pillars: firstly, the promotion of production and adequate consumption; secondly, savings not at the expense of public revenue but bureaucratic state apparatus and state banking sector spending; thirdly, effective use of European Union funds, also for critical social reforms.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this summit marks the first steps for Europe towards a banking union, and the potential recapitalisation of banks with difficulties in those countries presently in turmoil, such as Spain and Italy, is definitely a step forward. Direct aid from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to the banks can only take place once a European banking supervisor has been set up. That is also a step forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Despite this, Mr Van Rompuy, let us not be naïve. Some crucial issues remain unresolved. We will still need a good many more EU summits in order to try to provide the answers of economic and monetary integration in the euro area, put simply, political integration. For we cannot guarantee a growth model that is based on public spending without the consolidation and cleaning up of public finances. There cannot be financial solidarity without budgetary, fiscal, and social harmonisation. The premise is simple: we do not pay off debt by creating more debt. We know that by pooling the debts of countries that do not have the same economic and budgetary policies, we will endanger some Member States by committing them to guaranteeing debts that they do not control.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, I hope that France will very quickly ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which was signed last January and could not, of course, be renegotiated. However, Mr Monti has operated very well. However, it should strengthen the bonds of trust between Member States, since it is not desirable to provoke them, nor is it desirable to strongly oppose Germany. It serves no purpose. The Franco-German psychodrama is not in anyone’s interest and this is not the best way to address Europe’s future at this difficult time.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, the summit has turned around the debate. However, Mr Van Rompuy, the Member States have not yet dared to make the leap. Indeed, it is a major breakthrough to say that we want to make the European Stability Mechanism more active. That is only right and proper. If we do not, we will not really be able to halt the crisis. However, it is also entirely clear to me why the first Member States are already backing off again, why the first heroes of their troops are already disappearing back into the bushes. Why? It is because they forgot to clarify how the stability mechanism would be financed so as to be able to afford this.</p>
      <p sl="de">That takes us to the problem at the heart of this debate. Europe faces a challenge. We will only overcome the crisis if we are able to make a great qualitative leap: more Europe, better ways of working and more joint action. However, we cannot make a run-up to this great leap while at the same time slamming on the brakes. That is what is constantly demonstrated by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can also say, as regards the second topic, that it is right to say that we want to create a programme for growth. The growth programme is essential. You have opportunities to do so, Mr Van Rompuy, as does Mr Barroso. Simply show us the figures, however, for how much this growth programme can generate. Will it be 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.6% of gross national income? What will it cost to implement the rules of the fiscal pact, which are still too rigid? Perhaps 1%, 1.5%? What is the bill? We need to do more in this direction if it is to work.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week’s meeting demonstrates once again that EU leaders only take decisions when they have a knife held to their throat. In many ways, we could say that last week’s decision paves the way for a positive development in which those countries with economic problems will have time to adjust. That is all very well. At the same time, the meeting left a number of open questions that have also been discussed here in the Chamber today, and it is clear that there are those who choose to interpret the meeting’s decision in a way that will come across as opportune to their home public.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is understandable for political reasons, but it is regrettable all the same. For example, it has been implied that an agreement has been reached to the effect that the rescue fund is later to operate on the so-called secondary bond market. As far as I understand, this is not the case. If it were the case, it would certainly be stated very clearly in the minutes of the meeting, and it is not.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With an eye to the future, I believe that it is wise to stick to what we have actually agreed and not make a whole lot of digressions and interpretations, as this will only lead to those countries that are already standing there with their purses open distancing themselves even more from the decisions, and that is not desirable in a situation in which we are making joint sacrifices in order to get ourselves out of this difficult economic situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, important steps have been taken in the right direction and growth packages welcomed, and stabilisation measures for the euro debt crisis are coupling both flexibility and conditionality. The move towards banking union is to be welcomed, and the road map for genuine monetary union is a good starting point. However, closer integration should preserve the unity and integrity of the Union of 27 and its single market. Agreed initial measures – some would say half-measures – should evolve into full measures of banking, fiscal and political union. Measures addressed to the EU of 17 only – some would say half-union solutions – should evolve and be open for all members, at least those which are willing.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should avoid being satisfied with half measures for a half Union. We should not accept the logic of differentiation and a two-speed integration of the EU. Eurozone ‘ins’ and future ‘ins’ are, and should remain, in the same boat. Only those who opt out should practise derogations. Advanced integration of 17 at the expense of the disintegration of 27 is not an acceptable solution. We need an inclusive, not exclusive, format. We should preserve and cherish a single institutional framework and avoid having 17 restricted institutions in parallel, separate for ‘ins’ and ‘pre-ins’, resulting in interinstitutional cleavages. We should avoid dual-level solidarity, two parallel budgets and double macro-economic standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Collateral political damage done to the European project by half-Europe anti-crisis measures would be great. There is huge potential for growth in the EU maintaining integral economic and political unity. Unravelling this unity will not bring us closer to winning the battle with the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus is usually on the pre-summits when the summits themselves count for nothing, but in this case, we are forced to focus on the post-summit because we had understood that something important had happened. Mr Van Rompuy, if you had gone into a national parliament in any country in Europe and made the speech that you made here today, I think people throughout Europe would have understood precisely the opposite of what they had read in the newspapers three days ago, that you had made Europe take a giant step forwards.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it is essential to come here to this House not only to tell us what happened at the summit, but also to say what the Council intends to do after this summit. If you do not tell us that, you will be throwing away the chance to tell the European public that we are working towards a united Europe and to getting a step closer to rescuing the countries in difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="it">In your reply, Mr Van Rompuy, I would also like you to tell us exactly what you think of the position taken by the Dutch and Finnish Governments. It is your duty to say what your thoughts are on that, because otherwise we will have the impression that the Council ended with a statement that does not correspond to any genuine political will.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it has been said that, in order for things to get better, sometimes the chaos needs to get worse. The feeling of powerlessness was such that Europe was forced to react, and it did so for the good of everyone, because the big winner of this summit was the euro. This triumph has revived the hope that Europe is emerging from its paralysis, moving from thought towards action. Ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to adopt short-term measures at this summit, in order to guarantee financial stability, along with long-term measures, in order to solve the Union’s shortcomings. In this case, immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important. The imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint, irrevocable and irreversible project.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome such important decisions as giving the European Stability Mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly, which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; incidentally, the current Spanish Government has always advocated this theory. It will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments. These decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability, which must be the European Union’s highest priority in the short term.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles. As I have already said, it is the time to support Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is providing and implementing, in record time, the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Spanish democracy, which includes major employment reforms. It is also carrying out a financial reform, based on complete transparency, all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration, using four building blocks: banking union, fiscal union, a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the history of first the Community and then of the European Union has always shown that, not only do we overcome crises, but also we emerge from them stronger. I am delighted that, once again, we have achieved this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, the last meeting of the Council seemed finally to be starting to go in the right direction, but some details are lacking, and without them, nothing can be concluded.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the first place, it is good that it is finally being recognised that budgetary discipline is only effective if it is accompanied – not followed, accompanied – by growth and employment. However, the growth and employment initiative will only yield results if it is able to correct the internal imbalances within the EU, which are the cause of the crisis. It will only be effective if it opens up employment and business opportunities, in particular, for economies that have repeatedly lost out with the functioning of the internal market and the single currency, and if it contributes to emerging from the crisis, above all, for those countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Second, it is good that breaking the spiral of contagion between Member States’ debt and that of the banks is now central to the agenda. While there are new proposals, it is not politically acceptable for banks in crisis to end up benefiting from greater European assistance and less stringent restrictions than those imposed on the Member States. Banks and Member States can hardly compete for access to the same public funds, especially if such funds are clearly inadequate, as is the case with the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If a bank fails, it should not be the case that the taxpayers pay more than shareholders, nor that bank resolution funds come predominantly from the public purse, rather than from the banks themselves. Finally, depositors should not have their savings in euro put in jeopardy by the crisis. It is vital to ensure that this is all made impossible as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One last thing, before I finish, Mr President: the key thing is missing, namely, ensuring that the Member States do not meet their ends at the hands of the markets. The proposals that Parliament has tabled in the so-called ‘two-pack’ on protecting sovereign debt are absolutely crucial to the survival of Europe at this time. I hope that the Commission and the Council will respond favourably to Parliament’s proposal on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to say a couple of words about the questions that have been put to me.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, about the report on the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union. We will be coming up with a report on this in October and December. It is my intention to talk in October mainly about what can be implemented from the existing treaties. In that sense, it is not really an interim report. It is interim because it is a stepping stone to possible treaty changes. However, it is important in itself because what we can do within the framework of existing treaties can, in itself, be valuable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We need to discuss with the President of Parliament how we can organise cooperation between Parliament and those who are responsible for drawing up the report, that is, the Presidents of the four European institutions. We will be getting in touch with them about that soon. It goes without saying that I am ready, as we have done in the past – I am talking about the report on the task force – to cooperate intensively with Parliament on that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If I have talked about there being a breakthrough, I did so in one specific sense, and I usually express what I want to say quite carefully, even if I am quoted wrongly afterwards. That does not mean, though, that I am going to correct every wrong quote; I am not going to take up my time with that. If I spoke of a breakthrough, what I was referring to was the fact that we can agree on single banking supervision, that we have decided that we can agree on single banking supervision in the context of the recapitalisation of banks in a direct way through the European Stability Fund.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, I consider such a breakthrough towards a single watchdog as one of the Council’s main achievements last Thursday and Friday. At the same time, this is the first stage of implementation, if I may say so, of the report that the President of the Commission, I and two other colleagues have put forward in connection with the deepening of economic and monetary union. Thus, we can talk of a breakthrough in that specific sense.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to the decisions made by the Council and the summit about the euro area, well, these decisions are always taken unanimously. There can be no decisions other than unanimous ones. That is, unfortunately, the kind of decision making we have – some find that a pity, others a good thing. We have taken decisions unanimously. I assume that these decisions, too, will be respected. These are times of responsibility. We are going through a very deep crisis that has dragged on for a long time and that we are trying to overcome step by step. Everyone, each member of the Council, each country must take its responsibility, especially when it comes to the implementation of decisions taken unanimously. Fortunately, on one specific point, the new emergency fund, the ESM, provides, in such a decision-making procedure, that no single country or, in some cases, even a group of countries, can alone block decisions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In any case, I would like to thank you for the debate we have had in the sense that we have, unlike on other occasions, effectively said on a number of points that we have made progress. The major work remains still to be done when it comes to the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union. However, I understand that a very strong agreement is possible on the big picture, the building blocks, at least between those who have written the report and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You know, however, that we live in a Community, in a Union of 27. We must all reach agreement on this. That requires effort and also implies that a step-by-step approach is the only possible way to get ahead, whether we like it or not. As I have said, though, I consider the most recent Council meeting last Thursday and Friday as a step forward in the right direction. I wish to thank all of you who have confirmed that.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr Van Rompuy, perhaps I could make a comment, if you will allow me to do so, since you are still here. I consider it only right that you are telling us that you want to work closely with the European Parliament on the follow-up of the proposal that you, as President, submitted to the four institutions. On behalf of this House, however, I have to remind you of two things.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Firstly, it was a mistake that you did not invite the European Parliament from the outset. Secondly, the European Parliament has greater legitimacy than the European Central Bank to speak for the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I therefore assume that the President of the European Parliament will be invited to participate equally in such work in the future. We can decide among ourselves how we work at working level, but I would say to you – not personally, but on behalf of this House – that it is not acceptable for there to be two different types of European institution: those that meet together there, and us. We are the deciding European institution and I therefore demand, on behalf of this House, that you invite me to participate in this work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the outcome of the summit was balanced. The principle of control and liability was maintained in the short-, medium- and long-term measures, which take us in the right direction to solve the crisis, to control the crisis, and which also sent out a clear political signal that this European Union still stands together and will not allow itself to be driven apart by the crisis. That is the most important message.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore consider it a good thing that now, for example, we are creating a banking union, and I assume that the Commission will table a legislative proposal for this swiftly and that this will also be associated with more flexible use of the European Stability Mechanism. These two things, however, belong in a particular context. We have to make it clear that this is not merely a sovereign debt crisis, but a financial crisis that has driven the sovereign states into debt. This must also become clear while giving particular consideration to the financial sector and its regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am of the opinion that on matters of institutional development, in particular, the paper that Mr Van Rompuy submitted along with Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker and Mr Draghi takes us in the right direction in the medium and long term, and from Parliament’s point of view, I would like to thank Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso in particular, as well as Mr Juncker, for their helpful work.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must be clear that the crucial thing in the future remains the Community method, with the full involvement of the Community institutions. It must be made clear that we cannot allow the crisis to result in an institutional split in the European Union between the 17 on one side and the rest on the other. It has to be clear that, in this, the European Parliament is the parliamentary assembly at European level and that the national parliaments and the European Parliament are constantly strengthened at their respective levels. I would also like to thank you for the fact that it was expressly pointed out that cooperation takes place between the national parliaments and the European Parliament based on Protocol 1 to the Treaty of Lisbon. That is the appropriate line, and this provides a good basis for it. I would like to express once again my warm thanks for the cooperation on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe stands before one of the most difficult challenges ever: to get out of the worst economic crisis of the post-war period and, at the same time, take the European project forward. This is not an easy task; if it is to succeed, the EU and its Member States must start conducting a more balanced economic policy – single-minded austerity is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU must also seriously attack the problem that, for decades, we have set aside insufficient resources for growth-enhancing investments. Therefore, I am very happy with the broad support for my report on project bonds, to be issued tomorrow. I am also happy about the European Council conclusions on the Compact for Growth and Jobs and the detailed guidelines for the Union’s own actions and budget in this context. EUR 55 billion will be devoted to growth-enhancing measures in the current period.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is still a question mark: to have concrete effects on the ground, the EU budget will need payments. These EUR 120 billion, with very concrete proposals for EUR 55 billion, must lead to concrete projects with rapid effects on jobs and growth, particularly in the most vulnerable regions in Europe. But for that to happen, the Council and the Member States must change their rigid position on the payments level in the European Union budget, because otherwise – unfortunately – this will be another round of empty promises.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Council’s decision on the Compact for Growth and Jobs is extremely positive. However, its success depends on its implementation. No concessions must be made during the process of implementing the specific recommendations for each Member State. Member States must implement the single market legislation urgently. The procedures for approving the redeployment of the Structural Funds must be implemented as quickly as possible to achieve a rapid result. On the other hand, the notion of a two-speed Europe must not be supported in any form. All Member States must apply, in one way or other, the measures on economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, the conclusions from the European Council on the MFF are not satisfactory. The Danish Presidency did not make the expected progress on a matter which is of paramount importance to the EU’s future. There is not even a forecast for the size of the European budget. The negotiation boxes do not include what the European Council should have proposed, but references to the very important aspects of the horizontal policies which come under the codecision procedure. Such an approach, which can only lead to Parliament deciding against the MFF 2014-2020, is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I expect the Cypriot Presidency to amend this approach and urgently initiate discussions with Parliament. Parliament has already made its position very clear in the report from the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges, which the Council must take into account. If we look at the conclusions, there is a huge discrepancy between the conclusions on economic growth and jobs and those on the MFF. Ninety-five per cent of the European budget is targeted at investment, which generates exactly what is desired: economic growth and jobs.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the decisions by the European Council are, of course, a step in the right direction, but clearly a great deal still needs to be done before these general undertakings can be translated into specific, reliable and effective decisions and acts.</p>
      <p sl="el">I wish to raise two points: the first concerns the financial transaction tax. The European Parliament would obviously prefer a decision to be taken at EU27 level. However, as that appears to be impossible, we feel that the conditions and requirements should be put in place as quickly as possible for those who can and want to move forward, via enhanced cooperation, while respecting the basic characteristics of the tax, which should apply to as many financial institutions as possible and cover as broad a range of financial transactions as possible. The European Parliament supports the financial transaction tax, not stamp duty.</p>
      <p sl="el">My second point concerns the decision taken by the European Council, and not a moment too soon, to break the vicious cycle between the banking sector and the debt crisis. This is a good beginning that should apply to everyone, regardless of why the banking sector has been recapitalised in each country.</p>
      <p sl="el">May I ask you, Mr Barroso, to assure us today that this principle of equality and justice will apply and that every country which is in a programme and is demonstrably applying it can expect such equal treatment in this matter?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to simply state the following: I believe that for us, all of whom believe in Europe, this Council was marked by two pieces of good news. The first is that we have more time and the second is that we have been given reason for some hope. However, I believe that the results are meagre. We could and should have gone much further, but the fact is that, for the first time, I believe that steps have been taken in the right direction, in a clear way. Moreover, they have been framed within a kind of road map.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also congratulate the Commission, as the fact is that, at summit after summit, Council after Council, proposals presented a year and half, two years or six months ago, which had been rejected no sooner had they been presented, have finally been adopted. In spite of everything, as the Commission itself is behind this road map, a road map for greater integration, I have some hope – that is why I used the word ‘hope’ – that some of the proposals made by the President of the Commission and some of those that he made in conjunction with the Presidents of other institutions might be followed and might finally put us on the path to greater stability and security for the times ahead.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, it is a political success that after so much travail, a constructive direction has been set for the EU in the spirit of the founding fathers. It is a political failure, however, that contrary to the spirit of the founding fathers, it is not offered to all EU citizens. This is how it could transpire that on Monday, the Hungarian Prime Minister recounted the summit to the Hungarian Parliament as follows: Hungary has won, and the EU has bowed to Hungarian economic policy. It is disappointing that while Gyula Horn, who will be turning 80 years old tomorrow, had the strength to cut through the Iron Curtain while standing in the shadow of two world orders, you are silently assisting in the erection of a new Iron Curtain. It is disappointing that you, the leaders of the major powers that came out as the winners of the greatest political and economic transformation since World War II, are unwilling to recognise the consequences. If the dream of a united Europe is replaced by another bipolar world order, the consequences could be tragic and unpredictable. Our political responsibility to preserve and further enhance peace is universal and indivisible. This is what I would like to remind you of after the summit.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, in keeping with its tradition, the European Parliament must say, as it does every time, that it is not happy with the Council decisions: that it wanted more, that it wanted a bigger step.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, if we consider the essence, there can be no doubt that the decisions taken are positive decisions, especially the agreement on growth and job creation, which suffices in order to focus on specific ways and means of stimulating growth so as to achieve the results we had with the Lisbon guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="el">The decisions on the debt crisis and the recapitalisation of the banks, which appear to be of interest mainly to Italy and Spain, are also important decisions. However, these decisions should concern every country applying the programme agreed on equal terms, such as Greece, given that it would relieve my country from a very hefty EUR 50 billion burden, and would be fair and correct towards the new government that will be called upon to apply the agreed programme.</p>
      <p sl="el">The financial transaction tax is also important in addressing the problem, as is the use of enhanced cooperation, as there are some countries that do not want it. However, this is the wish of the European Parliament, which has repeatedly said as much, and it is massively important, given that it could be linked to the European Union’s own resources.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the results of the summit have set my mind at rest, as it seems that Europe’s future growth is secure. And it will cost only EUR 120 billion. Of this, half will come from the European Investment Bank and we will find the other half in the Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="sk">What does it matter that some countries will not receive anything from the first half. For example Ireland, despite ongoing reforms, will not be able to apply for funds from the European Investment Bank, as its rating and the rating of Irish banks do not meet the conditions to qualify for a loan. And there are perhaps other examples as well.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, what is worse is that all the funds intended to boost growth are earmarked for cofinancing projects. That is to say, they count on the financial support of the Member States and/or private investors, such as banks. It is because of this that the Member States and the banking sector now have the biggest problem with funding.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Mr Barroso, I would therefore ask you to confirm once again that the better future of the European Union is already in sight. Because if not, then the whole pact for growth is only a symbolic gesture, and I believe that the accountable European politicians should not make gestures, but should instead seek realistic solutions to the problems.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have three points to make. First of all, I would like to congratulate the President of the European Council, as well as the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank, for the position paper on the Economic and Monetary Union which they prepared together for this summit.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is excellent that the position paper makes a choice for a fully-fledged banking union, a budgetary union and economic union because it shows that you are working together for a sustainable solution. That is the only way to eliminate the centrifugal force that has been putting our system under major stress for years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, I would also like to congratulate the President of the Council – though somebody will have to pass this message on to him – on the specific results that came out of the summit. Thanks to them, this summit really was one where we won back ambition, ambition which can form the basis for winning back trust in Europe. The country-specific recommendations, the Compact for Growth and Jobs and, above all, a single supervisory framework and the decision to break the vicious circle between banking problems and national budgets give hope. Hope, Mr President, that we can now work on a road map with just as much ambition, conviction and dynamism towards genuine economic and monetary union and a strong European Union, because we need both.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, it has struck me – as some Members have already observed – that the President of the Council is particularly interested in democratic legitimacy. I would like to thank you, Mr Van Rompuy, for the comments you have made on this score and I have nothing further to add to that. Mr Van Rompuy will now surely recognise that he has a loyal partner and a solid ally in us in order to move towards a strong Europe, sticking together, responsible inwardly and strong outwardly in order to defend our values globally.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the steps towards banking union which came out of this meeting. I also welcome the steps on bank borrowing.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fairness, I say to the President of the Commission that Ireland’s position does need special attention. I do not think that we should ask any Member State to carry an undue burden and, where there is responsibility, there must be solidarity. I want to thank Anna Záborská for what she said in support of Ireland and the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome also what was said by President Van Rompuy when he spoke about mastering this step by step. This is not easy when you need unanimity, but this makes the case for more Europe, not more intergovernmentalism.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need right now are the skills of a fisherman, not of a publicist. When you have got a fish on the line, you need the right breaking strength. If you try to land the fish too soon, the line breaks and the fish gets away. If you let the line loose, the fish gets off and the fish gets away. This requires the skills of an angler, not the skills of a publicist. So far, we have done very well in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to see, please, more emphasis on growth, jobs and hope. I welcome the change in emphasis that has come about in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">In time, it is possible if we turn this around that people will look back on Europe and say: that was a golden era. The Berlin Wall came down and we incorporated those Member States into the Union. We did not repeat what happened in the first half of the last century when 60 million people died. The biggest financial crisis came our way and we dealt with it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, two points from the debate. The EMS is composed of taxpayers’ money. That is true. When states borrow from the EMS to capitalise their banks, their taxpayers shoulder the debt in turn. When the banks can borrow directly from the EMS, the banks owe to the EMS; the moral hazard is far less. Decoupling sovereign debt from the recapitalisation of the banks ends the spiral of excessive debt and increased mistrust from markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the growth stimulus package is fine, but we are not reinventing the policies on growth. What is the scoreboard of Member States’ compliance on the Europe 2020 strategy? How far have Member States gone in implementing proposed policies on the Single Market? What about the Services Directive, for instance? Why do we create illusions and false dilemmas for public opinion? ‘Stability and Growth’ is the name of the pact that has existed for years: these are the two faces of the same coin.

The President has mentioned democratic legitimacy and cooperation following the statement made by the President of the Council. We do not have to put up with the decisions either. For each decision, we should table an own-initiative report by autumn containing the existing decisions and our demands.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, last Friday’s decisions really are very important. Certain decisions were taken on banking sector supervision and bank consolidation, something that we discussed a few years ago. To be truthful, even at that time, it was widely known that the banking sector’s activities do not at all comply with any state policies in either the economic or financial field and these decisions are therefore very important. Secondly, Europe today is experiencing not just financial problems, but a problem of solidarity. Today, the European Union is only understood as a means of obtaining additional money and greater benefits for one’s country, and we see that from the actions of certain specific states if we are talking about the legitimisation of the Fiscal Treaty, if we are talking about the financial transaction tax and many other areas, and I therefore wish that the European Union becomes much more cohesive in future.</p>

If we compare both the content and the total amount, we are talking about EUR 120 billion. We note that if we compare this with the assistance that has been given to the banks and bank recapitalisation, we are talking about a risible package. I would very much like the public to get an explanation as to why the amounts for banks are higher, and why there is greater support with far fewer conditions, and why far less is asked for in return. Why is this not being explained to the public? Why is there no explanation as to why, when we talk about assistance, it is the public that is going to pay again?

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, during the summit, the Council focused primarily on the issue of growth, which is undoubtedly crucial for the future direction of the European Union. However, it is extremely important that we finally come to specific solutions following on from discussions and statements, because only these are currently moving us further. It is essential that we have a clear strategy to promote real growth and can create new jobs. It is only through closer integration that we can have a chance to overcome the current crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, regarding the questions put to the Commission, let me just clarify some of the points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, the assessment we made of this European Council was a balanced one. It represented real progress, but much still has to be done. We should be under no illusions: the crisis is far from over and we need to continue our work. In fact, this European Council addressed, at the same time, short-term measures and a vision for the future, and tried to combine the need for stability with growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is false to say that the conclusions are only one-way. In fact, there was also strong emphasis on the need for reform for competitiveness. At the same time, there was recognition of the need for solidarity. It is in this context that we should analyse the results of this European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding growth, as the Commission has been stating, we need to combine structural reforms at national and European level with investment, and a package for investment was thus approved. This was the maximum the Member States could agree on at this stage. Regarding the Structural Funds relocation, let me state that EUR 20 billion has already been reprogrammed, and a further EUR 55 billion will be devoted to growth enhancing measures in the current financial period.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to some of the questions, I would like to say that it is now critically important that all the governments stick to the agreements once they have been made, and ensure that they are fully and swiftly implemented. We will strongly emphasise the need to respect agreements and to implement them. I would like to reassure this Parliament by telling you that the Commission is determined to come up with proposals very soon. But let me remind you that a number of very important proposals are already on the table.</p>
      <p sl="en">These include proposals on key elements of the banking union, deposit guarantees and resolution mechanisms for example. We now hope that, with the stronger consensus we saw in the European Council, we can even go further and reinforce those proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the issues of the Commission proposals, let us be clear; I have to disappoint some of you. The simple fact that the Commission makes proposals does not, in itself, lead to quick agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Maybe this is because there are too many political forces which say one thing in Strasbourg and something else in the capitals of our Member States.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">So, when we are concerned, as some of you expressed the concern today that governments go to Brussels and say one thing, then go back to their capitals and say something different, it is also very important that political parties do not say one thing in Strasbourg and then say a different thing in their capitals.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">One important and interesting point was made by the British Conservatives today, and some kind of satisfaction was expressed with the situation in the euro area. I would like to tell the Conservatives that it is puzzling that you seem to delight in the difficulties of the euro area. This is in stark contrast to the position taken by your leader, Prime Minister Cameron.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">It would be good in terms of accountability to your public for you to say the same thing here that you say in London. The reality is that there is now a consensus, that includes those states outside the euro area, on the need to strengthen the euro area. It would be a mistake, a complete mistake, to try to divide the euro area from the rest of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also very puzzled at the ease with which some of you recommend that some Member States should leave the euro. Once again, this is in complete contrast to the position taken by the British Prime Minister, who explicitly said at the G8 summit in Camp David, for instance, that it was in his national interest that Greece stays in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">So it is very important that we agree on a common approach for the European Union, including countries both inside and outside the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you are suggesting that Europe’s current economic problems are the result of the euro area, and that, for instance, you disapprove of the big bailout programmes in the banking sector in the euro area. Let me just put the facts straight.</p>
      <p sl="en">The country that has spent the most money by far on its banking sector is Britain, more than any other country in the European Union. Let me give you the figures. Since 2008, the United Kingdom has committed EUR 82.9 billion – equivalent to almost 4.9% of GDP – in recapitalisation measures. In asset relief interventions alone, it has committed EUR 40.41 billion – equivalent to 2.38% of GDP – and EUR 158 billion in guarantees, more than 9% of British GDP. So the country in the European Union that has committed by far the most taxpayers’ money to save its financial sector has been Britain. This is not a specific euro area problem; this is a problem that affects the European Union as a whole.</p>
      <a text="(Loud applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">And then I come to my final point: we either solve this together, and we win together, or we will all be defeated together. My final point is this: I did not at all like the atmosphere following the last European Council when I saw some claiming victory over the others.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not the way to do things in Europe: either we win together or we will be defeated together. What we need is a strong European team. It is true that there are in Europe different financial cultures, different perceptions and different sensitivities. But let us be honest; sometimes, this is not a matter of differences between the North and the South – sometimes you find these differences in the very same country.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I am worried when I see some people speaking about the North and the South, making some kind of easy generalisations, because those of us who know European history know how negative a role was played by prejudice and the superiority complex of one part of Europe over the other.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">All the countries of Europe – and some of us have been countries for many, many centuries – have had the greatest moments of glory and very dark moments in our history. We should be humble when we speak about history. And we should not forget that the European project was made precisely to avoid the divisions of the past and the demons that existed in European history.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I do not like it when I see Heads of Government coming out of a European Council and saying that they won against the others. This is exactly the wrong message. This is precisely the road to defeat. The message that we together – the European institutions, the Commission and the European Parliament – have to send is that we are in this together, and together we will be able to overcome this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Sinn Féin welcomes any increase in investment in job creation and reduction in the cost of the debt burden. But the European Council is still not serious about growth. There is only EUR 10 billion of new investment. Austerity remains a key pillar of the EU’s approach to the crisis. Yet the EU continues to pour billions into the banks that are still operating largely unregulated and are gathering billions in personal wealth, storing it far from the reach of the public purse. The failed policy of austerity and bank bailouts to financial vampires who sucked the life blood from our economies needs to end. We need greater flexibility for Member States to implement policies suited to their specific needs, we need investment in jobs to generate economic growth and assist in deficit reduction, and we need debt reduction to enable indebted Member States to return to the markets at normal rates.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The Heads of Government have taken steps to combat the euro crisis: European banking supervision, support to European banks and the buying up of government bonds from the emergency fund. This is nothing short of a major step towards a European banking union. It is unfortunate that the situation in the euro area is such that many economists consider this substantial step necessary. I have three questions for the Council with regard to the outcome of the summit. Firstly, does direct European support to banks not weaken to too great an extent the incentive to the weak euro countries to put their affairs in order, both in the banking sector and in public finances? Secondly, the ESM Treaty. The German Chancellor and the Commission argue that direct support may be provided under Article 19 of the ESM Treaty without renewed ratification by national parliaments of any amendments to ESM. Does the Council take the view that direct support to banks does not require renewed ratification? Finally, to what extent is it realistic to assume that Europe will have an effective system of banking supervision as early as six months from now? That is a prerequisite for responsible spending of money from the emergency fund.</p>

Currently, that support is crumbling at a rate of knots. That is why shock therapy is becoming necessary. The most efficient way we can respond to this is by the direct election of the President of the European Commission. That would be a major step forward. Because Europeans from Stockholm to Nicosia would be able to choose the President of Europe themselves. Let us choose this course of action, preferably as early as 2014. It would trigger a lot of emotion, positive and undoubtedly also negative. However, it will definitely not leave people indifferent. That is an essential part of democracy, is it not?</p>

Specific recommendations have been approved for each country to guide Member States’ policies and budgets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Particular attention must be focused on investments in future-oriented areas as well as on ensuring that pension systems are sustainable. The obvious priority is to increase employment among both genders, and especially among young people and the long-term unemployed. It is important to encourage the redeployment of older workers. The Council will examine the proposals included in the Employment Package and will have to decide on them, with the focus on creating good-quality jobs, structural reform of the labour markets and on investment in human capital.

      <p sl="ro">The analysis of the outcome of the European Council ought to start with the record unemployment rate across the European Union – 25 million unemployed, which is 2 million more than last year. The unemployment rate has passed the 11% mark for the first time since the euro area was established. We can talk about the anti-crisis strategy being successful only when the unemployment figures show a significant drop in the number of job-seekers. For us to judge the situation only based on the extremely capricious vagaries of the ‘markets’ would mean that we are deluding ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I regard as encouraging the agreement on the package of measures worth EUR 120 billion for stimulating economic growth and creating jobs throughout the EU. However, we need to see how this money will be allocated and what type of activities will be funded so as to achieve the maximum economic and social impact. Confidence in the ability of politics to resolve people’s problems is lower than ever. The rise of radical and extremist political movements is a reality, and I believe that the prospect ahead of us is not promising.

      <p sl="pt">This European Council meeting has marked another step along the road to forming a political and institutional framework whereby the EU institutions can impose a steely grip on each Member State, destroying national sovereignties and challenging the most basic democratic principles and values, all in order to intensify exploitation and the attack on the rights and living conditions of workers and peoples, and to prolong the extortion of national resources. The so-called European Semester has closed, endorsing the ‘country-specific recommendations which Member States will translate into their forthcoming national decisions on budgets, structural reforms and employment policies’. If we look at these ‘recommendations’, which the Commission has published and now wishes to implement, we can see the purpose and goals of this European Semester. With regard to Portugal, the Commission advocates lowering wages and reducing the duration of unemployment benefit. This is in a country that has among the lowest wages in the EU, where unemployment has hit historic levels, and where long-term unemployment is on the increase because of the policies imposed by the EU and the IMF. Once again, the interests of the economic and financial groups have taken centre stage, as also shown by the decision on the possibility of giving direct assistance to banks.</p>

      <p sl="it">Finally, after several months spent trying to paper over the cracks – caused by the financial crisis – in the budgets of many Member States, we have officially started talking about growth in the EU again. The package amounting to EUR 120 billion launched by the Council is not only a victory for the Italian Government, which had been pushing for this for some time, but is also an important step for the European economy towards growth and recovery. While not forgetting that out of the total EUR 120 billion, only EUR 14.5 billion is new resources (the remainder consists of reallocations of funds already budgeted), it is significant that the European Union has gone back to using language in line with the expectations of European businesses. Without underestimating the importance of the measures adopted to tackle the financial crisis (such as direct access by banks to State rescue funds as a means to control the spread), the adoption of the growth package must signal a turning point in European policy which complements economic rigour with prospects for growth.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The Socialists welcome the decisions taken at the EU summit as regards the creation of a banking union, the intention to create a financial and political union and the specific measures for job creation. The Heads of State or Government finally showed willingness to act and decided on a range of long overdue steps that the European Parliament and, in particular, the Socialists have been urging ever since the eruption of the crisis. These include recognition of the fact that consolidation of the treasury must be accompanied by an economic policy conducive to growth and investment. It is also welcome that quite a number of Member States voted for the European-level taxation of financial transactions and, indirectly, the promotion of investments aimed at revitalising the economy. The tightened economic, financial and political integration decided on by the euro area Member States must not lead to the European Union splitting in two. It is the national interest of Hungary to have a part in the decision-making process that lays the new foundations of the EU. The Heads of State or Government have finally brought themselves to engage in crisis management. Just as important as the preservation of the common currency is the protection of the fundamental values of the EU. Tighter political integration must be accompanied by an extension of the competence of Community institutions, and not just in economic and financial matters, but also in respect of the functioning of democratic institutions and the enforcement of human rights and the rule of law. The European Parliament, as the only directly elected institution of the EU, cannot be left out of this process.</p>

I think that linking national strategies with the initiatives included in the Employment Package can help improve the situation.</p>

      <p sl="de">The only sensible result of the summit is the planned central banking supervision, for the fact that the banks will continue to receive money in future from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) bailout fund shows once again that the debt crisis in the euro area is, in large part, to do with credit institutions that went to the wall because of irresponsible managers. Despite the fact that levelling everything down has led to disaster, centralism is still being heralded as a cure-all. Italy and France have long been working on forcing the net contributors, particularly Germany, into a debt and liability union. The role of Germany as EU paymaster-general is to be incorporated into the Treaties so that the German economic giant can be permanently subdued. It is a kick in the teeth to the economically successful euro area countries that candidates for bankruptcy will de facto receive funds from the EFSF or from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) without having to make any cuts. If the troika is to exercise no control over adherence to the budgets set, it represents a licence for all kinds of fraud and cheating. The Greek example shows where countries end up if there is not adequate control. The latest summit decisions have opened the way for a debt union, making the flow of money from countries such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands to candidates for bankruptcy such as Spain, Portugal, and perhaps also Italy, a permanent state of affairs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At the European Council in June, ambitious declarations were made about reforming the institutional structure of the euro area. However, only determination in implementing what was decided will demonstrate the Council’s significance in terms of strengthening the euro area. The Member States supported the proposal to establish a single banking supervisor for the euro area. This is a very ambitious challenge, considering both the deadline set – the end of October 2012 – and the protracted process of negotiations on supervisory requirements for the banking sector under the CRD4/CRR legislative package. The arrangements made about the requirements for granting financial assistance to Member States are another important matter. Among other things, it was decided that Italian bonds will be bought using European rescue funds, but without the application of rigorous monitoring programmes. Furthermore, a guarantee was agreed that loans made to Spain from the fund will not be classified as unsubordinated debt, which should increase confidence and demand from private investors in the debt market. The spectacular nature of the declarations formulated at this Council has brought an enthusiastic reaction from the financial markets, despite the fact that the level of rescue capital has not been changed. I think establishing a single banking supervisor and a bank recapitalisation fund will increase financial stability in the euro area. Since we are in a crisis, the new institutions could follow the example of the American federal institutions in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and carry out immediate recapitalisation of financial institutions in order to prevent a knock-on effect.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The decisions made at the European Council meeting last week meant that, at last, important steps were being taken towards more effective crisis management and, at the same time, long-term economic growth. There is a fateful connection between acute crisis management and longer-term measures: neither will work without the other, and both are needed. The decisions served to establish a development in the right direction towards a comprehensive banking union within the EU. It is now time to sever the link between national debt and the debts accrued by banks. It is one that has proven extremely toxic and has encouraged the crisis to escalate. This can be achieved by means of the remedies decided upon by the Council last week. An integrated financial framework and the establishment of a common, robust European Banking Authority both have this particular aim in mind. Such a development does not mean that there should be no limit to the injection of cash made available to the banks in addition to over-indebted countries. On the contrary, this is specifically about the fact that, in future, taxpayers will no longer have to foot the bill for errors or abuse on the part of any one bank, but, instead, the parties liable will be those who incurred the costs in the first place – the banks themselves. It is important that the process starts to be built now, in a logical order and as a workable whole. An essential part of this process must be a banking authority with strong powers that has the wherewithal to restructure banks that have got into difficulties, as well as a Common European Fund, which could be a way to guarantee the protection of deposits and to minimise costs to EU citizens as a result of any possible collapse of the banks. The Commission should comply with Parliament’s demands and propose a legislative package covering the Council’s decisions by the autumn.</p>

      <p sl="hu">We are rightly cautious in our evaluation of last week’s European Council meeting because there has already been a point, in December, where one could have believed that the EU’s descent had stopped. Journalists often exaggerate when evaluating a meeting. It is a crucial point that as a result of this summit, the financial pact is now supplemented with a growth agreement, even if the sum concerned is modest and the manner of its utilisation still requires clarification. Over the next few months, we will need to address issues that were not covered at the summit, such as the introduction of eurobonds. A decision should finally be taken on the EU-wide introduction of a financial transaction tax. This step would provide the EU budget with essential resources and would, at the same time, ensure the regular functioning of the financial markets. Either we are capable of creating a completely new European Union or Europe will forever be marginalised in global competition. In the course of implementing the necessary reforms, we must establish a political union in addition to the economic policy union and must set up new democratic institutional and decision-making frameworks. It is crucial that all 27 Member States be involved in the reform; none of them must be allowed to be worse off as a result of the growth pact. We should urgently set up a European Parliament special committee to reflect on issues concerning the future of the European Union. The European Parliament should review our options for strengthening the democratic legitimacy and institutional and decision-making frameworks of the EU.

We cannot be the architects of the future Europe as long as we are struggling in the clutches of the crisis, and we cannot emerge from the crisis if we do not clearly set out the path along which we want to progress. We will be able to really assess the importance of the decisions adopted at the last European summit only at the end of this year, after the meetings involving Europe’s decision makers in October and December. In October, we will have the interim report on the implementation of the measures agreed last week, while in December, the Heads of State or Government will adopt, based on the final report, the specific timetable with deadlines set for stabilising EMU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the least productive response is for us to look for winners or losers from last week’s summit and to analyse a hypothetical French-Spanish-Italian victory over the much denigrated German inflexibility. I believe that European solidarity must go hand in hand with responsibility from all EU Member States. The way to reduce the democratic deficit is to apply the Community method to counter perpetual intergovernmental rivalry, with Parliament being the institution which needs to take the leading role in this process.</p>

The report by Mr Alfonsi that we have adopted today is of particular importance, especially for the Adriatic region in our country. The macro-regional strategy has a considerable impact both on European planning and on its implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe regional strategies will be extremely important for the implementation of these rules, not least for the sector that I personally am involved with – fisheries – during the revision of our fisheries policies. Unfortunately, this sector is not given due coverage in this report, although that does not make it any less important. Besides, the constraints of the Mediterranean are well known; these constraints in both the management and the implementation of certain policies often jeopardise Europe’s comprehensive strategies. I do not think I can say anything else in all this uproar.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for the report on the evolution of EU macro-regional strategies because its aim is to open up a new area for the cohesion policy in Europe with a very clear objective: territorial development. We are aware that macro-regional strategies need to be based on multi-level governance, which therefore involves the local and regional levels right from the pre-legislative stage.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Both the Commission and Council are expected to give further support to the approach taken with the Danube basin, which must be evaluated regularly and receive suitable financial resources. Last but not least, I support the idea that both the Commission and Member States should consider a process of reflection and consultation for the future macro-regional strategies, so that we ensure that they will really produce substantial added value in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the macro-region as a form of cooperation is useful because it strengthens the consistency and coordination of actions, streamlines the use of financial resources, and enhances the role of local bodies by amply involving civil society.</p>
      <p sl="it">To give an example, the Adriatic-Ionian macro-region involves eight EU and non-EU countries, has the added value of focusing attention on the western Balkans and helping pre-accession countries join the European Union, gives the regions a chance to promote themselves, and speeds up the European integration process. The EU’s recognition of the macro-regional strategy for the Adriatic-Ionian area is an invaluable opportunity to share policies and to draw Europe’s attention to its south-eastern flank.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU has a strategy for the Baltic, a strategy for the Danube and now this report calls for a strategy for the Mediterranean. Soon there will not be a single European body of water without its own strategy. The economies of the Mediterranean from Cyprus to Portugal are in trouble, but are we fools if we believe another strategy will solve the problem? EU regional funding is simply another layer of bureaucracy which is preventing, not promoting, growth in the economy. EU funds are about compliance, not performance, and many regions, including those in the Mediterranean, have been failing to deliver results year after year. And what does the Commission want to do? It wants to increase the budget for regional funds by 8%. There is no value added in this and the main strategy should be to realise the full potential of the single market.</p>

That is why it is important to continue along this path, though subject to certain specific conditions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Macro-regional strategies have to be developed around a well-defined geographical area with specific, uniform characteristics. In addition, strategies must be functional and stakeholders must be willing to push forward the integration process. Essentially, the regional approach should guide local communities towards integration at a higher level in order to address and overcome challenges that they would be unable to tackle otherwise, if they did not cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the Mediterranean area, I think it is important that the report envisages one strategy for the western Mediterranean and another for the eastern basins, in other words, the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. In particular, it is significant that there is already a very high degree of coordination in the Adriatic and Ionian region. I therefore believe the Commission and the Council should follow up this important report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the European Union’s first two macro-regional strategies in the Baltic and Danube regions have materialised, there has been growing interest in this aspect of development. A macro-regional strategy ensures better cooperation among the EU’s various intervention mechanisms, going beyond the appropriations allocated to cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the regions of the Mediterranean basin that share the same natural environment and the same history and culture have every interest in cooperating in this way. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which can best be seized with the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. I am referring to the proposal for an Adriatic-Ionian macro-region in particular.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the successfully operating Baltic Sea macro-region and the related EU strategy are a source of tangible benefits to the entire Union. This is because of the cooperation taking place between partners at national, regional and local levels, which allows clear priorities to be defined and effectively implemented. This cooperation creates a series of opportunities in the area of cohesion policy, and this, in turn, contributes to the success of action taken in the area of services and on work-related issues. Built in this way, the strategy has often allowed greater complementary funding of investments to be achieved, and this has stimulated macro-regional growth. Similarly, enormous opportunities exist in the countries of the Mediterranean. However, the large geographical size of the area means that in order to make use of these opportunities, all the parties involved need to coordinate their policy. The dynamics of development of such a macro-region could be the ideal driving force for the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My endorsement of the resolution means I support the incorporation of macro-regional strategies into the process of planning the budget. I think that measures not covered by cohesion policy are of particular importance here, such as cooperation with non-EU countries. The experience gained from the Baltic macro-region gives us a formula for the development of similar initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean area has always played a major geopolitical role in European history. The latest example, the Arab Spring, has highlighted the strategic potential of the social and political links between the two sides of the Mediterranean. I therefore consider it right to support the implementation of a macro-regional strategy in the Mediterranean basin as the best way of addressing common challenges and encouraging development and integration among its peoples. Although I think the macro-regional strategies need better alignment of funding and more efficient utilisation of existing resources, they are undeniably an essential tool for Europe’s cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on macro-regional strategies, especially with regard to the Mediterranean. Macro-regions have given a good account of themselves, which is why, at an historic time such as this, the Mediterranean, too, needs to be given a major development boost. The Mediterranean can become a place where culture, education, training, tourism, trade, environmental protection, transport and fishing can all come together to make this area take off, in conjunction with the ensuing Arab Spring.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tourism brings wealth, as does trade; education brings democracy and job creation; while culture, with its artists, shows us how we are all united and gives us a view of what we could become.

This way, we can coordinate better and get better results for our people, particularly in relation to the sea, and not just in terms of fishing. We are also looking at the potential of marine energy – which is very important – and the growth of marine tourism, which is a great opportunity for us to get out of the economic crisis and to grow jobs, etc., within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have adopted today proposes the creation of a single working and services area for the maritime, mountain and lake areas of the Mediterranean basin, with the participation of national governments and, above all, local and regional authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">This project rekindles the political ideal of a Europe of the regions, in line with the founding fathers’ original vision for Europe. To highlight the importance of macro-regions, I would like to highlight and bring to your attention an initiative that came about, in part, as a result of the work and ideas of my party’s representatives. It is the agreement to create the macro-region of the Alps, signed in St Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 June by regions belonging to France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The leaders of the three northern Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont took part in the meeting.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope this initiative will soon come to fruition, not least in this Chamber, thereby helping Europe evolve towards a genuine Europe of the people and of the regions. That is the only way to overcome the current financial crisis, to add value to our regions and their special quality products, to revive the economy in real terms, and to fully implement the principle of subsidiarity. That is why I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report and, in this context, I would like to welcome the success of the strategy for the Baltic Sea, the idea for which was born a few years ago in the European Parliament, and which, in spite of three ‘noes’, has managed to live up to expectations. Today, this strategy is one of those examples of how it is possible to cooperate successfully in a macro-economic context. The success of such strategies is firstly based on the initiative of stakeholders themselves, and the need for closer cooperation among the European Union countries concerned. The main common goal is to increase European Union growth and competitiveness and to enhance the European Union’s internal market. As for the Baltic Sea strategy, at this stage, when priority areas are clearly defined and needs and specific projects are set, the Commission should draw up a list of recommended European Union programmes and indicate which programmes will be eligible in the new multiannual financial framework. I believe that a European Union macro-regional strategy coordinator would be a useful consolidating factor, ensuring coordination and visibility. I would also like to stress that these macro-regional strategies do not represent a requirement to obtain more money. They represent a requirement and need for enhanced mutual cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement reached with the Council has resulted in some significant improvements. I am thinking of the establishment of strong, independent national regulators to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to the market, which is one of the key points of the recast; the minimum five-year term for contracts between Member States and infrastructure managers, which will allow for better long-term investment planning; and the major focus on safety, both in terms of rolling stock maintenance, an important distinction being made between light and heavy maintenance, and in terms of the technological modernisation of infrastructure and trains to improve safety (particularly through the European Rail Traffic Management System).</p>
      <p sl="it">In short, the net outcome is positive overall, although one crucial point for the completion of the single rail market remains unresolved, which is the opening up of national rail passenger traffic. I hope the Commission will keep up the momentum it developed a few months ago and will put forward a new proposal in that respect by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am convinced that in creating a single European railway area, we will achieve the following: firstly, a better service for customers; secondly, optimal utilisation of the European corridors; and thirdly, an increase in the competitiveness of the railways. To do this, however, we need a strong regulatory authority that ensures greater competition and makes decisions swiftly. To achieve that, we need to open up the market for national passenger rail transport, and for that we need, above all, technical harmonisation in the areas of power supply, safety equipment and track gauges. On the whole, this is a very positive report that I am happy to support.</p>

      <p sl="it">The rail system still cannot match other means of transport, partly because many Member States have neglected railway funding. We should consider the fact that freight transport by road has risen to 45.9%, with a resulting increase in traffic and, of course, in road accidents as well. The fact is that lorries can cross borders without difficulty, whereas trains encounter technical and legal obstacles that have to be removed. In conclusion, we should ensure fair and non-discriminatory access to the market, while planning investment to modernise and create quality infrastructure and services.</p>

Firstly, it is, of course, important that the national regulatory authorities are networked with each other and that a European regulatory authority also emerges. I would simply like to raise the point that this does not have to take the form of setting up additional new authorities; instead, we can simply network the existing authorities better with each other, because we have enough authorities already.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I should like to point out – as the previous speaker also emphasised – that we need to get serious about the internal market, and we also need to get serious about cross-border rail transport between the Member States. It is high time that we started getting rid of apparent obstacles. The issue of technical standards is generally brought up, and the railways – and thus also our goods and citizens – are not able to move about as freely as they ought to be allowed to.</p>

We should establish transparent rules on access to rail-related services and service facilities, such as freight terminals, maintenance facilities and marshalling yards. Ms Serracchiani’s report is a step in that direction, and that is why I voted for it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of the proposal on a single European railway area. It seems to be quite apposite to consolidate existing directives on European rail policy while moving towards a necessary further liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Current international services in Europe are still often run by complex joint ventures formed for this purpose and requiring unnecessary expenses and delays. A free market in rail services will surely be a boon to the European traveller and haulier. A gradualist model of strengthening national independent rail regulators, with a view to the establishment of a pan-European regulator, is the right approach. I must also say, as a London MEP, that my constituents are eager to see Deutsche Bahn run their ICE 3 through the Channel Tunnel, ferrying passengers from London to Cologne and Frankfurt. They have been disappointed at the bureaucratic delay to this project.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recast of the railway package represents a further step towards the full liberalisation of European railways. I stand with European rail workers in opposing this because it is all about developing the railways into a nice profitable treat for the private sector to gobble up. It runs against the interests of both workers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The so-called rail maintenance facility, for instance, will lead to further privatisation and outsourcing of maintenance in many EU countries. This will lead to further redundancies and further attacks on workers’ wages and conditions. But it will also be a serious threat to safety, as the pressure to keep profits high overshadows any concern for safety. Nevertheless, the EU has been spearheading this drive like an oncoming train, disregarding all legitimate opposition. This is something that the activists of the ‘No TAV’ movement in Italy know about all too well. Thousands upon thousands of people in the Val di Susa have opposed the destruction of their beautiful valley solely in the interests of profits with no benefit for the people in the area. Their movement has been met with massive oppression. One year ago, two thousand policemen attacked a peaceful protest camp, injuring many people. There have been many other incidences of repression since.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted against this report as I find the notion of a single European railway area a ridiculous, unnecessary and unwelcome intrusion into domestic affairs. There is no need for Fritz the Tank Engine or for a single EU Fat Controller for our railways.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that international, rather than regional, agreements are valuable for air and maritime transport, as are single market measures for rail suppliers.

      <p sl="en">When the euro was launched, we were forever being told that we would miss the train and that this was a terrible danger, and we can now see exactly where the train that we missed has ended up.

You could still deflect it on to a different course. You could allow an orderly dismantling of the eurozone and countries to export their way back into the market, but the terrible grisly truth dawning on us is that there is no one in the engine.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have to say, having listened to the previous colleagues, that this should have been a priority in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should have been looking at completing the single market rather than focusing on trying to complete a eurozone without actually getting it right in the first place. Having one currency, 17 different spending decisions, and one set of interest rates was a project that was always going to get into trouble: it would either be derailed or actually hit the buffers. That is what we were going to find that project.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are finding with the single European railway area is a drive towards more competition, and this is what we want to see. We want to see more competition so that passengers benefit from this; they can have a choice of carrier. We should also encourage open-access carriers as much as possible, so that we do not see monopolies of carriers on the same piece of track.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is interesting when we look at this that we are asking for more competition in a single market.

      <p sl="it">I am particularly pleased regarding the amendment that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on joint liability. I believe it should be possible to hold any operator in the transport sector liable for infringements of the regulation in question, and not just road haulage companies and their drivers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The text also calls for smart tachographs to be fitted to all vehicles, old and new, by 2020. This requirement will certainly entail a major effort by companies in the sector, but it is equally important to remain ambitious and gradually install digital tachographs even in those vehicles that use analogue ones.</p>
      <p sl="it">A final critical point is, I believe, the definition of ‘daily working period’. In my view, it is not consistent with other definitions given in existing legislation, particularly with regard to a driver’s rest periods or breaks, which would remain part of the working period according to this definition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am convinced that the smart tachograph will result in greater safety and a reduction in red tape and administrative costs. It will improve safety because driving times will be adhered to and this can also be checked remotely, which will undoubtedly reduce accidents; and it will also improve safety because it will help prevent thefts or enable goods vehicles to be found again by providing location information. I am also convinced that red tape and administrative costs will be reduced precisely because it allows external control and therefore goods vehicles do not have to stop if they are complying with the rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very pleased that there will be exemptions for reasons of practicality, namely, that handicraft businesses will be exempt from the obligation to use a tachograph within a radius of 100 kilometres, and likewise that transport of materials to and from building sites is exempted.

      <p sl="en">There were two problems. The first is in relation to the social rules that have been breached. According to data provided by the Commission, on average, 9% of the controlled vehicles are found breaching the social rules. Roughly a quarter of them are found breaching the tachograph regulations in particular. Secondly, on average, at any one point in time, around 45 000 vehicles are in breach of EU tachograph rules. Non-respect of the minimum breaks, rest periods and the maximum driving times can lead to fatigue for drivers and cause a potential risk to road safety. Heavy goods vehicles are potentially lethal weapons.</p>

      <p sl="en">New technology should, of course, be embraced, particularly when it is aimed at combating fraud, but I cannot agree with the suggestions in this report that extra expenses should be imposed on European transport operators by agreeing to mandatory introduction of new technology without a clear cost-benefit analysis, and by that I do not mean an analysis of people not complying. I mean an analysis of the results of people not complying, which seem to be significantly missing.

On the one hand, I quite understand the notion that drivers should abide by the rules on driving and rest times. I am also aware that this has to happen on an EU-wide basis, and that there must be no distortion of competition as a result.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, however, I am always mindful of proportionality and practicality. Everything that we do must also be proportional, and we must not constantly impose new constraints on regional business, on the little man, on small and medium-sized enterprises – which essentially we want to support – and hinder them in their work. It is precisely this second aspect that I feel has not been given anywhere near sufficient consideration in this report. It is simply a matter of transport undertakings that operate regionally also needing protection. They do not need tachographs, they do not need evidence – they simply want to do a job. In future, we should allow them to do so, so that they can continue to secure jobs.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by improving the harmonised control of driving time and rest periods, digital tachographs can play a vital role in ensuring that the internal road haulage market functions properly, which will greatly benefit road safety.</p>
      <p sl="it">A number of recent police reports from certain Member States have shown that fraudulent use of these devices has risen, and therefore a change to the regulation in force is urgently required. According to the Commission, the increased cost of purchasing a new tachograph is expected to be around EUR 5 per vehicle, which is negligible compared with the potential benefits that could accrue.</p>
      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Ms Ţicău’s proposal because I believe tachographs and vehicle satellite tracking systems should be synchronised to make services more efficient and more reliable.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted against the proposal on recording equipment, namely tachographs, in road transport. I am concerned that this proposal violates the principle of national subsidiarity. I am in broad agreement with the Commission’s goals in formulating the policy generally, especially the attempt to reduce the administrative burden of manual checks, and indeed the safety principles on which previous directives and regulations are based.</p>
      <p sl="en">While, in general, I am unafraid of surveillance measures, this proposal raises serious privacy concerns that are surely best dealt with at national level. The prospect of a remote surveillance organ for the whole of the EU, accountable only to the EU institutions, is a step too far in my view. The Commission’s assurances on data protection are also insufficient, and – as has been pointed out – fraud is an increasing problem. I appreciate that in the field of road transport, some European harmonisation is necessary. However, complete harmonisation goes far too far.</p>

Many have genuine concerns for the viability and sustainability of their business.</p>
      <p sl="en">Hauliers are responsible people and this Parliament should treat them as such. Yet some of what is suggested here seems to treat them with mistrust. The intrusive level of monitoring with the proposal for satellite tracking of vehicles is something I cannot agree with.</p>

There can be no doubt that more people than ever are travelling across Europe and more goods are being transported. Therefore, there is a need for common rules across Europe. Tachographs help here. They were introduced in 1970, we had to amend them in 1985 because of the analogue tachograph, and now we have smart tachographs which hopefully will be fitted to all vehicles by 2020. To use them correctly, however, proper training must be given to the officials who will be in charge of implementing these rules, and that must be done without increasing the red tape one finds all over Europe.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is a German rhyme: Ein kleines Dorf im Frankenland ist durch sein gutes Bier bekannt , which tells of regional pride in a brewery, and this demonstrates a problem that we have created today. If this brewery or its distributor is 107 kilometres away from where I live, then in future, it will no longer be able to supply me with its products unless it buys a new tachograph and complies with new red tape. That is why I voted against this resolution today, because in my view, we should not be overburdening our small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are many points that we have managed to incorporate which were positive. After all, it was planned that a radius of just 50 kilometres should be accepted for regional suppliers. The Commission was being quite absurd there. A distance of 100 kilometres may be just about feasible. However, what if the distance is more than this? I therefore consider it to be excessive.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final aspect: as a representative of an employees’ organisation in the German CSU party, I would also say that this regulation represents complete control of workers. Why? It is because the entire working day of those distributing construction materials or drinks from the breweries is completely controlled via GPS. For data protection reasons, too, therefore, I feel that what we have decided today is highly questionable, and I emphasise once again why I voted against it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as one of the few people in this Chamber to have actually been a lorry driver myself, I voted against this today, even though Mr Higgins has done some good work. There were two main reasons for this. Firstly, it was because Parliament voted in favour of Amendment 134, which lowered the tonnage limit of the vehicles from 3.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes. I consider that excessive; it was not necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above all, in the end I voted against the motion because Amendment 129 was rejected. This amendment called for the radius for approved exemptions to be extended to 150 kilometres. I am from the Upper Palatinate. Munich is 130 kilometres away. My tradesmen work in Munich a great deal, and now they have to install tachographs because they work in Munich. I am particularly annoyed that the only other Member from the Upper Palatinate region, Ismail Ertug, voted against the interests of tradesmen in our region on these two points. I have great hopes that this will be corrected again at second reading, so that tradesmen who work in areas some distance away from their own will not be disadvantaged.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a great pleasure to actually support this draft proposal. I think the six things that it sets out to do are sensible.</p>
      <p sl="en">It sets out, first of all, to broaden the scope of the existing regulation, which needed to be broadened. Secondly, it seeks to maintain the ability for customs to have control, for the purpose of enforcement of intellectual property rights, in all situations where goods are under supervision. Thirdly, it introduces procedures to have goods which have been abandoned destroyed without having to undergo formal or costly legal proceedings. It simplifies the procedure for dealing with IPR infringing goods sold on the Internet and it sets out very clear rules in respect of actions by both rights holders and owners of the goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, it clarifies the position in respect of goods in transit: customs should only act if it is likely that the goods are destined for the EU market. So the new regulation is good. It provides stronger, clearer and modernised legislation which customs administration can implement as part of their role to help cope with IPR infringements on borders.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, intellectual property right infringements and the global trade in counterfeit goods are an ever growing concern, in terms of both the economic consequences for Europe’s industry and the risks to consumers’ health and safety.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament has, for some time, been speaking out on the need to regulate the flow of goods from third countries, which, in the absence of efficient, harmonised customs control, is liable to be the unwitting channel for the traffic in products that are harmful to consumers and prejudicial to fair competition in the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">For some time, I have been calling for the customs systems to be harmonised to make Europe more competitive, a subject that today, at last, lies at the heart of the political debate, together with tax setting. We welcome the Creutzmann report because it simplifies the existing regulatory framework and strengthens the measures used to counter unfair competition.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the Committee on International Trade, we are working on the reform of the customs code in order to provide operators with greater certainty on the destination of goods in transit and to allow for swift action on false statements of origin, a problem that would have been resolved already if the Council had adopted the regulation that this House adopted in October two years ago.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, innovation and the unhindered development of new technologies are possible on the basis of respect for intellectual property rights. Appropriate protection for these rights is essential to be able to compete effectively in world markets and for European products to be able to compete with their foreign counterparts. The cost of piracy – only in financial terms – being borne by European businesses is estimated at over EUR 0.25 billion a year and calls for a determined reaction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, serious consequences to the public may be caused by the sale of counterfeit food items, toiletries and medicines. Recently, we were appalled by the case of industrial salt being used in food products. The report recognises that counterfeit goods intended for private use also break the law. In this context, the measures proposed in relation to small consignments are of crucial importance. The clarifications provided with regard to the treatment of suspect goods from third countries engender hope that a more effective policy will also be adopted when these controversial issues are discussed at the WTO. I support the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have always supported strengthening the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and I welcome this overdue Commission proposal. My country, the UK, is particularly strong in this area. Tolerating the siphoning off of the profits of European wealth creators and inventors defeats the logic of the single market. I hope that the measures proposed will go some way towards furthering the stalled EU 2020 strategy. In particular, I am pleased with the prospective new capacities for involved third parties, such as carriers, to receive compensation from law breakers.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also necessary to increase the legal pressure on copyright violators. Of course, I share the concerns of some Members of this House with regard to generic medicines, but let us not forget the profit motive, on the basis of which most medical advancements are made in Europe by our pharmaceutical companies. My group has previously expressed concerns that additional responsibilities placed on already strained national customs authorities should not be too onerous, so therefore I would hope that any forthcoming amendments will avoid encumbering them more than is necessary.</p>

      <p sl="ga">When one considers that counterfeited goods, piracy, etc. are costing the European Union billions and billions every year, costing us thousands and thousands of jobs, and damaging the health and safety of our adults and children, it is quite clear that we need to take firm action, particularly in dealing with IPR, and at border control. It is far easier to deal with this as goods come into the European Union than trying to do it within the European Union on the borders of Member States. For that reason, I welcome the proposals here.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I consider the issue of intellectual property to be one of the most finely balanced that we have to deal with in this Chamber. It is not as clear as Left or Right; free market or dirigiste; Europhile or Eurosceptic. In all of the areas which come under this broad heading – patenting, trademarking, copyrighting – you have to strike a balance between competition and the rights of creators, and between diversity and property. The more difficult it becomes to define what you mean by property, the harder it is to strike that balance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just say two things. First of all, I am very disappointed that, on the strength of what seems to have been simply a reaction in principle against what was seen as a concession to David Cameron, we have withdrawn the vote that was scheduled to be held tomorrow on the European patent. Secondly, in its current form I think that the ACTA proposal is, on balance, disproportionate and I intend to oppose it.</p>

This important report takes stock of the implementation status of EU water legislation ahead of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, which the Commission has announced for this autumn.</p>
      <p sl="it">Much has been done in the 12 years since the Water Framework Directive entered into force, but there is still a huge amount left to do, especially in many southern European countries such as Italy, which is to appear before the Court of Justice because of delays in implementing the directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to ensure sufficient availability of good-quality water, bearing in mind that water resources in Europe are distributed unevenly, and consequently we must mainstream this issue in all European policy areas. It is unacceptable that as much as 70% of the water supplied to our communities may be lost through leakage due to the poor state of repair of our water systems.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have voted in favour of Mr Seeber’s report. However, I would like to say that the report does, of course, highlight the fact that some Member States have been slow to transpose the Water Framework Directive, which has already been in force for 12 years. Mr Seeber’s and my own home country of Austria should have changed its charging schemes a long time ago. This is clear, in particular, from paragraph 37 and paragraph 15. I believe that it is an appalling anachronism that in his own native country, of all countries, in the majority of provinces, the charges for water and wastewater are still being calculated on the basis of a property’s floor area. This method of charging has nothing to do with saving water.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I am calling on the Commission and, in particular, on Mr Seeber himself to ensure that Austria finally complies with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and changes its charging scheme to a system that promotes water-saving measures. Overall, I welcome this report. I hope that it applies additional pressure to ensure that this unfair charging system, which also, of course, encourages people to use water wastefully and produce larger quantities of wastewater, is finally changed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is increasingly being seen as a public asset, a precious resource for the whole of humankind. It is vital, therefore, to develop an integrated, efficient strategy for the wise use of this finite resource.</p>
      <p sl="it">Measures at EU level must address our continent’s current and future water challenges, and therefore the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’ to be published in November is more important than ever to ensure – as has been said – sufficient availability of good-quality water for sustainable and equitable use. I regard this as an important aspect of the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Water is linked to food or, rather, water is part of food, and a small amount of food contains a huge amount of water, so a water strategy is also a strategy to ensure food security for Europe and the world. Water can lead to wars, but it can also be a factor for development and peace; I therefore strongly support the proposal contained in the report to devote 1%, for example, of water tariffs to decentralised cooperation measures and growth projects around the world.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the recognition that water is a public good, that access to water constitutes a fundamental and universal right and that there has to be a strong social dimension to water pricing. I also welcome the emphasis on water conservation in this report which, alarmingly, points out that 70% of water supplied to cities across Europe is lost through leakages. Indeed, in my own constituency, Dublin, around 100 million litres – or 30% per day – is lost through leakages. A European-funded replacement programme throughout our older cities could be part of a stimulus package, and would create much needed employment and replace infrastructure that is over a hundred years old.</p>
      <p sl="en">As water is a fundamental right, I believe that it is important that water utilities remain in public ownership, and that income from charges levied must be ring-fenced for the upgrading of the infrastructure. Moreover, in order to ensure that the vulnerable and less well-off are protected, there should be a quota for households for basic use before charges are applied. This would be in keeping with the ‘polluter pays’ principle.</p>

      <p sl="it">I agree with Mr Seeber: we should establish strict European water legislation that supports the green economy based, in part, on the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with transparent and effective pricing schemes, as well as incentives and investment for the use of treated wastewater, grey water and rainwater; we should also implement a quality audit on the state of the European water network to prevent as much as 70% of the water supplied to European cities from being lost as a result of leaks in the water system.</p>

Water security and environmental standards, e.g. the ‘polluter pays’ principle, key goals of the Water Framework Directive, must be preserved and furthered, and this report, unfortunately, casts light on the slow progress of the directive. That many EU water bodies will not have achieved good status by 2015 is, of course, a disappointment and it is distressing to read that even the basic information on European water quality and quantity, which we evaluate our progress from, still remains poor.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome, however, the conclusion that the regional dimension must be addressed more closely and that water policy should be mainstreamed into all policy areas. I am in favour, however, of acting at international global level wherever possible, and the report notes correctly that there needs to be more focus on the international angle.

Therefore, it is essential that mechanisms are in place throughout each individual Member State to safeguard this vital resource. I am pleased to report that in my own constituency of Northern Ireland, water quality standards are improving year on year. In 2011, standards at the tap were 99.8% compliant; with regard to wastewater quality in 2010, our targets were exceeded, with 88.6% of works compliant with current regulations.</p>

Although farmers in Northern Ireland are very much in support of the need for action, in order to maintain their land in good condition ensuring long-term fertility and productivity, the challenges faced in protecting agricultural soils vary across Europe. Therefore, I believe that a harmonised approach is not the best way to safeguard resources.

The water that ends up in our home and in our workplaces is not free. The water that comes from the sky may be free, but it has to be collected, it has to be stored, filtered and pumped to homes, offices and other places. All that costs money. So it is essential that we have the right legislative framework in place to allow companies to do that, to provide us with clean running water, and to make sure that they can actually provide what we as consumers want at the end of the day.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recently – well in fact a couple of years ago – we had a problem in my constituency of London with Thames Water not fixing enough of their broken and leaking pipes. When I challenged them about this and asked why they were not spending more resources on it, one of the reasons they gave – not the only reason, but one of the reasons they gave – was that they were spending too much time adhering to EU directives rather than actually fixing the problems they wanted to fix. An EU regulation like this can sometimes allow companies to take their eye off the ball and we have to ensure that they concentrate on providing clean running water to our constituents.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the health and safety of European citizens is one of the main objectives of our work and action. I believe the report we have adopted this morning is very important. Of course, eCall does not anticipate accidents or reduce them, but it does provide much more rapid response procedures. Once activated, they can ensure an appropriate response to ease victims’ suffering or even save their lives, and all this is very important.</p>
      <p sl="it">Proper, consistent implementation by all stakeholders, the Member States, companies and the system managers will now be decisive, but I think it will be very important to move on from a voluntary, experimental phase, such as we have already had, to this new mandatory regulation. We have introduced a measure that can mitigate many people’s suffering and save the lives of many others.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I come from Ireland and I dread turning on my radio station on a Monday morning because I hear that three young people or two young people have died in single-car accidents, where they hit a tree, a wall or a river, particularly in rural and remote areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Essentially, the situation is that they die in the early hours of the morning probably because of speeding, sometimes because of alcohol. In such a situation, particularly with a single-car accident, time is of the essence. The sooner the police, the medical services and fire services arrive on the scene, the sooner we have a life saved.</p>
      <p sl="en">For many of those people who are found dead on a Saturday morning, a Sunday morning or the early hours of a Monday morning, they would have been saved had the fire services, the police services or the medical services got to them in time.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is what this eCall system is doing. It will coordinate, it will identify the location and it will get all of the emergency rescue services to the scene in time. We need it on a pan-European level. We have a Europe now without borders and this certainly will save lives. I want to, in particular, compliment Dieter Koch who has put a lot of work into this over a ten-year period.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, fully support this resolution urging the Commission to draft legislation requiring car manufacturers to fit the eCall device in all new cars from 2015, and to require Member States to ensure that their emergency services are able to handle the eCall system.</p>
      <p sl="en">The technology has been available for a number of years, but so far less than 1% of cars in the EU are fitted with it, and these are normally at the higher end of the market. It is now clear that mandatory legislation is required.</p>
      <p sl="en">When a serious road accident occurs, every minute is crucial. The driver or passengers may be unconscious or unable to call emergency services due to a language barrier. They may be travelling in a country or in a terrain they are completely unfamiliar with. A car fitted with the device would be able to make an automatic emergency call and transmit data about the location and time of the crash to the nearest emergency response unit.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is estimated that, when the system is rolled out, emergency teams would make it to the scene 40% quicker in urban areas, 50% in rural areas. This could result in saving 2 500 lives across Europe, approximately 25 lives in Ireland. No doubt serious injury would be averted in many instances as well. I welcome the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, back in 2002, road safety experts regarded an EU-wide eCall service available in all vehicles as a priority, because after an accident, the people involved may be in a state of shock, may not know their location or may simply be unable to communicate it.</p>
      <p sl="it">Particularly in accidents, the speed of the emergency response is crucial for saving lives. Based on the 112 call platform, the eCall system cuts emergency response times to the accident scene, thereby saving up to 2 500 lives a year and reducing the severity of injuries by up to 15%. eCall can cut emergency response times by about 50% in rural areas and up to 40% in urban areas, and can also help reduce the congestion caused by road traffic accidents by up to 20%.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The eCall system builds substantially on the EU’s previous decision to establish the common emergency telephone number of 112 of which I remain a supporter. This is alongside the existing national systems, such as the 999 dialling in the UK. The implanting of emergency services’ telecommunications devices within the private motor vehicle has the potential to save thousands of lives by automatically relaying the information about accidents and their whereabouts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although I realise that a voluntary approach to implementing this has largely failed, I am still worried that moving to a mandatory approach may impose significant, although unknown, costs on the Member States. I accept that this should not be a prime concern when human lives are at stake.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was, however, pleased at the committee stage that the ECR Group was successful in guaranteeing a technology-neutral approach whereby private eCall systems can compete with a public eCall, as this is most in accordance with the principles of a single market and also competition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have, of course, also voted in favour of the Koch report. No sensible person would have any fundamental objection to an eCall system which, in the event of a serious accident, automatically notifies the emergency services.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a problem with another emergency number. On the basis of a recommendation by the Council of Europe, a proposal has been drawn up for all the members of the Council of Europe to introduce a standardised Europe-wide emergency number for children who are the victims of abuse and violence. There are still some countries which have not yet implemented this emergency number, including Austria, unfortunately. Therefore, I am calling on all the Members of this House to remind their governments about this emergency number, which will prevent violence and help children who are the victims of violence and abuse, so that we can finally resolve this problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we hear all too often about the tragic loss of life on our roads and quite rightly, in the wake of these tragedies, it is often asked whether anything could have been done to save that life which was lost. I have no doubt that the eCall system has a great deal of merit and has the potential to save many lives, and from this perspective I can, of course, support it.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I do have concerns and would like to see this remain optional rather than mandatory. I believe that Member States should focus their attention very much on the attempts to educate driver behaviour and so try to minimise road deaths in this way as well. It is a terrible scourge in my constituency – we have lost many young lives to deaths on our roads – but we must also look at the impact of speed, the impact of alcohol and drugs and of driver behaviour, as well as at these kinds of measures.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, with regard to the eCall system and the new 112 service for citizens, it should be said that 40 000 people die in road accidents each year and 150 000 people suffer permanent disability. Integrating the eCall system in on-board computers in cars can save up to 2 500 lives annually and reduce the severity of injuries by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As this concerns the saving of human lives, I believe that eCall should be free of charge and the system should be easy to use, accessible to all EU citizens, irrespective of social status, and regardless of whether such services are covered by private services or other state emergency services.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I urge automobile manufacturers to include a system capable of triggering eCall during production so that mobile network operators can transmit the eCalls to emergency call response centres.</p>

Some of the things they say are not suitable for repetition in this Chamber.

      <p sl="en">Once again, though, there seems to be a metaphorical aptness in what we are discussing. The emergency has been caused by precisely such harmonisation as this. If people were to dial their national emergency number – 999 in the case of the UK – they would at least find a responsive national mechanism on the other end that might do something about it. But if they dial a common number expecting the fire brigade, they will instead find the arsonists.</p>

This is because, in January 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal to amend Directive 2009/138/EC ‘in order to take into account the new supervisory architecture for insurance and namely the setting up of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)’, called ‘Omnibus II’. As the trialogue on Omnibus II is still ongoing, the Commission believes the entry into force of Directive 2009/138/EC, without the ‘important adaptations foreseen in Omnibus II’, could place a heavy burden on the Member States. It also considers those rules important for a smooth transition to the new system. In order to become operational, Solvency II requires the inclusion of delegated and implementing acts by the Commission.

This proposal also includes provisions to extend the transposition, repeal and application dates set out in the directive. In order to avoid overly burdensome legislative obligations for Member States under the directive and later on under the new architecture envisaged by the ‘Omnibus II’ proposal, it is appropriate to extend the transposition deadline for the directive. At the same time, given the very short period of time left before the expiry of the deadlines laid down in the directive, this directive should enter into force without delay.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this Solvency II ‘quick fix’ directive in order to extend the deadline for the implementation of the new Solvency II regime which we are still debating in trialogue. This is an extremely important piece of legislation that has been almost 15 years in the making, and we must get it right. The original Solvency I regime comes to an end on 31 October 2012. Therefore, in order to avoid a legislative vacuum, we have decided to extend the Solvency I regime to 1 January 2014. The extension should allow Parliament and the Council sufficient time to reach a compromise that protects policy holders and strengthens our prudential regime, and also keeps our insurance industry globally competitive.</p>

However, in order to take into account the new supervisory architecture for insurance, namely, the setting up of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, it is very important to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime. In order to become fully operational, the Solvency II regime also requires a high number of delegated and implementing acts by the Commission, providing important details on different technical matters.

      <p sl="de">The share crisis of 2001 to 2003 gave a boost to so-called risk-free capital investments, in other words, government bonds. The interest rate on government bonds was used to assess whether or not an insurance company had sufficient funds to meet its liabilities to its customers. In the recession which followed, when the interest on 10-year federal bonds could no longer compensate and the value of liabilities went through the roof, because they were being offset against bonds with a very low interest rate, various attempts were made to rectify the system. The Commission is now concerned that the current crisis, together with the new solvency rules, could prevent the insurance industry from acting as a long-term investor and guarantor. Therefore, it wants the old regulations from Solvency I to continue to apply to existing insurance contracts (after eight years of negotiations on new rules for capital adequacy and the regulation of the industry, which are referred to as Solvency II). As some questions have not yet been fully answered in this area, for example, whether the old rules will turn the insurance companies into investors again, I have abstained from voting.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Directive 2009/138/EC on the taking up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance provides a common regulatory framework for the whole European Union, suitable for modern financial markets, for the management of risk and the supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. It is an important directive from the point of view of the security and stability of the financial system because it strengthens the supervisory framework for the insurance sector. In addition, it introduces mechanisms which mean that the insurance sector will offer better support to a real area of the real economy by encouraging long-term investments. However, in January 2011, it became necessary to revise the directive as a result of changes to the institutional structure of European supervision. In relation to this, provisions concerning postponement of the transposition deadline and the date of first application of the 2009 directive were included in Omnibus II. The complicated nature of the Omnibus II proposal, however, means that the legislative process will not end before the date of first application of Directive 2009/138/EC. I support the proposal to change the transposition date of the Solvency II Directive because it will allow us to avoid excessive legislative responsibilities for Member States and will enable better preparation of the new system provided for in the Omnibus II proposal. The complex nature and the economic importance of the legislation being drafted additionally require that the supervisory bodies and insurance and reinsurance undertakings are allowed a sufficiently long period of time to prepare to operate under the new regulatory regime.</p>

I think that it is totally reasonable that Solvency II, a modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance undertakings, should only be launched from 1 January 2014, in order to guarantee high-quality drafting and implementation of the legislation. The new guidelines are an important step towards establishing a strong and secure insurance sector that can offer sustainable insurance products and support the real economy through long-term investments and added stability.</p>

According to the rapporteur, this change in status will ‘satisfy the needs and special characteristics of the territory of Saint-Barthélemy without prejudicing the interests of the European Union’, keeping the euro as its currency and its citizens remaining European citizens. Saint-Barthélemy has become the 26th country and territory associated with the European Union. I voted for this proposal as it corresponds to the legitimate aspirations of the inhabitants of Saint-Barthélemy, allowing it to strengthen partnerships with its neighbouring states – countries belonging to the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, and outermost regions of the Caribbean – without prejudicing the interests of the European Union.</p>

Consulting Parliament is a necessary step in this process. As the rapporteur says, this change in status satisfies the needs and special characteristics of the territory of Saint-Barthélemy. We respect the wishes and the legitimate and sovereign choices of the peoples of these territories.

However, the European Union should strengthen multi-level governance in all institutional procedures, not only as part of the strategies, but in all areas of political action, in order to facilitate the creation of new macro-regional strategies, as is the case with the possible strategy for the Atlantic, which will bring enormous benefits to the regions. In the specific case of the Mediterranean, as the rapporteur states, the fact that several Member States and regions share the same basin and natural environment, and that their shores are connected by the same history and culture, could bring great benefits to the synergies to be created not only between the Member States and the European Union, but also with neighbouring states.</p>

The proposal to create an Adriatic-Ionian macro-regional cooperation zone does not relate to ‘financing actions’ to meet the grassroots needs of workers in the area; it is designed to deepen the single capitalist market on the islands and strengthen large business groups with hot money from Community funds, by which I mean workers’ money. It reinforces political and economic intervention by the EU in the Western Balkans and North Africa, on the pretext of democracy and human rights. The report, which is faithful to EU policy, does not propose aid with additional resources; it proposes targeted channelling of financing to projects which are highly profitable for capital, involving limited numbers of temporary jobs which are lost on completion of the project. Once again, the winners will be the large monopoly groups and the losers will be the workers, who are being called upon to make sacrifices to support and augment the profits of the plutocracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this resolution to sustain the great opportunity represented by the EU macro-regional strategies. First of all, macro-regional strategies frame the EU’s neighbourhood policies in a way that encourages renewed dialogue and new prospects for territorial cooperation projects supported by cohesion policy. The Baltic Sea strategy is a perfect example of that. When it comes to the Mediterranean, we must consider that the entire basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. In terms of developing potential, maritime traffic must be placed at the heart of a transport strategy for the whole area, particularly for goods. A macro-regional strategy can provide tailored responses to these objectives. The Mediterranean, due to its 500 million inhabitants (less than one third of whom live within the European Union), represents the main ‘neighbourhood prospect’ for Europe. For this reason, I believe that a development dynamic based around the Mediterranean could drive forward the whole European economy.</p>

The EU must urgently offer such prospects for the Mediterranean, an area vital to Europe’s future. The implementation of a macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean basin would enable us to offer common prospects for addressing the challenges facing the Mediterranean countries and to give structure to this key area for Europe’s development and integration. After the failure of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), it is high time we sent a message of hope to the Mediterranean area as a whole, which is currently feeling the effects of the crisis, but which is also being turned upside down as a result of the successive revolutions on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. Given that Parliament has strongly expressed its support for this initiative in the Mediterranean and intends to make it a political priority, it is now up to the Commission to lend its support and it is up to Cyprus to take advantage of its Presidency to make progress in this area and to lay the foundations for this strategy.</p>

Several macro-region projects are at a fairly advanced stage. The macro-regional strategy for the Baltic Sea was adopted in 2009 and, when discussing this strategy, the Commission has stressed ‘the value of this new way of cooperating’. The Union for the Mediterranean is currently being developed and its potential as a catalyst in the region is increasing. The Mediterranean has played a major geopolitical role in European history. However, within the EU, the Mediterranean area is unstructured. Its performance in terms of cooperation and interconnection is very poor. Outside the EU, those populations living in the Mediterranean region have very low standards of living at all levels: economic, social, environmental and political. The development of these societies is essential for them, and an opportunity for Europe to capitalise on greater security, more sustainable control of immigration flows and direct participation in this growth area. This would positively impact on the performance of its own economy. A macro-regional approach would thus enable an overall project to be set out in this area vital to the EU’s future, with a view to emerging from the present crisis and responding to the expectations of all its neighbours, particularly those in the southern Mediterranean.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The pre-development phase is an important stage, when the main strategic areas will be identified and the bases for future governance will be defined.

In addition to the Baltic Sea macro-region, another macro-region whose strategy will help improve the living and working conditions of millions of European citizens is the Danube macro-region.

Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without coordination or vision. The ‘Mediterranean climate’ results in similar ecotypes: the same types of agricultural product are produced and form a single, albeit diverse, range of products. Likewise, environmental problems are the same all over. Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly abundant, but also under serious threat. Appropriate, synergistic responses are called for. Within the EU, the Mediterranean area is unstructured and its performance in terms of cooperation and interconnection is very poor. Moreover, outside the gates of the EU, those populations living in the Mediterranean region have very low standards of living, despite last year’s events. The development of these societies is an essential requirement for them, and an opportunity for Europe as it could capitalise on greater security, more ‘sustainable’ control of immigration flows and direct participation in this growth area.

Whilst highlighting the importance of the Mediterranean as a decentralised area of cooperation, and more broadly in terms of strengthening cross-regional decision making and the sharing of good practices, the report proposes the development of a macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean basin – similar to the strategy for the Baltic, for example – as part of a broader framework which includes the western Mediterranean, the Adriatic-Ionian and the eastern Mediterranean. The report takes the view that an overall policy for the whole Mediterranean basin can be implemented that is in synergy with the priorities set out by regional and international organisations, in particular, those defined by the European Union for the Mediterranean, and best practices that can contribute towards achieving the objectives of EU strategies can also be implemented. I consider emphasis on civil society participation, on the principles/areas of activity to develop and deepen, and on updating the approach to migration in view of the ‘Arab Spring’ excellent additions to the two reports on the ENP for which I was Parliament’s rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Macro-regions, of which the Baltic is the first, are a logical consequence of countries’ increasing interdependence and their similar or common characteristics, with a sense of belonging to a given geographical and cultural space, which transcends borders but still continues to be delimited by borders. A macro-regional approach allows common problems to be addressed and shared, problems tackled, cohesion promoted and solutions sought which are able to benefit all stakeholders. It also gives the European Union an overall view which enables action to be taken in the most appropriate way. I believe that this option, if well managed and adeptly coordinated with the Member States, respecting their sovereignty and promoting and respecting their specific characteristics, could be successfully replicated in various areas.

The experience with implementing the Baltic macro-region demonstrates that this is a good initiative which enhances development for the peoples of these regions. EU economic policy is based on regional cooperation. Therefore, especially in the wake of the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, it is clearly of interest to maintain good relations with the peoples of the southern Mediterranean, and to enhance the development of trade and tourism by utilising existing resources, in particular, maritime traffic and sustainable energies. Moreover, it is an excellent opportunity to promote interregional cohesion and strengthen relations between peoples. I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s report on EU macro-regional strategies for the Mediterranean and I hope that, with the support of the next multiannual financial framework, the EU will continue to collaborate in democratisation processes in the African countries of the Mediterranean basin, so as to achieve greater stability and economic growth in the region.</p>

This vision is, in part, included in the report and in the approach to drawing up macro-regional strategies. However, the EU often subverts the concept of cohesion, in particular, through the ‘renationalisation’ of the costs of EU polices, a lack of funds for cohesion or by imposing conditions, tying countries to strategies, such as the Europe 2020 strategy, whose aims and objectives run counter to the desired cohesion. We appreciate the number of good intentions found in this report, but we cannot fail to express our concern about some of these points.

Macro-regional strategies offer new prospects for territorial cooperation projects supported by cohesion policy.

United by their geographical proximity, Member States, regions and local bodies see macro-regions as the ideal institutional framework in which they can interact to solve their common problems and implement shared policies. Operators in the Mediterranean basin deserve to be given a similar opportunity, given that the area is obviously important for tourism, trade and the economy. Unfortunately, within the EU, the Mediterranean area is not structured effectively enough, with the result that its performance in terms of cooperation and interconnection is very poor. Subdividing the Mediterranean into three large macro-regions (western, Adriatic-Ionian and eastern) would not only make our Mediterranean policies more consistent and operational, but would also encourage greater coordination between the various intervention instruments available to the EU. Establishing a Mediterranean macro-region would therefore be an opportunity for the entire Mediterranean area to adopt coordinated policies aimed at development and growth.

For the macro-region aims to bring together regions (not states) around a common project (a sea, a river, etc.), even if those regions do not belong to a Member State of the EU. The aim is clearly to encourage us to bypass nation states and to promote the blurring of external borders. On the basis that one cannot leave the creation of such entities to spontaneous initiatives, one then asks the Commission to come up with a list of all of the macro-regions that it can imagine and, of course, to encourage their creation. As a result, Mr Alfonsi’s report proposes two macro-regions in the Mediterranean, bringing together areas to the north and south of this sea. This is a precursor to these countries, which are today, for the most part, threatened by Muslim fundamentalism, being included in the European single market and the free movement of people between the two shores.

This unique form of cooperation has already proven its mettle in the Baltic Sea, which will, from now on, serve as a reference framework for other initiatives, such as the strategy launched last year in the Danube or the plans for a strategy at Mediterranean level. This strategy breaks away from traditional cooperation at national or regional level as it brings together all of the institutional actors and partners, such as universities, research centres and regional organisations, from a wider area which are facing the same territorial challenges in terms of the environment, the economy, migration and culture. Defining a strategy in the Mediterranean is entirely justified because of the existence of common characteristics and problems, and European policies could be implemented more effectively at this level.

Apart from the Mediterranean region mentioned in this report, I would also like to give the example of the Black Sea region, which is well-known for its strategic importance deriving from its great wealth of natural resources and a potential market of more than 350 million consumers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, Black Sea cooperation plays a fairly modest role in the European Union’s current plans, but I think that the EU should play a significant role in this region by devising a European strategy for the Black Sea. Any strategy will generate major benefits, not only for the states in the Black Sea basin, but also for the whole EU, thereby establishing a real bridge between Europe and Asia.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Macro-regional strategies provide new platforms for territorial cooperation supported by the EU’s cohesion policy. Although there is no standard definition for macro-regions at the moment, they include territories from several countries or administrative regions which have one or more characteristics in common. Macro-regional strategies were launched three years ago with the strategy for the Baltic Sea macro-region, which set as its objective to target cooperation between the regions in the states around the Baltic Sea in the following areas: environment, prosperity, accessibility and security. This was followed by the strategy for the Danube macro-region, which covers the regions in the Danube basin, with a population of more than 100 million inhabitants and extending over a fifth of the EU’s area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission was initially reluctant to support these initiatives on the grounds that it would put a strain on the administrative structure, increase costs and be ineffective. However, I think that macro-regions provide European added value and can help implement trans-European energy and transport projects. I supported this report because territorial cooperation between macro-regions can bring benefits to the initiatives from the European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs), thereby ensuring the involvement of local and regional authorities, in addition to representatives of civil society, in making decisions aimed at utilising their joint potential efficiently.</p>

The criteria established for the Mediterranean region must be the same as those governing the creation of an Atlantic macro-region. Of the population living in the coastal areas of Europe, 60% live on the Atlantic coast. This region is made up of five Member States and more than 35 sub-state entities, with varying levels of political autonomy. It is also a source of wealth, growth and diversity. We should propose the same thing as is happening with the Mediterranean coast for the Atlantic coast, in its maritime dimension as well as its territorial dimension, which, up until recently, was regrettably not part of the Commission’s communication. Consequently, including this region in the development of major European policies regarding infrastructure, such as the trans-European transport network, and maritime policy will generate significant benefits for European citizens.</p>

On the basis of the experiences acquired here, similar frameworks have been created jointly for different macro-regions in Europe which have common features, such as maritime areas, mountain ranges or river basins, in order to open up new opportunities for territorial cooperation projects as part of cohesion policy. Macro-regional projects may, in principle, have a positive impact on EU Neighbourhood Policy, but a separate macro-regional strategy does not appear to be necessary. There is the risk that the result will simply be to create a large and inefficient system which turns into a bottomless money pit. The argument that an intergovernmental solution should definitely be avoided when organising the macro-regions is hard to understand.

Reality clearly shows that there are areas and peoples that have all kinds of affinities with one another, even though they belong to different countries. The Baltic experience is typical of what can be a useful process of European integration from the bottom up, in other words, a process initiated in order to share common interests and feelings and not one imposed from above, which, unfortunately, has happened all too often in Europe’s recent history. To refer to the Italian dimension, we have southern Italy, for example, which can and should be included in a Mediterranean macro-regional dimension, and northern Italy, which naturally looks towards the Alps as its frame of reference for development. In that regard, the Presidents of the Alpine regions of Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany and Austria met on 29 June in St Gallen, where they laid the foundations for what could become the future macro-region of the Alps. The peoples of Europe, who are all too often sidelined in the European decision-making process, should play a leading role in this macro-region.</p>

We must oppose new bureaucratic structures, not least because they involve additional costs and administration.

I am in favour of this text as it shows Europe’s interest in looking towards the South, the region in which I myself was elected. However, I should like to point out that developing a macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean will be much more difficult than for the rest of the European regions, as the Mediterranean region is a very distinctive area. It is a meeting point, but it is also a border. It is a border for people who share a history, culture, sometimes even the same origins, but whose average income per inhabitant is five times higher in the north than in the south. That is the most marked discrepancy across borders anywhere in the world. It is a border for countries that do not share the same characteristics. Some countries in the south are experiencing a return to democracy with the Arab Spring while others are confined to autocracy. So yes, we must develop a macro-regional strategy. However, we must do it in stages, starting with our closest partners, using culture, tourism, biodiversity, entrepreneurship and so on, and by aligning various existing instruments, such as the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>

In my opinion, this approach makes perfect sense, since the Mediterranean is a coherent whole, constituting a single cultural and environmental area, and sharing several common characteristics and priorities: the same crops, abundant renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy, the importance of tourism, the same natural disaster risks, including fires, floods, earthquakes and water shortages, and risks from human activity, in particular, maritime pollution. A development dynamic based around the Mediterranean could drive forward the whole European economy, a powerful incentive to develop new and active neighbourhood policies, as the so-called ‘Arab Spring’ has highlighted the strategic potential of the geographic, political and economic links between the two sides of the Mediterranean.</p>

Establishing a macro-regional strategy in the Mediterranean could help the participating states to improve the way in which they address problems caused by the characteristics of certain areas, such as drought, maritime pollution and the development of tourism. As far as the islands are concerned, the Commission should apply a strategic plan to address the structural weaknesses of island territories and make island territories as competitive as mainland territories, so as to reduce the gap between different levels of development among European regions and ensure their effective integration in the single market.

The major areas of intervention should include energy grids, scientific cooperation and innovation, cultural networks, education and training, tourism, trade, environmental protection, sustainable maritime transport, maritime security and safety and the protection of the marine environment against pollution, overfishing and illegal fishing, strengthening of good governance and effective public administration for encouraging job creation.

However, he also recognised that macro-regional strategies are a complex structure in terms of governance and harder to coordinate and facilitate cooperation with. I agree and therefore I supported this report with my vote. I support the implementation of a macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean basin, in order to structure this essential space for the future of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I think that the EU Member States and regions in the Mediterranean area must commit to a reinforced cooperation approach, and that this must be opened up to all partners in this area which is essential to the future of Europe. Macro-regional strategy is the best way of achieving this goal. The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the resolution on the single European railway area. This proposal for a directive establishing a single European railway area is a merger of three directives in force and contains provisions regarding the adequate financing of and charging for rail infrastructures, the conditions of competition on the railway market, and the organisational reforms needed to ensure appropriate supervision of the market. I support an adequate, transparent and sustainable funding of the infrastructure, better predictability of the infrastructure development and access conditions, as well as the improvement of the competitiveness of rail operators vis-à-vis other transport modes. It is important that a strong and independent national regulatory body would be established which would exchange information within a network with other national regulatory bodies. Finally, for the successful liberalisation of the railway market, it is necessary to introduce transparent rules for the calculation of track access charges and promote technical harmonisation.</p>

Ten years later, the rail transport sector still has not managed to catch up with other forms of transport. This failure stems primarily from differences between national regulations and the fact that the Member States failed to implement the first railway package. I therefore voted in favour of the recast version of the European railway package, which aims to create a single European railway area. As the fruit of two 10-year periods of bitter negotiations, I particularly supported non-discriminatory access to the railway network, fair competition between railway undertakings, the merging of technical standards, and additional harmonisation in the area of national and cross-border rail transport.</p>

In order to boost investment in the rail sector, there need to be long-term strategies and multiannual contractual agreements between the state and infrastructure managers so that it is easier for market players to predict how infrastructure will be developed. To attract investments in greener technologies, new charging rules need to be applied and charges need to be differentiated according to the noise emission characteristics of the train for European Train Control System-equipped trains. I agree that we should extend the competence of national regulators, strengthen their powers in areas such as sanctions, audits and investigations carried out on the institution’s initiative, and ensure their independence from other public authorities. It is also important to enhance competition in the rail market through more transparent market access conditions and by providing easier access.

It advocates the need for independent regulators to establish a level playing field between large and small railway companies. It proposes that, in the long run, a European regulatory body should be established to oversee cross-border transport. It rejects the Council’s proposals to reduce the duration of the multiannual contractual agreement to three years, and suggests that a duration of seven years should be proposed instead.

My main reason for not supporting this package is the commitment it makes to continuing down the path of liberalisation, particularly the repeated, sustained commitment to opening up passenger transport to competition. In this package, the Commission and Parliament have also committed themselves to continuing with plans to separate infrastructure managers and transport services, while in our respective countries, particularly in France, we have seen that this separation causes many problems, and that we ought to go back to the drawing board in order, perhaps, to envisage something other than ever increasing liberalisation.</p>

Establishing a single railway area requires, in particular, strong and independent national regulators to establish a level playing field between big and small railway companies but also a European regulatory body to ensure a more integrated regulatory oversight of international services.

Independent regulators are, in my view, crucial for furthering the construction of a single European railway area and establishing a level playing field for both large and small railway companies. Ultimately, national regulatory bodies should become entities whose decisions are reliable and timely. I agree with the rapporteur that in the longer run, a European regulatory body should be established to oversee cross-border transport effectively.

In the long term, I think that a European regulatory body should be created to supervise cross-border transport. To lay the foundations for such a body, a network of national regulatory bodies needs to be set up which must become trusted entities that can take quick, effective decisions.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the Serracchiani report on a single European railway area. At a time when the Union’s railway area is being divided up, it is vital to legislate by moving towards greater convergence of national regulations. Adopted in 2001, the first railway package aimed to improve the attractiveness of rail transport, but, 10 years later, we find it has not been implemented. In order to compensate for the inadequate development and maintenance of infrastructures, this report proposes to make rail transport – the main mode of transport – an economic vehicle for developing the European territory. Indeed, these structural reforms aim to boost private and public investment so that new operators can enter a more ‘open’ railway market. It is also necessary to safeguard the rules of a fair and non-discriminatory railway market. In addition, fair competition should be guaranteed between rail companies, as should access to reliable, safe and efficient services. I believe that railway transport can be a showcase for European technology around the world.</p>

The privatisation of railways in the UK caused many problems and users still suffer from higher prices while operators suffer from delays due to issues regarding track maintenance. This legislation, in effect, would put control of UK rail networks into the hands of Brussels, making services even less accountable to users, despite Brussels arguing the opposite.

The need to change carriages at specific borders when travelling between the Member States puts people off and is one reason why this type of transport is underused. It is therefore urgent to standardise the railway gauges of European rail networks.

      <p sl="sk">After enjoying great prosperity during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the railway sector fell into decline due to the increasing popularity of road and air travel and is now becoming less and less popular. In order to curb this decline, the European Union has adopted a number of legislative measures aimed at reviving the railways by gradually creating a single European railway area. In recent years, it has introduced several packages and guidelines by which it has signalled its desire to reform the regulatory framework to ensure the railway sector’s integration at European level and to enable it to face up to the competition from other transport modes on the best possible terms. The transport policy of the European Union has set itself the goal of building an internal market, in particular, by developing common policies in order to achieve competitiveness in the transport sector as well. I firmly believe that it is desirable to make the necessary effort to build a comprehensive and integrated European railway area. In my opinion, the common interests of the EU as a whole – if we are talking about the railway sector – should take precedence over the interests of individual Member States. We need to build a true European railway area in which we should not forget to comply with safety requirements, and this should play a greater role in the licensing of railway undertakings.</p>

      <p sl="it">Developing the European railway sector to the full is an essential step towards completing the single market across the continent. Maximum freedom of movement and the ability to ship goods without barriers can make the difference between an operational, expanding economic system and a chaotic one that just limps along. At the same time, this process of development needs to be guided by the same principles that regulate the single market, in other words, free competition and transparency. The measures adopted are on the right track in this respect because they aim to stimulate the provision of freight and passenger transport services and ensure fair competition. Establishing strong, independent national regulators coordinated by the European Commission so as to encourage mutual collaboration is the best way to ensure the rules are properly applied, while the requirement for railway companies and infrastructure managers to draw up separate, transparent accounts should prevent any illegal transfers of public funds between these two kinds of body. At the same time, the separation of managers’ and companies’ accounts should stimulate competition, providing the necessary balance between transparency and flexibility to ensure adequate investment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">After many months of negotiations, we have at last adopted the recast of the European railway legislation. Although it does not regulate everything, it nevertheless allows rail transport to be strengthened in the EU, particularly by clarifying the roles of the various actors in the rail transport sector. The flagship measures include strengthening the independence of the national regulators and establishing a European network of regulators in order for there to be a uniform interpretation and application of the legislation. Another vital aspect of this recast is the clarification of financial flows between the infrastructure manager and railway undertaking. This vote does not signal the end of the reform of the European railway market. Indeed, next year, the Commission should present new legislative proposals, particularly on the thorny issue of the liberalisation of national passenger transport and on the separation between the infrastructure management and transport operations.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Officially, it is stated that the amendments to the directive proposed by the European Commission came about in order to develop the rail sector system and establish a single transport market. However, there is concern that some of the proposed provisions may have very negative consequences or be damaging to the Lithuanian rail system. In Lithuania, as in the other Baltic States, the situation in the rail sector is specific due to rail track that does not conform to European standards, and which is largely still integrated into the market of the CIS countries. In this project being discussed, compromises that would be more favourable to Lithuania are put forward. The requirement to separate rail infrastructure from the carriage of passengers and freight, which caused most dissatisfaction, has gone. However, other requirements on guaranteeing the independence of freight terminals, stations, refuelling, route allocation, etc., remain and these cause Lithuanian rail workers just as much concern. Consequently, there may be major problems in future because guaranteeing the independence of these divisions within one undertaking will be practically impossible and then the EU may begin to demand their separation. There are also many doubts about the proposal to make it possible to impose a higher infrastructure levy for the transportation of freight from third countries. It is not clear how this provision would be implemented in practice, especially as there is no doubt that the Commission will demand that levies be reduced and the difference covered by the state budget. The European Parliament will debate the Rail Directive again in the autumn. I hope that it will be possible to find convincing arguments, which lead to wording in the directive that is favourable to Lithuania and guarantees the continued functioning of its rail system.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The establishment of a single European railway area has the aim of improving rail services by increasing competition, strengthening the powers of national regulators and enhancing the framework for investments in this sector. In this perspective, it is vital to guarantee, on the one hand, non-discriminatory access to train paths and service facilities and, on the other, transparency of prices set by independent national regulators. It is also necessary to separate and control accounts so as to ensure that railway undertakings, structurally linked to infrastructure managers, do not have an advantage over their competitors.

Having a gauge other than the EU standard one, it constitutes a special case for which the general provisions of the directive do not fit. Since 6% of the entire Polish railway transport performance in 2011 (54 billion tonne-kilometres) were transported on the LHS, the lack of support from the Members of the European Parliament shown today will seriously harm its performance and thus weaken the second largest rail freight market in Europe.</p>

The aim is to make the railway area more open to competition and thus offer better services to passengers and freight users. It is necessary to specify the methods of financing this infrastructure, the conditions of competition and the rules for monitoring the market.

      <p sl="pt">I voted for Ms Serracchiani’s report on recasting EU rail transport legislation because it consolidates two key objectives: (i) to make progress in creating a cross-border European railway market, without which a true internal market cannot exist; (ii) to strengthen conditions for rail transport efficiency and enable competition with road and air transport, which do not internalise their extra environmental costs. I also believe that a single European-level railway market cannot be effectively regulated in a fragmented way between national regulators. The creation of a pan-European regulator is therefore required. Hence, the solution put forward of a Board of National Regulators, chaired by the Commission, must be seen as an intermediate solution, as a step towards the creation of a future EU railway regulator, without harming national regulators as decentralised bodies at national level.</p>

In order to ensure the development of competition, continued investment and the cost effectiveness of service provision, I believe that different divisions or entities within the same undertaking should manage infrastructure and transport services. It should be noted that the exception provided for in the directive regarding the possibility of imposing a higher levy for the carriage of cargo from third countries is doubtful and difficult to implement in practice.

There should be a detailed discussion on whether rail infrastructure managers should be separated from operators. This would also give rail companies from third countries a presence in the EU rail market, whose interests may not necessarily coincide with the goals of EU transport policy. In some EU Member States, it would pose a certain threat to security. Furthermore, when considering the issue of a single European railway area, we should effectively continue to strive to reduce the specific characteristics of the rail systems of certain EU Member States.

For this reason, I have wholeheartedly supported Ms Serracchiani’s recommendation. There are two aspects within it which I would like to emphasise. The first relates to the creation of a network of fully independent national regulators with greater powers, coordinated by the Commission, with the possibility, in the future, of establishing a single European regulator. The second concerns the change of duration of the contract between Member State and infrastructure manager from three to five years. This change will make it possible to have better medium- and long-term guarantees for investment plans. A single railway area will permit non-discriminatory access to the market and will make our railway network stronger, healthier and more competitive.</p>

      <p sl="et">In today’s vote, I supported the adoption of the newly formulated first railway package as agreed upon in the trilateral meetings between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. I am glad to see that concrete steps are finally being taken to implement the legislation that was adopted more than ten years ago. Unfortunately, many of the Member States have still not transposed all of the directives of the first railway package into national law, even though that should have been done by 15 March 2003. The Commission postponed initiating infringement proceedings against Member States for improper or incomplete implementation of the first railway package until June 2008. Infringement proceedings were initiated against 22 Member States, which shows that the creation of a single European railway area is still a long way off. A free and accessible transportation market is one of the pillars of the single European common market. The free movement of goods and persons must be guaranteed, and it is especially important to safeguard this using a more environmentally friendly mode of transport. An increase in the use of railways can only be ensured through the establishment and development of a single infrastructure and a single system of rules. I am therefore glad to see that the adoption of this report was supported by the majority of Members, myself included.</p>

Since January 2012, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been holding informal negotiations designed to reach an agreement at second reading. The excessively long periods requested by the Council for the entry into force of this new directive, which are generally 36 months, and 60 months for the establishment of the regulatory body, are too long for the implementation of such an urgent plan.

      <p sl="fr">This new directive, the result of two years of difficult negotiations with the Member States, aims to create a ‘global and integrated’ European railway area, both for freight and international passenger transportation. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the share of rail in freight transport and bring down prices for passengers. The new rules provide that transport operators and infrastructure managers must necessarily have separate accounts to ensure transparency of any transfers of public funds between the two entities, even if they are in a holding company, and so avoid disadvantaging potential private operators. All operators, whether public or private, should enjoy the same tariffs and conditions of access to a given network, both in terms of train paths and service facilities (maintenance workshops, stations). Finally, allocation of train paths to operators will include incentives to modernise bonus-malus type equipment with a view to reducing noise and equipping trains with the European Train Control System (ETCS) for maximum safety. The text does not deal with Member States’ internal relations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The creation of a single railway area depends on consistent, transparent and simplified legislation which encourages a competitive business environment. Following the trialogue negotiations, the Council proposal significantly reduced the ambitions of the proposal tabled by the Commission and by Parliament. As such the rapporteur’s recommendation aims to strengthen the objectives already debated and adopted by Parliament, in order to reach an agreement at second reading. The points that the rapporteur aims to strengthen are access to rail-related services, infrastructure financing, rates of infrastructure use, strengthening the powers of the regulatory body, total network management independence and financial transparency. Nonetheless, Parliament is aiming for a European regulatory body to be established in the long run, to be able to oversee cross-border transport. To this end, it is calling for a network of national regulatory bodies to be formed. I am voting for this recommendation, as I consider the simplification of the existing legislation to be essential in order to achieve the objectives included in the Transport White Paper Horizon 2050.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the proposal for a directive establishing a single European railway area. In view of the international aspect of European railway transport, it is important to set out at EU level general principles for issuing licences to railway companies and coordinating Member States’ systems which regulate the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the charges for using it. The new directive obliges Member States to adopt and publish an indicative strategy, which covers a minimum period of five years and is renewable, for developing the railway infrastructure in order to meet future mobility needs, and for maintaining, renewing and developing the infrastructure based on sustainable financing of the railway system. Transparent rules on access to rail-related services and service infrastructures (freight terminals, maintenance facilities, train formation facilities and so on) are crucial to the sector’s competitiveness. To ensure the railway system’s development and efficient operation, the provision of transport services and operation of the infrastructure will be managed separately and must have separate accounts. Member States can also stipulate that this separation will require the organisation of distinct divisions within the same company or that the infrastructure and transport services will be managed by separate entities.</p>

      <p sl="el">The report on the recast directive on a single European railway area promotes faster privatisation of public rail transport in all the EU Member States, so that they can be handed over to large business groups trading in that sector. The so-called ‘third EU package’ on rail transport completed the break-up of rail transport by dividing the infrastructure network from primary rail transport operations. This facilitated privatisation, as the profitable part of transport operations has been sold off, while the infrastructure network and concomitant costs have remained in the public sector. The aim of the recast ‘third package’ is to remove all (administrative and technical) obstacles to privatisation, so as to complete the interconnection of rail networks in all the Member States and promote the takeover of state railways by monopoly groups, especially in the strong capitalist EU Member States. This will provoke a wave of redundancies and exacerbate working conditions, send passenger fares and freight tariffs through the roof and reduce the standard of transport services and safety of the railways. This policy has already been consistently applied by the New Democracy and PASOK capitalist governments in Greece and by the previous and present coalition.</p>

In working to ensure free competition in the market for railway services, we must remember that in some Member States, there are self-financing railway lines in operation which are not connected to national and European networks, are of regional importance and have a gauge which is different from the dominant network within the Member State concerned. The need to apply all the provisions of the directive to these self-contained railways will impose a disproportionate and irrational burden and will interfere with and distort the objective for which they were built. In speaking, on the one hand, about deregulation and facilitating a Europe of growth, we must not, at the same time, hinder the operation of successful enterprises by badly thought-out implementation of legislation, because these firms represent the real and often the only added value in poor regions of the EU.</p>

I think it is a mistake not to take account of the specific features of countries such as Poland, where universal access to competition in the railway market could, as a result, bring about the collapse of the national railway operator, Polskie Koleje Państwowe. We need more time and more money to adapt to modern methods in railway transport. We can and should promote competition, but this should be done when all enterprises operating in the market have similar opportunities to compete.

      <p sl="pl">The Broad Gauge Metallurgical Railway Line, which is owned by the Polish national railway operator Polskie Koleje Państwowe, is part of the rail transport industry and is responsible for almost 400 km of broad-gauge railway line. Between 2001 and 2010, the company invested PLN 386.3 million in its operations. In the same period, the company also spent PLN 421.8 million on repairs and renovation. This money came from the company’s own funds and has enabled the company to adapt successfully to changing market conditions. The line itself is directly connected with countries from outside the EU and with their broad-gauge transport system, and should be excluded from the rules concerning the single railway area. I support the retention of Amendment 12 to Article 2, which was adopted in November last year, and, in connection with this, I also hope the company will be able to continue operating on its current basis. The amendment was adopted by a ratio of 2 votes to 1 in Parliament, and in Committee was also adopted by the same proportion.

The revision aims to combat fraud, enforce better working conditions for professional drivers and save European transport companies up to EUR 515 million per year by reducing administrative burdens. The European Commission has found that up to 45 000 vehicles were in breach of EU tachograph rules at least once. Breaches include not adhering to minimum rest periods or maximum driving times, resulting in fatigued drivers and increased road safety risks. With this latest proposal, Parliament is seeking to support the transport industry by easing the burden on companies and clarifying tachograph laws. However, road safety is of paramount importance, and transport companies operating in Europe and their drivers must obey the safety rules.</p>

It is particularly important for the EU Member States to comply with the Tachograph Regulation and apply social rules to transport companies because companies which do not comply with the legislation will gain a sizeable competitive advantage by cutting prices, as staff costs account for up to 50% of a transport company’s total operating costs.</p>

A revision of existing legislation is also needed. The aim of the new regulation is to make fraud more difficult and to better enforce social rules, chiefly through ‘smart tachographs’ that make full use of new technologies. These innovative and more efficient devices will allow the control authorities to directly target vehicles that commit infringements and better monitor the driving and rest times of drivers.

Firstly, I would argue that the nature of the tachograph departs from/does not relate to/does not fall within the definition of what a ‘work period’ is: on this point, I note that my proposal to use the term ‘control’ instead of ‘work’ was not taken into consideration/evaluated by my fellow Members. This may have a negative effect on the autonomy of every firm in relation to managing the working hours of its employees. Secondly, the practice of retrofitting will give rise to huge expenditure for firms, of dubious value (even the Commission has said as much). Retrofitting is the requirement in the rapporteur’s proposal for all vehicles to install, by 2020, the new ‘smart tachograph’ in the name of greater safety, without any preliminary study which confirms the usefulness of this.

Two main problems have been identified – social rules are still breached too often and the tachograph system is not sufficiently efficient. According to data provided by the Commission, on average, 9% of controlled vehicles are found to be breaching the social rules. Roughly a quarter of them are found to be breaching the Tachograph Regulation in particular. Furthermore, the tachograph system has been designed and has functioned thus far primarily as a policing tool, but not as a labour saving device. Therefore, in order to better enforce social rules and reduce the administrative burden by making full use of new technologies and introducing a number of new regulatory measures, existing social legislation needs to be reviewed.

      <p sl="en">A number of amendments have raised serious concerns inside the British freight industry. Amendment 136 seeks to broaden the reach of the legislation by altering the weight threshold for vehicles subject to regulation, in some cases bringing it down to 1.5 tonnes. This brings millions of vans into the remit without any recourse to an impact assessment. It would bankrupt small businesses up and down the UK reliant upon such vehicles that do not have the resources to accommodate such regulation. Similarly, Amendment 134 alters the weight limit down to 2.8 tonnes. Whilst companies in Germany operate under such limits, the UK does not. It broadens the scope of the legislation enormously – again without adequate justification. Many representatives of the UK freight and haulage industry strongly opposed plans to prevent operators carrying out their own tachograph calibration. It is right that this amendment be lifted and I hope that it stays out of future proposals. Today’s proposals establish far reaching surveillance that goes beyond anything anticipated or justified. I fear that permitting these amendments could pave the way for Brussels to roll out similar levels of monitoring and enforcement for other road users and in other industries.</p>

The new digital tachograph will have a direct impact on the current state of measurements of data relating to driving, speed and drivers’ rest periods, having an effect on the method of control and associated compliance with the regulations in force. I particularly support the deadlines laid down for the mandatory entry into force of the digital tachograph, setting an adaptation period ending in 2020. This will be the deadline by which all Member States will have to adapt, by adopting this new measurement instrument. On the other hand, I do not feel able to support the option for derogations from these rules, since that would permit a fragmentation of the market which would create competitive disadvantages for producers and, above all, for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since 1969, the European Union has laid down social legislation in the field of road transport to improve road safety and drivers’ working conditions, and to ensure fair competition among transport companies. The EU developed a comprehensive policy on inspecting and checking compliance, relying on two main pillars: Directive 2006/22/EC, which lays down a minimum level of checks at the roadside and at the premises of the undertakings, to be carried out by the Member States; and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Tachograph Regulation’. Two main problems which need to be tackled at EU level have been identified by the Commission. The first problem is that social rules are still too often breached: on average, 9% of controlled vehicles are found breaching the social rules. The second problem is that the tachograph system is not sufficiently efficient: there is room to make tachographs easier to operate, especially digital tachographs and their additional functionalities, so as to facilitate drivers’ work and make the transport system more efficient. I voted for the amendments to the regulation because I believe that they will contribute to solving the problems that have been identified.</p>

The purpose of the regulation on recording equipment in road transport is to monitor the drivers’ driving/rest times using tachographs, and it should be reserved for that purpose. If we use tachographs to monitor compliance with the maximum transport times for live animals, we will, in my opinion, be using the recording equipment for a different purpose from that set out in the regulation.

Thanks to Parliament’s hard work, significant amendments have been made to meet the demands voiced on many occasions by trade unions, workers and many small enterprises: the introduction of tachographs for all heavy goods vehicles weighing in excess of 2.8 tonnes and the introduction of weight sensors are two clear examples of the good work done during recent months within the committee and then in the Chamber. Too often, the needs of the market and strong competition between operators adversely affect working and health conditions for lorry drivers, and also seriously jeopardise the safety of the millions of European citizens on the EU’s roads and motorways. The balance that has been achieved in this regulation between the needs for security and control and the flexibility to be given to self-employed workers and small enterprises is an excellent outcome, and has therefore been broadly supported by the majority of MEPs.</p>

This new version of the tachograph will apply to heavy goods vehicles of 2.8 tonnes or more (and no longer 3.5 tonnes or more), and to vehicles transporting nine persons or more. We have also paved the way for electronic use of the device, replacing manual use, which heralds the introduction of the ‘smart tachograph’ by 2020, which should enable road transport undertakings to save the equivalent of EUR 515 million in administrative costs per year, as well as prevent fraud.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Traffic accidents account for the greatest number of transport-related deaths in the EU. We hear about tragic accidents involving coaches ever more often. The heaviest vehicles, in other words. lorries and coaches, present the greatest danger, of course. Significant attention therefore needs to be paid to the working conditions of professional drivers and to their compliance with regulations. The European policy of checks and inspections in road transport is based on Directive 2006/22/EC on the minimum level of checks at the roadside and at the premises of transport businesses, and on Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport. At present, analogue tachographs are in use in vehicles registered before 1 May 2006, and digital tachographs in vehicles registered after that date. The problem is that the conditions laid down by these regulations are breached. Honest transport operators who stick to the rules are thereby ‘penalised’. Businesses that do not stick to the rules gain an unacceptable competitive advantage on the market, and can offer transport at lower prices. The second problem is inefficient tachographs. The tachographs in use do not evaluate whether there has been a breach of the rules on the number of hours of driving and rest for drivers, but only record data on driving. In view of the possibilities of digital networks and satellites, I would like to call for the future linking up of digital tachographs with checkpoints.

My main concerns relate to the lengths this regulation goes to regarding enforcement, remote communication and retrofitting. Strengthening enforcement requirements should not undermine those Member States which already have stringent methods in place. The same also goes for the mandatory use of remote equipment, which is already used in the UK; it should be up to individual Member States to decide if this is a beneficial tool as their effectiveness is dependent upon the existing enforcement regime.

This irresponsible behaviour represents a real threat to safety on our roads and calls for suitable penalties.

From the point of view of privacy, we would question the benefit of being able to pinpoint the location of drivers all over Europe. The proposal also contains provisions to the effect that undertakings in Europe should use the same type of technology. There are currently many undertakings that have come up with a good design of their own for recording equipment, and we are concerned about the EU chaining itself to any one particular type of technology, with the result that the product development carried out by the undertakings will have been costly work that was carried out needlessly.

From now on, recording equipment, or tachographs, will be more efficient and reliable and will incorporate the latest technological innovations. This will enable more stringent checks to be carried out on drivers’ driving and rest times. In addition to improving road safety, this text will enable us to combat unfair competition within the road transport industry.</p>

      <p sl="de">Given the growing volume of traffic on Europe’s roads, it is essential for us to take measures to increase road safety. Greater control is needed over transit traffic in particular, in order to reduce the risk of accidents. The risk is particularly high in this case because the drivers are often put under time pressure by the haulage companies and, therefore, overtiredness is a frequent problem. Recording devices are available in the form of mandatory analogue and digital tachographs, but it is still possible to manipulate these devices. Excessively long journeys with breaks that are too few in number and too short significantly increase the risk of accidents occurring. I have abstained because, while I agree with the rapporteur on the one hand that the introduction of intelligent tachographs can have a positive impact on the working life of truck drivers, on the other hand, I do not share her opinion that EU-wide regulations concerning the monitoring of tachographs are needed, as the Commission is proposing. The regulatory bodies in the individual countries should continue to investigate and assess the situation on their own roads.</p>

Parliament, however, hopes that lorries used within a radius of 100 km by persons who do not drive the lorries as their main activity will be exempt from the use of a tachograph, since otherwise, categories such as craftspeople would experience serious difficulty.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In order to guarantee optimum road safety for all road users and acceptable working conditions for drivers, we have introduced strict standards for working and rest times and made digital tachographs (instruments that record data on drivers’ behaviour) compulsory for new vehicles weighing over 2.8 tonnes.

That is the gist of the Commission’s proposal, which, on the whole, I support. However, in order to ensure maximum safety, in my view, it is crucial to record the vehicle’s speed and weight as well as the driver’s working and rest times, as these are often contributing factors in accidents. Furthermore, to avoid imposing unnecessary administrative burdens on self-employed craftsmen, I am in favour of an exemption for vehicles used within a 100 km radius by drivers whose main occupation is not driving.

Tachographs have a concrete impact on the daily lives of drivers, and because of that it is vitally important to make them more efficient in order to improve road safety, drivers’ working conditions and to ensure fair competition among transport companies. Improving safety on Europe’s roads is a duty which the European Union cannot ignore. The establishment of statutory obligations for manufacturers of tachographs, authorities, transport operators and drivers, as contained in the report, does precisely this.

      <p sl="et">With its regulation, the European Union has set maximum driving periods for a 24-hour period and for a week and minimum periods of rest for a 24-hour period and for a week.

In addition, directives to regulate the inspection to be performed by Member States and the use of analogue and digital tachographs are also in force. The amendments to this regulation arise from the fact that the provisions of social law are frequently contravened, while the system of tachographs is not as effective as it should be. I essentially support the Commission’s proposals for improving this regulation, as well as the majority of the rapporteur’s amendments, and I also approve of the fact that this regulation does not apply to vehicles whose principal activity is not transport services and whose area of activity does not exceed 100 km from its company’s place of business. For that reason, I did not vote against this regulation. Unfortunately, I was unable to support the regulation and abstained, since the scope of the regulation was extended from the previous 3.5-tonne laden weight to 2.8-tonne laden weight, which is not justified under current market conditions. I also believe that Member States could permit the radius of vehicles’ area of activity to be extended to 150 km instead of the 100 km offered by the Commission, but unfortunately, this did not find favour at the plenary session of Parliament.</p>

Technologies are rapidly advancing in all fields, and the introduction of a new type of smart digital tachograph, known as ‘smart’, should be welcomed – it will facilitate remote communication between the tachograph and control equipment for the purposes of control, allow for automatic recording of the exact location with the help of GNSS, and thereby make control simpler and easier. However, in my opinion, the requirement to install tachographs from now on in smaller goods vehicles weighing up to 2.8 tonnes, instead of the current 3.5 tonnes, is ill-considered. These are vans. It is doubtful whether the benefits with regard to traffic safety and control will justify the additional expenses that this will cause to small and medium-sized enterprises. Secondly, the amendment included in the report which states that the individual employment contracts of drivers of vehicles engaged in international transport are to be regulated by the legislation of the country in which or from which the driver makes the most journeys runs directly counter to international regulations (the so-called Rome Convention) and EU regulations on the law applicable to contractual obligations. Essentially, this sets a dangerous precedent for interfering with the fundamental principles and legal framework of the market in order to address social regulations.

Intellectual property rights (IPR) are fundamental to innovation, which is a key priority of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Given the increase of IPR infringements and international trade in infringing goods, large parts of economic growth and jobs in the EU depend on the effective enforcement of IPR. It is estimated that piracy and counterfeiting cost European businesses EUR 250 billion each year. The customs authorities are in a comparatively good position to enforce IPRs effectively at the EU’s external borders, before the goods enter the internal market. Once the goods spread across different Member States, it becomes much more difficult and costly to trace them and to initiate proceedings.

      <p sl="fr">The European Union legislates in many fields. It is therefore our role as MEPs to ensure that legislative measures are in accordance with developments in society. For example, the 2003 legislation concerning customs enforcement of intellectual property rights is now obsolete due to strong growth in e-commerce. One of the key measures of the revised regulation is to introduce a simplified procedure for small consignments. Online sales did indeed cause a spectacular increase of detentions in postal traffic by 200%. In response to this, the Commission plans to enable ‘small consignments’ suspected of being counterfeit goods to be destroyed without the agreement of the rights holder, thus reducing costs and the administrative burden for customs. For greater legal certainty and to avoid any confusion, we have submitted an amendment aimed at extending the scope of these measures to include patents. The text was therefore adopted despite the changing opinions of the socialists who allowed themselves to be influenced by lobbies at the last minute.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. Intellectual property is a factor of European competitiveness and it is therefore particularly important to protect it. Intellectual property right (IPR) infringements and the global trade in counterfeit goods have a negative impact on EU industry as well as consumers’ health and safety. At EU borders, customs authorities are both in the frontline of the fight against counterfeiting and the illegal entry of goods into the EU and I therefore welcome the proposal to revise the existing border enforcement regulation, with the aim of protecting IPR while streamlining customs procedures. I agree that procedures should be laid down enabling the customs authorities to prevent the movement of goods which infringe IPR. The principle that fake goods also constitute infringements of IPR when they are for private use should also be recognised. I believe that the simplified investigation procedure should be applicable not only to counterfeit and pirated goods, but to all IPR infringements. I agree that rights holders should obtain access to information about the goods destroyed and that they should be entitled to seek compensation from the consignees.</p>

I think that customs authorities should be able to inspect goods which are or should have been subject to customs supervision in the customs territory of the EU, including goods placed under a suspensive procedure, aimed at enforcing intellectual property rights.

      <p sl="pl">Intellectual property rights have recently become a hot topic as a priority of the Europe 2020 strategy. On 24 May 2011, the Commission adopted a communication entitled ‘A single market for intellectual property rights’. It embarked on a number of initiatives, as part of which the new regulation on customs enforcement of intellectual property rights is to take the place of the existing regulation – 1383/2003/EC – before the end of the year. It is an important subject, and in the light of the problems over ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, it has become very popular with the public.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The fight against fake goods is becoming increasingly difficult. It is estimated that piracy and counterfeiting cost European businesses EUR 250 billion each year. From 2009 to 2010, cases of fake goods registered by customs at the EU’s borders doubled from 43 572 to 79 112. A particular rise in illegal postal traffic, as high as 200%, was recorded in relation to online sales, and over 69% of this traffic contained counterfeit medicines, which are so dangerous to consumers’ health. The problem is a real one, and it should be tackled at the border itself, so that these goods do not reach the European market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I support the concept of an accelerated procedure enabling the customs authorities to prevent the movement of goods which they suspect are fake, with the proviso, however, that these rules will not be applied to consumers, passengers or their luggage or to packages for exclusive personal use and weighing not more than two kilogrammes. Consumers should be protected, but they should also be able to have free access to commercial proposals without fear of accidentally infringing the law. The Commission proposal is a good first step towards protecting European intellectual property and is a sensible alternative to ACTA.</p>

Where is the strengthening of external border controls which was promised in exchange for the dismantling of EU internal border controls? The explosion in imports of counterfeit goods is the direct consequence of the EU’s ultra free market policies and, in particular, of it having accepted China, the world’s greatest counterfeiter, into the WTO. The first action that should be taken is to restore real custom-controlled borders, providing real commercial protection at European and national level. Otherwise, what the EU is proposing will be more like stopgap measures than a real solution.

It is vital that customs administrations – i.e. those men and women charged with protecting which goods enter and exit European territory – have as many clear and understandable tools as possible at their disposal, and this regulation should support this.

      <p sl="en">I welcome the rapporteur’s decision to vote now and I hope we will be able to reach a deal with the Council soon on this important issue. My approach on this important report has been to further strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property rights in customs, against attempts by the S&amp;D Group and the Greens/EFA Group to water it down.</p>
      <p sl="en">Intellectual property rights are fundamental for innovation, jobs and growth in Europe and it is of great importance that we ensure the correct mechanisms are in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">I tabled amendments stressing that national customs authorities have limited resources and that it was therefore important to ensure that no new additional burdens were placed on them. I also focused on improving efficiency by stressing the importance of using risk management technologies in identifying infringements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the rapporteur’s view on including parallel trade in the scope. However, I disagree with the approach of reversing the burden of proof to the holder or declarant concerning goods in transit. I am happy to vote in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Product piracy is an increasingly common occurrence. The global network has made it easy for vendors to supply a worldwide market and the result has been a huge increase in counterfeit and pirated products. The number of registered cases of counterfeiting and piracy in 2010 was double the figure for 2009 and amounts to 79 112 cases. There was an increase of 200% in online sales. The estimated annual cost of counterfeiting and piracy for European businesses is EUR 250 billion. A total of 85% of the items that breach intellectual property rights come from China and there is a large market for them in Europe. It is therefore the responsibility of the European customs authorities to scrutinise goods which come from the Far East in particular with very great care. As I am of the opinion that the new regulation does not get to the root of the problem and that consumers could be turned into criminals from the start instead of being educated, I have abstained.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann on customs protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), as I agree that protecting these rights in external trade relations is vital to the European economy, the competitiveness of which is based on innovation and the differentiation guaranteed by trademarks, patents, copyright and designations of geographical origin. In the first instance, it falls to the EU’s customs authorities to prevent pirated or counterfeit products from entering the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also agree that goods in transit should not be excluded from customs control, at least in cases where it may be suspected that these are intended for the internal market. Furthermore, I believe that it makes no sense to prevent the EU from seizing goods which infringe intellectual property rights that are protected within the EU, such as European trademarks, simply because they are intended for other markets, as no less damage is caused to the European companies that hold those rights. The case of generic medicines in transit to developing countries, under the relevant derogation clause of the World Trade Organisation’s intellectual property (TRIPS) agreement, is not at issue here because there is no infringement of the IPR of European pharmaceutical companies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Intellectual property rights are of fundamental importance for innovation and, therefore, for growth, because businesses must be able to rely on receiving a financial return on the investment that they make in developing and manufacturing a new or improved product. The growing number of violations of the law and the increase in international trade in products that infringe intellectual property rights mean that a large proportion of the economic growth and jobs in the EU depend on intellectual property rights being properly enforced. The estimated annual cost of counterfeiting and piracy for European businesses is around EUR 250 billion. Alongside the negative consequences for businesses and their employees, there is also a significant risk to the health and safety of consumers. In 2010, a total of 14.5% of the items that were confiscated were goods that represented a potential danger for the health and safety of consumers, such as foods, toiletries, medicines, household electrical goods and toys. The customs authorities are in a relatively strong position when it comes to confiscating counterfeit products before they reach the internal market. However, once these products are inside the European Union, it becomes much more difficult and more expensive to remove them from the market. From a consumer perspective, the report is too stringent. It would be better to focus on effective education in this area rather than turning consumers into criminals right from the start. Therefore, I have abstained from voting.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Customs authorities have a special role to play in properly protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) by combating the illegal entry of goods and counterfeit products into the single market. Consequently, every effort must be made to enhance customs authorities’ intellectual property rights enforcement procedures, properly protect traders’ interests and stop abuse and piracy. It is very important for measures to combat IPR infringements at the EU’s external borders to be combined with targeted efforts at source.

It essentially aims to strengthen the role of the customs authorities in both monitoring and enforcing IPR legislation at the EU’s external borders, before the goods enter the internal market.

The uniform application of these regulations and the resulting effective supervision of the internal market is needed for maintaining the competitiveness of European firms. Counterfeits from third countries cost our businesses about EUR 250 billion annually, and the number of counterfeits has doubled in recent years, reducing the opportunities for growth and job creation in the European economy. I am concerned that, instead of effective approaches such as increasing the resources of customs bodies in particular, efforts are put into negotiating an Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement which will be ineffective in practice due to the absence of China and other states. Last but not least, any instruments for the better enforcement of intellectual property rights must, at the same time, respect the freedoms contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.</p>

The biggest criticisms we have: the scope is much too wide; for us it should be limited to real counterfeited trademarks and not cover other IPRs such as patents, plant variety, etc.; it is not up to the customs officials to enforce those rights, it is the responsibility of rights holders to proceed; goods in transit should not be concerned; developing countries have legitimate concerns regarding the interception of goods, in particular medicines, which are in transit and not intended for marketing in the EU: such interceptions interrupt the supply of generic medicines which these countries need; parallel trade should be allowed: it is allowed under the TRIPS agreement and therefore, there must be a derogation for parallel trade, in particular, because it can contribute to lowering the cost of medicines in developing countries.</p>

I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann because it deals precisely and clearly with an extremely important issue, by seeking to simplify the regulatory framework that currently exists, so as to make measures to combat counterfeiting more effective and rigorous. Consumer protection, facilitation of the work of customs authorities, protection of intellectual property rights and combating fraud are the keystones on which European policy in this sector must rest.

      <p sl="pl">Counterfeit goods are a result of the grey market – they are not subject to customs controls and do not meet applicable standards in terms of established quality norms, and so do not meet health and safety criteria. Protecting intellectual property rights and reducing the inflow of counterfeit goods will help create fairer conditions for competition and encourage growth in jobs, while also helping to increase tax revenues. Special measures are required for international postal traffic involving medicines. Intellectual property also has a broader aspect, which is hard to understand in terms of the free single market. Further action and measures are needed in this area.

I voted for Amendment 5, which stipulates that Member States should allocate sufficient resources to enable customs authorities to carry out their extended responsibilities and provide appropriate training for customs officials. The Commission and Member States should adopt guidelines to ensure the correct and uniform implementation of customs controls for the different types of rights infringements covered by this regulation. I voted for Amendment 6, which states that, when fully implemented, this regulation must contribute, to a larger extent, to creating a single market which ensures more effective protection for rights holders, fuels creativity and innovation, and provides consumers with reliable, high-quality products, which should, in turn, help strengthen cross-border transactions between consumers, businesses and retailers.</p>

Europe as a whole extracts only around 13 per cent of its total available water, but the geographic distribution of resources is very uneven and many European countries and regions are subject to heavy water stress.

I support the position of the rapporteur that regional water consumption data must be considered when setting new rules.

Since, in many places in Europe, water abstraction is going beyond sustainable levels, threatening wildlife and the safety of supply to society, the proposed measures need to be taken. I agree that it is important to collect reliable data about water availability, reinforce the Water Information System for Europe (WISE) and encourage innovation and research in the area of water protection and availability. I welcome the proposal to regulate in EU legislation the reuse and recycling of water, taking into account technological advances, and to remove inconsistencies among the WFD, the Nitrates Directive and the REACH Regulation, as well as Natura 2000, and reinforce international commitments on sustainable development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Water is undoubtedly the most important of all public goods. The adoption of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in 2000 means the EU has a solid framework for sustainable and efficient management of water resources. However, the pace at which the WFD has been implemented in EU Member States and regions has been very slow. In November 2012, the Commission will table a plan to preserve Europe’s water resources, with the aim of addressing current and future challenges to water resources. This report, which is Parliament’s contribution to the Commission’s plan, advocates strengthening the regional and local dimension, and involving local communities and stakeholders, participating actively at all stages in the process of setting out and implementing policy. It also advocates a holistic approach to protecting water resources, in particular, drinking water. As such, the water issue should be integrated into all policy areas at EU, national and regional level. I voted for this report for those reasons.</p>

In this context, I believe that Parliament must make an active contribution to the process leading to the establishment of the future direction of European water policy. Decisive action at EU level is needed to address current and future water challenges faced by our continent.

Local communities should play an active part in water policy design and implementation. For successful recovery of costs and monitoring of waste, transparent pricing schemes should be introduced and we need to aim to reuse water for agricultural and domestic purposes. Sound management of water resources is based on collecting reliable data, not just on quality, but, above all, on the quantity of water available. This becomes possible through the integration of water-related objectives at all legislative levels, in EU and local spheres. Metering and ecodesign will help to bring about the efficiency of public and industrial water systems and, in general, all ecosystem services supported by water.</p>

Equitable water management is essential for ensuring that all ecosystems receive a sufficient quantity of good quality water to function properly and provide essential services to our society and economy. Current trends in water use are often unsustainable due to inefficient practices resulting in water wastage. Water infrastructure systems are often outdated, whether in the most developed regions or in the less developed regions. There is also a lack of information about actual performance and losses. Furthermore, inadequately cleaned wastewater continues to pollute the seas around the shores of the EU, so that it is essential to speed up the development of sewage treatment infrastructure in the Member States. The Europe 2020 strategy stipulates a more responsible use of resources. The future of industry in Europe depends on finding effective responses to the current water challenges and on managing existing water resources, which directly affect human health, energy production, agriculture and food security, both responsibly and efficiently.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The problems of dwindling drinking water resources and expanding deserts, which were more likely in the past to be issues affecting Africa and Asia, are now also encountered in Europe. In southern Spain, the desert is extending by one kilometre every year. Oltenia in Romania is exposed to a similar process, but it is progressing at a slower rate, while drinking water resources in other regions of the world have become grounds for conflict between states. Protecting water resources, especially drinking water, must be tackled from a global perspective, taking into account all the ecosystem services supported by water. It is important that pollution is controlled at source, in order to prevent hazardous substances from entering the environment and reduce the strain placed on wastewater treatment. In view of the abovementioned problems, I think that the sustainable use of water is as much an economic as an environmental necessity, which would require more transparent water pricing schemes.</p>

The adoption of a lifestyle which uses less water should be a priority for European citizens in order to protect this finite resource.

Protection of water resources, with particular reference to drinking water, needs to be addressed from a global perspective, taking into account all the ecosystem services supported by water.

This is an essential resource for all of humankind, as it is used for human consumption, agriculture and industry, so all necessary measures should be taken to protect it. In view of this, in 2000, the EU approved the Water Framework Directive, which established a reasonable framework for its protection and use. Twelve years later, it is important to improve various aspects, both in relation to quality controls and with regard to management at regional and, in certain cases, macro-regional level. Another aspect that requires urgent attention from the responsible bodies is optimising supply systems, given that it is estimated that 70% of water supplied is lost.

This is a matter of preventing water from being controlled by the few, and making it instead a resource owned by everyone, for everyone. I also believe that it is a resource that should be at the service of the community and the whole planet.</p>

This is the only way in which they can function effectively and provide important services for food security, health, society and the economy. We urgently need to monitor the state of the European water network in order to assess its quality, deterioration and interconnectivity, given the possibility that as much as 70% of the water supplied to European cities is wasted as a result of leaks in the water system. Therefore, it is also important to ensure that the quality of water across all the EU countries is roughly the same. However, I am opposed to interfering with the Member States’ control over their own water supplies. It will, of course, be important to take measures to improve water efficiency in buildings, for example, so that water is not wasted unnecessarily. We also need to take agriculture into consideration, which requires large volumes of water, so we must promote water-saving processes and technologies as far as possible. It would also be beneficial to run campaigns to explain to citizens where and how they can effectively save water. As I believe in improving the legislation on water and I am assuming that there will be successful results in the near future, I have voted in favour of the motion.</p>

      <p sl="it">Water is a precious and unique resource, which is vital for the very existence of life: it is therefore clear that it is advisable to take a joint European approach to the protection and defence of this asset. Firstly, in the knowledge that this is a resource that is scarce, we need to endeavour to ensure that its use is optimised and wastage is reduced as far as possible: it is not acceptable, for example, for an obsolete transport and distribution system to lead to the waste of enormous quantities of water. In Tuscany this spring, there was a serious drought: unfortunately, droughts have been experienced many times in recent years, and are primarily caused by mismanagement of the water network. The report also stresses the importance of water reuse and recycling, and the need to ensure that pollution does not compromise water quality, and thus the ecosystem as a whole. Unfortunately, there are still many cases today of negligence and inexperience, which might lead to the complete destruction of natural areas: Massaciuccoli Lake is a dramatic example of this, since its valuable habitat is in serious danger, as the Commission itself emphasised to me in reply to a recent question I put to it.</p>

However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this Parliament has not had the opportunity to express its point of view by means of an opinion. European farmers are open to discussing the difficulties in this area and implementing the solutions needed for better water management, but their opinions must be heard and taken into account.

The resolution focuses, in particular, on the use of incentive schemes such as the application of the ‘polluter pays’ and ‘user pays’ principles and the implementation of transparent and effective pricing schemes that would internalise both wastewater treatment and environmental costs. It is important to remember, however, that this must not result in ill-considered increases in water prices. The text also mentions proposals with respect to shale gas exploration and extraction, which is a problem that particularly concerns France given that it has large quantities of the resource underground.

I think that water is a public asset which is essential for life, and its appropriate management plays a key role in protecting the world’s natural assets and existing ecosystems. Europe currently abstracts around 13% of its total available freshwater, which is already an indication of some water stress. In many places in Europe, water abstraction is going below sustainable levels, threatening wildlife and water supply security for society, while in some regions of southern Europe, the water exploitation index has risen above 40%. The future of industry in Europe depends on finding effective responses to the current water challenges and on managing existing water resources, which directly affect human health, energy production, agriculture and food security, in a responsible, efficient manner. I should point out the link between energy production, energy efficiency and water security. I should stress that strategies need to be adopted at EU level to ensure that the ever increasing demand for energy does not pose a risk to the security and sustainable availability of water.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Road safety is a major issue for society and a vital aspect of EU-level transport policy. The harmonised implementation of an interoperable pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system has been on the Commission’s agenda since 2005, but has only become a priority now. According to the official statistics about eCall, it is estimated that the system’s complete integration into cars in EU Member States will save roughly 2 500 lives every year, while also reducing the severity of injuries by 10-15%.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The eCall system will be a great help to road users who are unfamiliar with the roads and their exact location in the case of an accident. It will also allow emergency calls to be made without language difficulties, based on the digital data enclosed in the Minimum Set of Data (MSD) message format, which should reduce misunderstandings. I think that every effort needs to be made so that the implementation of eCall is made compulsory in every Member State and it becomes a reliable, high-quality, affordable and easy-to-use service across the whole of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Road safety regulation can and must continue to be improved. I therefore call for the eCall emergency call system to be made compulsory in cars. These eCall systems should be installed free of charge in all new cars by 2015 with a view to notifying the emergency services of road accidents automatically, via a 112 emergency call. In addition to seatbelts and airbags, eCall would reduce the consequences of road accidents by automatically informing emergency services in the event of a collision. The accident location could therefore be immediately communicated and emergency services could intervene quicker. Naturally, vehicles would only be localised in the event of an accident and not at other times.</p>

      <p sl="ga">I voted in favour of this report and what it says about improving the system for eCall and the emergency services.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I support the rapporteur’s recommendation that eCall be provided in the form of an emergency public service available free to all drivers in Europe, regardless of their type of car.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The main advantage of the eCall service is the resulting reduction in road traffic deaths and severity of injuries thanks to a faster response from the emergency services in case of accidents. It is clear that more people could be saved, and the consequences of accidents lessened, if the emergency response time could be reduced.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The eCall service would also help to clear accident sites faster, reducing the risk of further accidents on the same site.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Since there are very significant benefits associated with this service, Member States and national authorities must do their best to ensure the widespread roll-out and use of the service.</p>

I agree that the Member States should upgrade their emergency response service infrastructures by 2015 so that these services could introduce appropriate equipment enabling them to handle eCalls. I agree that the system should be free of charge and that a public eCall service could coexist with private emergency services.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report because I think that installing an eCall service will improve road safety and provide considerable benefits for the whole of society. Its introduction is especially important as the number of victims of road accidents continues to rise. An emergency call from the system will ensure that assistance is provided more quickly in the event of a serious accident, while also reducing the severity of the injuries. It would also have a positive impact on handling incidents by helping prevent secondary accidents or reducing traffic congestion. I should highlight that the system’s complete integration into cars will save roughly 2 500 lives a year.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this context, I should emphasise how important it is to develop a reliable, affordable and easy-to-use service for all road users. Since its positive impact has already been proven by numerous studies, I think that the eCall system should be made compulsory.</p>

      <p sl="pt">From 2015, all cars sold in the EU should have an emergency call system in case of a serious accident. The system will automatically transfer data about the location of the vehicle and the time of the accident to the nearest emergency service. By adopting this report, we will be helping because the emergency services will reach the scene of the accident faster. Owing to the faster arrival of assistance, we will also see a reduction in the medical consequences of a crash, the mitigation of the risk of further accidents at the scene, and reduced traffic congestion. I would stress that any added in-vehicle application based on the eCall telematics platform should comply fully with the relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

      <p sl="en">I extend a cautious welcome to the call for the European Commission to compel all new cars from 2015 to be fitted with the eCall system, which automatically alerts emergency services to serious road crashes when airbags are deployed. The United States are currently leading in the deployment of telematics of this kind, with 50% of cars sold now fitted. In the EU, most manufacturers do not include them. Therefore, the mandatory introduction of eCall seems necessary for large-scale deployment in Europe. However, the whole rescue chain has to be ‘eCall ready’ by 2015 from mobile phone systems to emergency control centres. On top of that, I strongly opposed extending the scope of eCall deployment to motorbikes, tractors and industrial vehicles. Motorbikes do not have airbags and are almost always separated from their riders in an accident. As for tractors and industrial vehicles, the purpose of the vehicle is to bump into things, I do not see how it is possible to install eCall on these type of vehicles without triggering false alarms to emergency response teams. The ALDE Group’s efforts to remove these categories from the recommendation were not successful at this time, but I will try to ensure that if any legislation follows, these vehicles will stay out of the scope. The ALDE Group also asked for a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of eCall, which we are still awaiting.</p>

      <p sl="it">Private in-vehicle emergency call services were introduced in Europe in the late 90s. Despite the fact that these services have fully demonstrated their usefulness, deployment in Europe is below 0.4% of the vehicle fleet. In addition, private emergency call services do not cover all countries in Europe: when vehicles travel into countries where the service is not provided by the private party, the service is discontinued. In view of this, the Commission decided to take legislative action to introduce a mandatory eCall. The benefits of introducing such systems for citizens are clear: a reduction in the number of fatalities and the mitigation of the severity of injuries caused by road accidents due to faster arrival of the emergency services on the accident scene and shorter rescue times, which will enable the accident scene to be cleared more quickly, lessening the impact of accidents on traffic and reducing the risk of further accidents at the scene. I welcome the introduction of eCall, provided that any added in-vehicle application based on the eCall platform complies with the regulations on data protection and privacy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The 112 service is a very good tool in emergencies. It is available, or at least should be available, from all telephone equipment and in every Member State. However, people who have been injured in road accidents are very often not able themselves to report this to the emergency services. This led to the design of the eCall system, in which vehicles are fitted with special equipment which automatically reports involvement in a road accident. Unfortunately, work on implementing the system, which has been going on for nearly a decade, has still not brought results. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support acceleration of this work, both in terms of administration of the system and in terms of the technology involved, in order to make a full eCall service available throughout the Union as soon as possible. I am sure that this will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the rescue services, and will reduce the risk of loss of life and health of those caught up in accidents. It will also allow the efficient reorganisation of traffic at places where accidents have occurred. The service must be free, must be a public service and must be available in all vehicles regardless of their manufacturer. The system will also provide administrative benefits in the form of a reduction in the medical costs associated with accidents and a lower risk of secondary accidents and the resultant congestion. I support the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Koch and Ms Sehnalová calling on the Commission to propose legislation to introduce the eCall system in all type-approved cars in the EU as from 2015. This system makes an automatic call for help throughout Europe in the event of an accident and where the driver is prevented from doing so. I agree with the statement in the report that eCall will facilitate a significant reduction in the number of fatalities caused by road accidents. Moreover, I share the view that, as the Commission has amply demonstrated, the reasons against its introduction advanced by the United Kingdom, France and Poland are unfounded. These reasons concerned the fear of a breach of privacy, its effective functioning in all European countries and protecting the interests of car manufacturers already offering comparable private systems.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the deployment of an EU-wide eCall service available in all vehicles and in all countries has been a major priority for the Union in the context of road safety since 2002. The major benefit of eCall will be a reduction in the number of fatalities and the mitigation of the severity of injuries caused by road accidents due to the speedier arrival of the emergency services at the accident scene. According to official statistical data on eCall, it is estimated that the full introduction of the system in cars in EU Member States would save 2 500 lives annually, while reducing the severity of injuries by 10-15%. However, the mandatory deployment of a public eCall should not be based or made conditional on the existence of a positive business case for the standalone eCall service. Its benefits for society as a whole should also be considered. eCall should be a public emergency call service, free of charge, for the benefit of any driver in Europe regardless of his make of car. A mandatory public eCall could be the enabler for the take-off of many other commercial services, which are ready for the market but still need a killer application to be successful. Therefore, eCall could support additional public or private telematic services providing further safety and economic benefits.</p>

If it is used on a large scale, the eCall service will help save hundreds of lives in Europe every year and reduce the severity of the injuries and trauma in tens of thousands of cases.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on the eCall system: a new ‘112’ service for citizens. This system constitutes a genuine technological advance: it enables an emergency call to be automatically triggered, whether the car is damaged or not, whilst sending out a message including key information about the accident, such as time, accurate location, driving direction, vehicle description and whether the passengers are conscious or not. This system, which can also be activated manually, functions on the basis of the single European emergency number 112 combined with the vehicle’s satellite positioning. According to estimations, the implementation of such a system in cars should save the lives of 2 500 EU citizens annually and reduce the severity of injuries by 10 to 15% due to better responsiveness from emergency services. The eCall system is dormant until an emergency call is triggered. The principles of privacy and protection of personal data are therefore fully respected, this being an essential condition for the system’s adoption. Furthermore, technological neutrality is guaranteed with eCall so that car manufacturers can remain free to choose the system they install in their vehicles.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The reason why I voted in favour of introducing the eCall system is the need to speed up the arrival of the emergency services, save lives and reduce the injuries caused by road accidents. According to estimates, the eCall system could save up to 2 500 lives a year. The required technology is already available at EU level, and the Commission is making Member States update their response systems so that they can handle eCall calls by 2015. My view is that eCall should be a free public emergency call service for the benefit of every passenger in Europe, no matter what make of car they drive. The faster arrival of rescue teams, the police and recovery firms allows the accident scene to be cleared more quickly, thereby reducing external costs. The benefits of eCall for public authorities lie in the reduction of the medical consequences of an accident, of the risk of a further accident at the same location and of the impact of an accident on traffic. Similarly, in the case of the car industry, introducing an eCall service on a compulsory basis in every new type-approved vehicle will open up new opportunities for implementing additional services offering added value.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The deployment of the eCall service, based on the 112 emergency number, should ensure the automatic notification of the emergency services in the event of a serious accident. As such, it will make a key contribution to reducing the number of fatalities on European roads, as well as mitigating the consequences of injuries due to faster, qualified and properly equipped assistance. This pan-European emergency call service from vehicles should operate in all Member States and European countries associated with this initiative, and should be available in any vehicle, irrespective of make, country or actual location of the vehicle. Initially, this service was expected to be completely operational by 2009. Unfortunately, progress has been too slow, and the roll-out of the pan-European eCall service has been further delayed. It is therefore imperative to ensure that this system, which is considered one of the most efficient yet low-cost as regards road safety, can be deployed in a timely and streamlined manner across Europe, as is indeed desired by 80% of citizens surveyed.

The eCall service seeks to address that need with regard to road accidents. At a time when mobile phones are widespread, it is incomprehensible that studies are not being carried out or assistance-alert solutions being applied that take the existence of mobile technology into account and take advantage of its full potential. The automatic nature of the service’s activation raises some doubts in my mind as to the privacy of the occupants of vehicles and the traceability of their journeys.

The aim of this measure is to save human lives, and it makes installing an alert system in motor vehicles obligatory. In the event of an accident, and similar to what already happens in certain high-end vehicles, this system triggers an emergency call and transmits the coordinates of the damaged vehicle’s location. How many people might survive if they were attended to at the time of the accident? How many people have been trapped, often in inhospitable and/or undisclosed places, bleeding and unable to ask for help?

During this call, the emergency service operator will be able to speak and hear what is happening inside the vehicle. This technology enables access to a range of geographical data about location and direction, which are collated and monitored in real time via satellite.

      <p sl="it">Parliament’s adoption of the report recommending deployment of the eCall system is a clear signal of its support for the topic of road safety. Every year in Europe, there are more than 40 000 fatalities on the roads. By means of the eCall system, it is anticipated that this number could be reduced by more than 2 500, with a reduction of 10-15% in the number of injured, thanks to an increase of 40-50% in the speed and efficiency of response centres. Furthermore, it is important to remember that eCall will have minimal economic repercussions on final costs, which amount to about EUR 100 per vehicle – a perfectly reasonable price given the great benefits it will bring. It is now essential that the Member States and the respective mobile phone networks commit themselves to improving their infrastructure so as to guarantee this service to the maximum extent possible. As of now, 5 500 drivers have use of such a service in 10 countries: the positive effects achievable from 2015 with its introduction in all 27 Member States would be of vital importance.</p>

      <p sl="sk">More than 40 000 people die every year in road accidents. 150 000 people suffer an injury that results in permanent disability. According to predictions made by the World Bank and the World Health Organisation, the number of traffic accident victims is expected to rise in every area of the world and, by 2020, it will be the third most common cause of death. These predictions are alarming. In the face of such adverse developments, the EU cannot just stand idly by. This is why I am in favour of the introduction of the pan-European eCall system. Indeed, according to official statistical data on eCall, it is estimated that the full integration of the system in cars in EU Member States will save up to 2 500 lives annually, while also reducing the severity of injuries by 10-15%. This will be due to the more rapid arrival of the emergency services at the scene of the accident. eCall will reduce the time spent in traffic congestion and will contribute to the efficiency of road transport in the EU. The service will also allow the support of many other commercial services enhancing safety and economic benefits.</p>
      <p sl="sk">At the same time, it no less important to ensure that the system is in full compliance with the relevant regulations on data protection and privacy. Also, if the service is to fulfil its purpose, namely, to reduce the number of deaths and mitigate the severity of injuries in traffic accidents, it must always be free of charge and for the benefit of all drivers, irrespective of the make of vehicle.</p>

      <p sl="en">While eCall could be a beneficial and welcome demonstration of how smart technology can be used in vehicles to potentially save lives following an accident on any European road, there are many flaws in this report that have still not been adequately addressed. This system should be voluntary. European citizens who purchase a car should be given the choice to pay for this technology to be fitted along with the optional extras which are already offered by vehicle manufacturers. A mandatory introduction would mean increased vehicle costs for citizens who may not want this device fitted. There is also an issue regarding the infrastructure and the high levels of investment needed to ensure full coverage across the EU. There are still huge signal black spots at cross border areas and areas with low population density where this system is promoted as being most needed. There have been no answers forthcoming regarding these costs. These points must be addressed before the Commission considers bringing forward a legislative proposal on the introduction of eCall to new vehicles with a mandatory implementation date of January 2015.</p>

      <p sl="de">Particularly when EU citizens travel to another country, they often do not know exactly where they are and do not always speak the language.

      <p sl="fr">I hope that this technology will be implemented quickly in order to save lives. The ‘eCall’ system, which is the result of research financed by the European Union, is a small device based on the use of in-vehicle sensors. In the event of a serious accident, this device automatically dials the European emergency number, 112. The vehicle’s location and direction and the time of the accident are transmitted directly to the public safety answering point. Member States must then be allowed to choose how they organise the routing of calls, for example, either via the intermediary of a sorting platform, which distinguishes emergency calls requiring public service from those requiring assistance to be met by a private service provider. A pan-EU eCall service would enable emergency services to save time: 40% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas, according to the European Commission. While 30 900 deaths and over 1.5 million injured persons were recorded on EU roads in 2010 and 2009 respectively, eCall would reduce the number of deaths by at least 4% and severe injuries by at least 6%.</p>

This public device automatically contacts the emergency services in the event of serious accidents, reducing the death toll, the severity of injuries and the number of secondary accidents. We have been supporting this idea since 2003, but it has been hampered by the manufacturers’ lobby, as they wanted to develop an optional, private system.

      <p sl="fr">On Tuesday, 3 July, Parliament voted by a large majority for the development of the eCall technology, which will be fitted to all new vehicles by 2015. Using in-vehicle sensors, in case of a serious accident, the eCall system automatically alerts the nearest emergency service via the 112 call platform. eCall will provide key information to speed up the intervention of the mobile emergency services, such as the time, accurate location and information about the vehicle. eCall can also be activated manually, for example, in case of a heart attack. This free system will not be permanently operational. There will, therefore, be no risk of violation of personal data or of monitoring of movements. Thanks to this new device, over 2 500 lives could be saved each year and the emergency services will intervene more rapidly. Whilst it will be several years before this system is fully operational, in my opinion, this is a practical initiative that responds directly to citizens’ concerns.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We Swedish Conservatives voted against the own-initiative report on eCall today. The purpose of eCall is to make it easier, via computerisation, for the emergency services to get to the scene of an accident quickly. The intention is for it to be possible to trace vehicles that are involved in road traffic accidents. If an accident happens, it will be indicated at the nearest public safety answering point, wherever you happen to be in Europe. However, this service already exists on the market. Several car manufacturers already make cars with this service included. We therefore believe that the EU does not need to take a decision on this. Installation of eCall would involve increased costs for motorists, as cars would be more expensive to manufacture. It should be up to individual motorists to choose for themselves whether they want this service in their cars and therefore to pay for a more expensive car. From a privacy perspective, this also means that motorists can be monitored. If someone chooses this system as a consumer, it is a voluntary contract between the customer and the company. However, if it is decided upon by the EU, then it forces monitoring on people, which is something that we Swedish Conservatives did not feel able to support.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution because the aim of the in-vehicle eCall system is to ensure the automatic notification of the emergency services in the event of a serious accident, with the purpose of reducing road fatalities and alleviating the severity of road injuries by the earlier arrival of qualified and equipped assistance (the ‘golden hour’ principle). Based on data in the European Union for 2004, more than 40 000 people die every year in accidents and 150 000 people suffer permanent disability. eCall does not prevent accidents, but would improve the effectiveness of emergency services. When emergency services are promptly notified and know the accident location, they can arrive quickly and reduce the risk of death and the severity of injuries. It should be noted that numerous studies and projects based on scientific methodology underscore the positive safety effects of eCall. The eCall service should be free of charge and its installation in all new vehicles should be obligatory. The public eCall service should be simple, affordable, operational and accessible to everybody throughout the EU, regardless of the vehicle and its location.</p>

If it will be possible to save an estimated 2 500 lives per year and reduce the number of serious injuries, then this must be a good system. However, as always, it is important to evaluate the practicability of the plan. Is it really possible for the system only to be activated in the event of a serious accident? What constitutes a serious accident? Is the car drivers’ data really secure? And, most importantly, what will the mandatory introduction of the emergency call system cost? I would ask everyone to think carefully about these and any other questions that arise. I would also like to emphasise once again how much I welcome this system, particularly as I cover long distances every week in my car.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The benefits of eCall are mostly demonstrated to be the reduction of the medical consequences of a crash, the reduced risk of a further accident on the scene and the reduced impact of an accident on the traffic.

      <p sl="pl">For the system to work, we are going to need cooperation between vehicle manufacturers, mobile network operators and the Member States.

We are right to stress that the eCall system must not, under any circumstances, allow the journey of a vehicle to be traced, by which we mean that it must remain a dormant system until an emergency call is triggered. The eCall service cannot be used in any way to monitor and study a person’s movements or determine his location unless that person has been involved in an accident. I endorsed this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">The fundamental idea of an emergency service that calls the nearest public safety answering point automatically is a good one, but, as is so often the case, there are gaps in the idea which need to be closed before the system can be regarded as perfect. We live in an age when we can and must expect the highest standards in technological terms. I am of the opinion that every Member State should decide for itself whether it wants to fit this system in cars, because it involves certain risks. It is important to remember that there is a risk that the system will be activated in the case of every accident, even if it is ‘just’ a rear-end collision. When it makes a call, the emergency services will arrive and find out that there is ‘only’ damage to the vehicles and this may prevent them from reaching the scene of another accident in good time. We need to bear this in mind. Furthermore, the system should officially only be activated when it is needed, but it is difficult to establish this in advance. There is a risk of it being misused, even in stand-by mode. I see this as a breach of privacy, because the eCall system can be used to identify where people are and how fast they are driving, for example.

These shocking statistics show us how dramatic the situation is and how important it therefore is to find ways of improving it. The report that we adopted today, and which I willingly supported, provides for the introduction of an automatic alarm system: when installed in a vehicle that has been involved in an accident, eCall will, in fact, send an alert concerning the event by making an encoded emergency call to the 112 number, which has now become the single European number for emergencies, valid, that is, in all Member States. Clearly, this will not help to prevent accidents, but it will certainly help rescue teams, for whom rapid and timely reaction is essential, to become more effective. Estimates indicate that it may be possible to save 2 500 human lives every year by means of this system.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour. It is my view that from 2015, eCall should be installed in all new models of cars and light vehicles and should function fully throughout the EU, as well as in other European countries wishing to use it. In Lithuania alone, there are more than 6 000 car accidents each year, in which more than 8 000 people are injured and almost 700 killed. The introduction from 2015 of the eCall system in all cars in EU Member States would save 2 500 lives a year, while reducing the severity of injuries by 10-15%. The introduction of the eCall system in a new car would cost less than EUR 100, but the driver should not have to shoulder the financial burden and the eCall service must be free of charge. The system does not send any signals and is completely dormant until sensors detect that a serious accident has taken place and automatically transmit a signal, even if, following the accident, the driver or passenger is unconscious. It will also be possible for a person who has witnessed the accident to activate the system by pressing a button. Research shows that when this technology is applied, rescuers arrive 40% quicker in urban areas and 50% quicker in rural areas. It is regrettable that over the course of more than five years, the voluntary deployment of this system has not produced any results.</p>

      <p sl="sk">More than 39 000 lives are lost and more than 1.2 million passengers are injured every year in road accidents across the EU. These alarming statistics point to the fact that road safety concerns all EU citizens. Our task is therefore to support proposals that would reduce the death rate in road accidents and would constitute a step forward in ensuring road safety. The eCall system is a modern, intelligent traffic safety system, the role of which is to automatically call the emergency services in the event of an accident without the driver, who may be injured or unconscious, having to lift a finger. The speedy and timely intervention of the emergency services is often crucial. In the case of serious injuries, every minute counts. The eCall system represents a major challenge for the transport policies of the EU Member States. In view of the time that the EU has spent since 2003 trying to develop a system in detail, it is high time for it to be finally harmonised across all Member States. The only downside may be the slightly higher costs when purchasing a vehicle, but one must realise that in mass production, it would be a marginal amount which is negligible compared to the number of lives saved.</p>

Parliament has come out clearly in support of all motorists in Europe, so that they can benefit from a free emergency call system. Given that the voluntary approach has failed to produce results, the Commission is being urged to put forward legislative measures as soon as possible to ensure that the eCall system becomes obligatory in all EU countries by 2015. In the resolution, the Commission is invited to consider the possibility of extending the system in the near future to other vehicles, such as motorcycles, buses, coaches and lorries. This system uses the technology of 112 emergency calls so as to automatically alert the emergency services of the location of the vehicle in the event of a serious accident, thereby saving lives, reducing the severity of injuries and also ensuring the arrival of qualified and fully equipped paramedics within an hour of the accident, under what is known as the ‘golden hour principle’. The eCall system will enable around 2 500 lives to be saved every year.

      <p sl="et">The objective of eCall is to ensure the automatic notification of emergency services from inside a vehicle in the case of an accident, in order to reduce the number of casualties from traffic accidents and mitigate the seriousness of injuries sustained in traffic accidents. eCall will speed up the arrival of qualified and properly equipped assistance. The application of eCall technology must be compulsory and available to all drivers of vehicles in the European Union. It is also important that vehicles imported into Europe from third countries should be required to have eCall technology. eCall technology must be installed in all new cars. eCall technology is based on the 112 emergency number, and must be compulsory and free of charge for all. Parliament is calling on the European Commission to acknowledge the need to develop, by the end of 2012, a directive that would include the implementation of eCall. In order to mitigate the problems associated with the introduction of eCall, the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have called upon Member States to cooperate with the European Commission to plan and implement national pilot programmes for the utilisation of the European in-car automatic emergency call system (eCall), in order to address all of the problems that may arise.</p>

Although reducing road accidents and saving lives is a priority for me, it is obvious that nothing comes for free in this world, and somebody always has to pick up the bill. The proposal in Articles 9 and 39 for eCall to be free of charge is therefore problematic, as it suggests that, in the case of new vehicles, calls would be payment-free – where there is no problem because they are free already – and so would the equipment. In view of the fact that someone will have to pay for it, we will see either a further assault on public finances or higher prices for vehicles, if the burden is transferred to car makers, who will pass it on. The issue of possible costs for the emergency services from false alarms is also rather problematic, a fact pointed out by the rapporteurs themselves.

Whilst some manufacturers have already adopted comparable systems, I see no value in our making them incompatible with eCall. Let us avoid a war amongst the lobbies to impose a system when so many lives are at stake. If eCall must be technology neutral, it must also be financially neutral. This innovation cannot be achieved to the detriment of the consumer. The system aims to be general and obligatory. In these circumstances, we cannot impose an unreasonable cost on future buyers. I also think it is essential to introduce the conditions for free and fair competition to avoid the appearance of unfair charges.

      <p sl="fr">Another topic in this plenary sitting shows that the strategy for growth, jobs and the competitiveness of our companies is under way. It has not waited for the French socialists. I voted in favour of a text whose objective is to attract foreign investors to Europe. Even though Europe remains the main destination region for foreign direct investment, weak economic growth, high taxation and high public debt accumulation raise concerns to investors. We must ensure that businesses can compete openly and fairly, promote the entrepreneurial spirit amongst local entrepreneurs and fully exploit the Structural Funds. The growing difficulties faced by SMEs in accessing funding show us that there is a need to encourage investment in the real economy. As Parliament’s rapporteur on the motion for a resolution on the Social Business Initiative – creating a favourable climate for social enterprises, key stakeholders in the social economy and innovation, it is this form of support that I wish to provide to social enterprises. I also welcome the political agreement that was reached on my report last week, an agreement that was arrived at thanks especially to the constructive proposals put forward by the Commission and by Michel Barnier’s office.</p>

In order to tackle the challenges of the recession and slow economic growth, there is a need for more efficient tools and methods, new funding mechanisms and investment schemes.

      <p sl="pt">In a situation of incipient economic growth, market instability and increased global imbalances, the EU needs to strengthen its competitive advantages in order to attract investment, and thus promote balanced growth and greater cohesion. This report, for which I voted, calls on the Commission to draft a communication assessing and promoting the attractiveness of investing in Europe. This should include recommendations to the Member States and act as one of the bases for enhancing the EU investment environment. Despite being the world’s largest recipient of foreign direct investment, Europe needs to fix its weaknesses and make the most of its advantages and strengths, given increased competition from developing countries. Weak economic growth in Europe, high taxes and excessive public debt are factors which raise concerns among investors. However, the high quality and diversity of our human capital, the predictability of the business environment, and the high potential for research and innovation all work to our market’s advantage and are factors that should be strengthened and enhanced.</p>

      <p sl="it">Europe is considered to be the largest regional destination for foreign direct investment. A quarter of the world’s total consumption and investment takes place within its borders. However, the weak economic growth Europe has recorded in these last years and the high public debt accumulation in Member States raise concerns to investors, which have been magnified in the face of global competition, especially from the emerging economies. There are two distinct aspects to consider when it comes to the attractiveness of investing in Europe – on the one hand, there is the need to make Europe an attractive destination for foreign investors and, on the other, the need to make entrepreneurship attractive for the local entrepreneur. Reforms are needed to attract investment to Europe, at both national and European levels, aimed at improving the functioning of the single European market. I therefore agree with the rapporteur’s request to the Commission to draw up a communication to evaluate as well as promote the attractiveness of investing in Europe, including policy recommendations to Member States targeted at enhancing the investment environment in the Union. In my opinion, furthermore, we need to improve the regulatory framework further so as to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to compete fairly, so that we can make Europe an attractive place in which to invest and work and enhance its ability to create wealth and jobs.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the economic, financial and fiscal crisis in the European Union has significantly broadened economic and social disparities among Member States and regions, resulting in an uneven distribution of inward and outward investment across the European Union. The global economy has embarked on the road to recovery, but there is limited room for manoeuvre, and ensuring a steady economic recovery process requires policies at international, EU and national level to be cautious. The European Union suffers from weak growth and expected growth rates differ significantly across the European Union. This weak growth is due to continued uncertainty and a lack of consumer and market confidence. The financing of the Member States’ public debt has the effect of absorbing resources for investment, growth and employment, while capital flight from certain Member States to certain other Member States, as well as to certain third countries, may contribute to a worsening of the EU balance of payments situation. In order to tackle the fiscal crisis and enhance growth and employment, the Union should further exploit its strengths, such as the high level of consumption, education and quality of life, its research and innovation capacity, high labour efficiency and productivity, as well as a friendly and motivational business environment. It is therefore necessary to establish a consistent framework of stability within monetary, fiscal and trade policy, in order to facilitate the flow of direct investment in all Member States and EU regions, thereby contributing to correcting the European Union’s macro-economic imbalances.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The effects of the economic and financial crisis which has been plaguing the EU have contributed significantly to increasing economic and social disparities between Member States and regions, including a huge imbalance in the distribution of investment. Until recently, this area was dependent on bilateral treaties, with a large number of agreements, causing massive fragmentation and contributing to a lack of uniformity in the treatment of investors in the EU, and in their level of growth. As the Treaty of Lisbon has granted the EU exclusive competence in the field of foreign direct investment, it will be responsible for setting out an international investment policy that increases competitiveness and contributes to achieving the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A comprehensive common policy on investment should be developed that can provide investors with greater legal certainty and a predictable and stable framework that is fair and properly regulated.

Despite the crisis, the EU continues to be the world’s main beneficiary of investment. However, some companies are relocating their factories to countries with lower taxes, less bureaucracy and cheaper labour. It is therefore urgent to reverse this situation by reducing bureaucracy and cutting taxes for our entrepreneurs, in order to prevent the commercial centre of the world from moving from Europe to the Pacific. It is also vital to make our companies more competitive by investing in innovation and technological development.

Despite these facts, we do not make full use of the EU’s potential, and high taxes disincentivise investors, as does the huge public debt. Meanwhile, global competition from emerging economies is growing steadily. In this context, the single internal EU market is of particular importance. This is one of our most important priorities.

Increasing the level of investment and, in particular, of foreign direct investment, would stimulate the economies of the Member States and reduce the negative effects of fiscal consolidation. Therefore, I support initiatives involving continued funding of cohesion policy, because cohesion policy increases competitiveness and attracts investment to less-developed regions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Facilitating the access of small and medium-sized enterprises to finance is a key factor in increasing investment. This not only involves fighting the credit crunch, but also ensuring alternative ways for SMEs to raise capital, such as by accessing European venture capital funds. However, regulation of such funds should aim to impose requirements which would reduce investment risk.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Stimulating research and innovation is also extremely important for the growth of investment in this area in the EU, as it has particular potential, mainly because of its qualified workforce. However, the introduction of a single EU patent, although a good idea, may also have negative consequences.

The low level of economic growth and the high costs of labour are discouraging investment in this part of Europe. I think we need to react quickly to these worrying signs. We need to make the European market more attractive, because the regions have a great deal of untapped potential which is often not even noticed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Cohesion policy should be the key to solving macro-economic and regional problems, leading to higher competitiveness and economic growth in the regions and the creation of much-needed new jobs, in particular, for young people. I think the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report on the attractiveness of investing in Europe is a good one, so I voted in favour of its adoption.</p>

      <p sl="it">Europe needs to respond adequately to the challenges of stabilising the international economy in order to exploit global opportunities to the maximum. We must address our weaknesses and strengthen the advantages of all countries and regions to attract local and international investment that will contribute to our balanced growth and our cohesion. The Union is the world’s largest trading power and remains the largest regional destination for foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, we must be capable of exploiting our competitive advantages, given the rising competition from developing countries. This goal must be at the heart of the EU’s investment reforms and strategy, at both European and national levels. At the global level, the EU must continue its efforts to conclude bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements as well as participate actively in global economic governance. Attracting investment in Europe needs measures and reforms, at both European and national levels. Ensuring that businesses can compete openly and fairly is crucial with respect to making Europe an attractive place in which to invest and work. The single market is one of the most significant priorities in developing a friendly and motivational environment for businesses and consumers.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Structural problems, rising unemployment and uncertainty continue to have a negative impact on our ability to deal with global growth challenges. In order for Europe to become more attractive to investors, these deficiencies need to be addressed, and measures and reforms need to be implemented both at European and at national level. Due to uncertainty, banks are experiencing financing difficulties, and resolute measures are therefore needed to enhance the financial markets. I agree that the European Union economy needs a financial sector that supports real economies, ensures stability, and is able to serve the needs of households and enterprises. SMEs are facing increasing difficulties in obtaining financing, and Member States should therefore implement regulatory measures that facilitate SME financing, seeing as how SMEs often act as drivers of local growth. The appropriate financing of cohesion policy is also important because it contributes to emphasising the benefits and innovation potential of regions and to highlighting their importance to growth, investment and employment. By promoting cultural industries, sport and tourism, which represent growing and attractive markets, we should also exploit the potential that lies in our historic heritage. I agree with the rapporteur, and therefore voted in favour of the report. Investments must be aimed at addressing the specific needs of the various regions and Member States while appropriately involving local communities.</p>

The underdeveloped regions are benefiting from substantial European funding to attract potential investors and will continue to benefit from them. Solidarity, however, requires growth. The social acquis are the result of a high-performance economy. Social protection can only ever be the consequence of work and responsibility. We must make investment the central component of our European policies. We need an economic government that implements proactive policies to produce promising investments. We must complete the single market, the key driver of economic growth, by fully implementing the legislation on energy and services. We need the courage to restructure certain sectors. We must press for a more flexible mobilisation of the Structural Funds, promote the entrepreneurial spirit and provide access to funding.

      <p sl="sk">The ongoing crisis highlights the urgent need to mobilise the Union’s policy to fully support growth and increase funding for the EU economy through investment. This, of course, is not achievable without the effective implementation of structural reforms in order to improve the business climate and create jobs in all regions of the EU. With its 500 million consumers, the European single market offers huge advantages for investors, and the EU therefore traditionally maintains a high potential to attract foreign direct investment. The European Union must know how to properly utilise the huge potential of the world’s largest single market when seeking a comprehensive solution for the debt crisis suffered by citizens and businesses. I believe, therefore, that in addition to making Europe an attractive destination for foreign investors, we must first create favourable business conditions for local entrepreneurs, who still face many obstacles in the internal market. Inward investment in the European Union should help not only to make the environment for foreign direct investment more attractive, but also help overall investment and business in the internal market by improving sustainable infrastructure for business, education, research and development. For these reasons, I support the report on the attractiveness of investing in Europe.</p>

Furthermore, American rating agencies are making decisions about the creditworthiness of European countries, which can, in turn, lead to difficulties with investment and finance. As long as countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal are continuing to cause monetary instability in the euro area, it is likely to be difficult to prevent economic and social inequalities between the countries in the area, which is what the rapporteur is calling for.

Taxation policy remains a matter for Member States and, in any case, there are many more pressing priorities if we are to attract new investment. Most important is the need to complete the single market. More than twenty years after its creation, the single market – particularly in the services sector – is fragmented and differs from country to country. As a result of this, there are a number of Member States where it is very hard to start a business. Without a level playing field for businesses to operate in, we will continue to lose billions of euro of potential business activity. We need to make it easier for companies to do business in Europe and to make payments easier and faster, through closer cooperation in implementing rules on VAT and avoiding double taxation and by reducing the bureaucratic burden, particularly on small businesses.

      <p sl="en">Investment in Europe and, in particular, foreign direct investment, is hugely important to Europe’s economy. This report, which I voted in favour of, calls on the Commission to present a strategy to make investment in Europe more attractive. Cohesion policy investment is vital to this, as is creating a more robust European industrial policy. I fully support the report’s call for the greater use of innovative financial instruments and its emphasis on the need to facilitate workers’ and citizens’ mobility, which is vital to ensuring further investment in jobs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Regarding corporate taxation, I, too, think that a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base will contribute to addressing some serious fiscal obstacles to growth in the single market which create disincentives for investment in the EU.

      <p sl="el">The report lays out the entire imperialist EU strategy east of the border with the Eastern partnership, through the trade links developed by the EU within that framework. The flagship proposal in the report is the establishment and development between the EU and every other country of a so-called ‘Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area’ (DCFTA) and ‘investment protection’, which really means the penetration of the euro-unifying monopolies throughout the Eastern partnership. It puts pressure on all the Eastern partners to join the WTO. It calls on the EU to step up efforts to enter into free trade agreements (FTAs), in a bid to neutralise Russian influence on these countries, thereby expressing the stiff competition between euro-unifying and Russian monopolies trying to gain a foothold on the emerging markets in the area. It openly proclaims that the EU must use these FTAs to intervene in these countries, including politically, on the pretext of democracy and human rights. It is especially insulting of Belarus, which it calls upon to join the WTO. It supports restrictive measures by the EU against that country and calls on the EU to step up aid to various NGOs and ‘civil society’, in the aim of imposing the political regime of its choice, so as to ‘eliminate obstacles to business’.</p>

I supported the recommendations for each country, which differ in accordance with the democratic progress and respect for the principles of the rule of law in each.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report on the implementation of association agreements with the Eastern partnership’s trading partners in order to establish a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. As China’s impact on European trade is growing and Russia continues to engage in protectionist policies, the EU’s European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern partners is one of the Union’s priority aims. I believe that the prospect of creating Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) with the EU is one of the greatest ambitions of EU bilateral trade policy for fighting tendencies towards protectionism at global level. The development of Eastern partnership trade is essential for avoiding regional conflicts in future, which lead to economic isolation. The development of trade relations with the Eastern partners is therefore important not just economically; its impact covers issues relating to the development of democracy, the rule of law and common EU principles. I believe that in the long term, the benefits of integration should compensate the Eastern partners for the efforts they have made.</p>

From the socio-political point of view, this area is still unstable, but the EU cannot avoid introducing partnership policies with it.

Only four out of the six countries of the Eastern partnership are already members of the WTO, with the governments of Azerbaijan and Belarus having only observer status. However, all EU Eastern partners, being the ex-USSR states, share the same historical and institutional background. They have also faced similar challenges in their political and socio-economic transition over the past two decades. Furthermore, following the revolutionary events which took place in 2011 in the European Union’s Southern neighbourhood, EU interest has been focused on the southern neighbours and the countries belonging to the Eastern partnership and EU trade relations with them deserve the attention of the EU. Prosperity and stability in the EU’s eastern neighbourhood are in the EU’s utmost interest. As stable and predictable relations between the EU and its Eastern partners develop, trade volumes will undoubtedly increase in both directions.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on the trade aspects of the Eastern partnership, which follows on from the joint communication from the European institutions on ‘a new response to a changing neighbourhood’. The Eastern partnership consists of the European Union, on the one hand and, on the other, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. As the EU is the main export market and the main source of imports for these countries, it was important to introduce new trade agreements suited to changing economic needs and capacities. Moreover, these agreements are in line with the idea of the ‘more for more’ principle. This concept creates a link between political progress on the road to wide-ranging democratisation and the economic liberalisation of trade. This report also stresses the need for regulatory convergence, with the aim of achieving gradual economic integration with the EU’s single market. This report, therefore, sends a strong political and economic signal to the countries in the Eastern partnership and stresses our commitment to them.</p>

Nonetheless, the truth is that conflicts between these sorts of partners tend to be fewer and the partners often aim to exhaust means of dialogue before resorting to war. Following years of tension on their eastern borders due to the Cold War and the Sovietisation of the region, it is reassuring to note that, despite the differences and disparities between the EU and its Eastern partners, there is a willingness today to prioritise trade issues and to seek an increasingly close relationship which is productive for all parties. It will not do to ignore the fact that there is still a long way to go, in particular, with regard to issues of democracy, human rights and combating corruption and violence, but it is right to acknowledge the work that has been done and some successes that have been achieved.

      <p sl="pt">Mr Ransdorf’s report aims to promote and strengthen trade relations in the EU’s Eastern partnership. Over recent decades, the EU has favoured trade relations with eastern countries while encouraging democratisation and seeking to implement respect for fundamental human rights. This is an important partnership for these countries, but it is also vital for the EU in overcoming certain problems that the eastern Member States are facing. It is vital to resolve the problem of the pipeline with Moldova, open energy corridors and overcome visa-related issues with Ukraine. In relation to Georgia, although the President’s democratic ideals are well known, it is necessary to press ahead with the social reforms under way in order to end the scourge that is child labour. I welcome the establishment of this new Eastern partnership, with an agreement that covers not only trade in goods but also other areas such as increased solidarity and non-tariff barriers, as the EU should continue to support these peoples in order to ensure close integration which is always based on full respect for the rule of law and democracy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The majority in Parliament is going full steam ahead along a course that has been shown, in the reality of the EU as the largest free trade area in the world, to make no contribution towards resolving any of the problems that the workers and peoples are facing. The insistence on the free movement of goods and capital between the EU and these countries, and the ‘integration’ of the markets of the Eastern partnership countries advocated here, through the creation of ‘Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas’, only benefits the companies with a dominant position in production and marketing. The consequences of this are well known due to what has happened in Portugal: the destruction of small and medium-sized enterprises and national production, creating even more unemployment, and the destruction of workers’ rights. Moreover, as the situation of the EU demonstrates, ‘free trade’ has impacts that go far beyond purely trade issues, also influencing the state of democracy, and we believe that this is for the worse. ‘Free trade’ encourages the concentration and centralisation of the wealth of economically richer countries and their companies, and it runs counter to the development of fairer trade relations based on sovereignty, protection and increased national production, which can only be safeguarded by trade relations based on complementarity between countries.</p>

Four out of the six countries of the EU’s Eastern partnership are already members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the remaining two countries have observer status. The primary aim in this respect of the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy is the conclusion and implementation of agreements involving the issue of free trade – DCFTA agreements. These are of the utmost importance in the EU’s bilateral trade policy and in line with our efforts to achieve a stable, transparent and predictable economic environment. They are also fundamental in the fight against protectionism at a global level. They also reach far beyond trade issues and influence the state of democracy and the rule of law. I believe it is important to focus on the gradual dismantling of trade barriers, the strengthening of investment protection, the streamlining of customs and border procedures and the restriction of technical barriers to trade.

The report also notes that national parliaments have an important role to play as well in harmonising trade legislation with the EU acquis , which is a prerequisite for concluding and implementing future agreements properly. There are countries in the Eastern partnership which have made remarkable progress, such as the Republic of Moldova. The report recognises with satisfaction that Moldova, despite the fragility of its economy, has, in recent years, undergone a remarkable reform process and hugely improved its economic performance.

In recent years, Moldova has been through an exceptional series of reforms and has taken far-reaching steps towards European integration. I would also like to mention Georgia, one of the fastest-reforming economies in the world. Georgia is in a very specific situation as regards DCFTA negotiations and certain requirements and regulations laid down by the Commission. The Georgians have – in many cases quite rightly – closed down many bodies which had responsibility for oversight and inspection, as these were perceived as remnants of the Soviet system. This means that what the EU says are institutions which monitor standards often seem to the Georgians to be the corrupt legacy of Communism. The EU is Belarus’s second largest trading partner after Russia. It is true that our eastern neighbour has undoubted potential. I am certain that Belarusian citizens deserve to belong to the European family of democratic and free market states. Unfortunately, Minsk is moving ever further away from the EU in terms of political and economic standards. Furthermore, the Belarusian economic model, in which 80% of enterprises are owned by the state, leaves a great deal to be desired. So, when we are talking about Belarus and the commercial aspect of the Eastern partnership, a DCFTA, unfortunately, has to be put off to another day.</p>

It is clear that through the creation of free trade areas, we want to act not only at the economic level but also at the political and social levels of the countries involved in the trade partnership.

People who can trade more freely will discover on their own the advantages of a political system based on respect for the rule of law and democratic values. I also welcome the Commission’s proposal to increase by 40% the funding available for the eastern neighbourhood policy in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2021. We need to spend European taxpayers’ money in an effective way and reward high achievers. The Republic of Moldova has made considerable progress in the past year. This would not have been possible without the EU’s support. We need to continue our negotiations with the Eastern partners and open up new economic possibilities for their citizens. Financial support, free trade and strong conditionality are the tools the Union should use in promoting our values in the neighbourhood.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this resolution, which ‘is convinced that the economic integration of the Eastern partners with the EU cannot be efficiently carried out without political and social reforms, participation of civil society in the decision-making process and economic integration among the Eastern partners themselves; emphasises that economic integration among these countries should be open, so as to capitalise on its benefits; regrets in this regard that regional frozen conflicts have, for many years, harmed the effectiveness and development of cross-border trade and continue to cause enormous economic losses to some of the Eastern partners and to lead to their economic isolation’.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to welcome the fact that this report has directed the European Parliament’s attention in relation to the Eastern partnership programme towards the practical side of our mutual relations in the area of the economy and trade. Even though the original version opened up and exacerbated the difference in ideological approaches less, the final version of the report is a good step towards improving our relations. Unfortunately, it completely failed to avoid formulations that amount to double standards when it comes to assessing Eastern partnership countries. It is important that the WTO accession talks are emphasised. In my opinion, however, it is more important to be able to make use of the benefits arising from cooperation with Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan, which have created a functional customs union. Turning our backs on this partnership would mean significant losses for the EU in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">By adopting this report, we wish to emphasise the importance of the comprehensive institution building programme, technical assistance and information exchange instrument (TAIEX) with our Eastern partners. In the long run, the benefits of such integration will compensate for the initial efforts: the support and involvement of local civil society and international NGOs in promoting the long-term benefits is key for the success of their reform processes.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are in favour of strengthening cooperation between the EU and its Eastern partners in a number of sectors, in particular, industry, small and medium-sized enterprises, research, development and innovation, and tourism. The economic integration of the Eastern partners with the EU cannot be efficiently carried out without political and social reforms, participation of civil society in the decision-making process and economic integration among the Eastern partners themselves.</p>

The report also stresses that Russia has undermined trade negotiations between the EU and several Eastern partners, and that this will be counterproductive in the long run for these countries. I agree with this view. In my opinion, we should make good use of the fact that the Union is the main export partner of the Eastern partnership countries. It should, however, be said that effective economic integration of the Eastern partners with the EU is not possible without political and social reforms or without the participation of civil society in the decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Trade is a very important component of the EU’s relations with the Eastern partnership countries.

From an historic perspective, we have stronger links with the eastern countries and they are generally closer to us in cultural terms. In the light of China’s constantly growing economic influence in the countries of the Eastern partnership, I doubt whether concluding and implementing the association agreement, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs), should be a high priority and an important requirement for the revised European Neighbourhood Policy with regard to our Eastern partners. We should not forget Russia’s historic sphere of influence in this respect. An approach of this kind could rapidly become an own goal with regard to our ongoing energy dependency.

With this document, the European Parliament has again expressed its support for the European aspirations and reforms of the countries of the Eastern partnership (EaP). The EU is not only aiming to establish an area of close political cooperation but a stable, transparent and predictable area of economic cooperation. Mutual efforts are required to establish such a trade area and I am therefore pleased that in many respects, things are moving forward as regards the conclusion of DCFTA agreements. Trade policy is one of the most effective instruments for promoting reforms. It is not an aid instrument and it is therefore very important for EaP countries to continue to make every effort to facilitate the conclusion of such agreements. On the other hand, tendencies contrary to the EU’s goals are being observed in this region. It is regrettable that to some, it still seems that an area of stability, transparency, sustainable development and democracy goes against someone’s interests.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the report, particularly because it contains a number of vitally important references to trade relations with the Eastern states in the agricultural sector. One of these references relates to the process of implementing the EU’s sanitary and plant protection measures which would guarantee partner states the opportunity to export agricultural products to the EU without disadvantaging European farmers. This is the only way to allow the trade relationship in the agricultural sector between the EU and third countries to operate, if the same rules apply to everyone.</p>

The gradual removal of trade barriers will increase economic integration and help to harmonise the legal framework in areas that influence trade in goods and services. Economic integration between the European Union and the countries of the Eastern partnership will also provide a significant stimulus to the implementation of democratic reforms in those countries. For Europe, cooperation with the countries of the Eastern partnership is of great economic and political importance.</p>

Trade in goods and services is a powerful tool for stimulating economic growth, increasing competitiveness and supporting economic recovery, while also influencing the state of democracy and strengthening the rule of law. In this context, the conclusion and implementation of association agreements, including Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs), are a priority objective and aim of the European Neighbourhood Policy with regard to its Eastern partners. However, the success of the DCFTAs will depend largely on the institutional strengthening and proper implementation of commitments, which can only be ensured in an environment of open, transparent and corruption-free negotiation.

The gradual dismantling of trade barriers and regulatory convergence in areas that have an impact on trade are rightly included in this Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Beyond the economic aspect, free trade areas can be a core component of a wider political agreement, leading, in particular, to an association agreement. The rapporteur also stresses that, with the signature of agreements and the creation of the free trade area, the European Union might also provide its assistance and strengthen the role of civil society or even steer reforms, both in the public and private sectors.

I welcome the efforts made towards strengthening the Eastern partnership, especially the Commission’s initiatives on SMEs, including the facility granted to SMEs based on the Eastern partnership. I think that the main benefits which the EU will gain from implementing the DCFTA will be more stable and predictable trade. For example, Ukraine is the EU’s largest Eastern partner and the DCFTA opens up a new market of 46 million consumers for the EU. I should stress the importance of Moldova continuing to align with the EU its energy infrastructure and systems for technical regulation, standardisation, conformity assessment, testing and market surveillance. I welcome the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, proposing a 40% rise in the funding available to the European neighbourhood policy.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today, my strong recommendation to this House is that we reject the ACTA Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the outset of this debate though, let me make it clear that, unlike some, I do not criticise the Commission for bringing forward this proposal. It is their role as the institution with the right of initiative to do so. But the role of Parliament has been strengthened under the Lisbon Treaty and it is our job to scrutinise international agreements and to give them or deny them our consent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last three or four months, I have carefully studied the text. I have spoken to the officials who have negotiated this agreement. I have spoken to the rights holders that it seeks to protect, and I have engaged with civil society organisations who have serious concerns about this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally have come to the conclusion that there are serious flaws and serious concerns about the way that this agreement could be misinterpreted and implemented. Therefore, as rapporteur, I cannot recommend that the Parliament gives it its approval.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before, I have described myself as the accidental rapporteur. I genuinely came to this report with no agenda on ACTA and, if anything, I was probably regarded as having a pro-IPR agenda. I know of authors and musicians who are far from wealthy and who depend on the protection of their creations to make a living.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said before, creativity is the raw material of the European Union. In September 2011, we were here debating the EU 2020 strategy and the future of trade policy. Protecting European intellectual property is a key part of that. We cannot compete globally as a low-wage economy and we should not try. Protecting our innovation and creative industries is vital for job creation and for economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this is not a vote about the general importance of IPR. It is a vote on the text of the ACTA Treaty. I have listened to civil society’s concerns on this agreement and, while some of the perceived threats of ACTA were perhaps exaggerated or unfounded, I am convinced that there are some key problems with the treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first is a lack of clear definition of ‘commercial scale’. ACTA refers to ‘commercial activities for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage’. But what exactly is ‘indirect commercial advantage’. What if one person copies a piece of music or a film and gives it to a friend, who gives it to another friend, and so on. Is that ‘commercial scale’, or is that simple private usage? I know the Commission will say that it is not ‘commercial scale’ because commercial scale is defined in European law. But ‘commercial scale’ is not defined in the ACTA Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also possible that ACTA could unintentionally criminalise individuals if we do not have a clear and precise definition of ‘commercial scale’. I also have related concerns to the sanctions contained in the ACTA Treaty which appear sometimes to be excessive in terms of the civil and criminal penalties.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third major area of concern I have is the role of Internet service providers (ISPs). Provisions which might push ISPs to monitor online behaviour and report individuals for IPR infringement is very dangerous. It is not the role of ISPs to police the Internet, and we should not be privatising law enforcement in this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have had many debates in this Chamber on international agreements. I have often said that the devil is in the detail. This time, the devil is in the lack of detail. Rights holders in the creative and manufacturing industries are voracious in pursuing their rights, often understandably so when you see the level of counterfeit and piracy they face.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this means that a vague text is dangerous. We cannot guarantee that civil liberties will be robustly protected by the ACTA Treaty provisions. When it comes down to protecting intellectual property rights or protecting civil liberties, civil liberties should always be central to the concern of this House. The freedom of the Internet is highly valued by our citizens and we interfere with that at our peril.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, tomorrow, you will have to make a choice. It is an important choice for at least two reasons. Firstly, because the debate over the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement has involved much discussion of its relationship with the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens. Secondly, because of the signal this vote will send to our trading partners and to the more than 120 million workers that work in Europe’s innovative, manufacturing and creative sectors. They are dependent for their livelihoods on the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights, in Europe and across the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has asked the European Court of Justice for its opinion on whether the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is compatible with the treaties and, in particular, with our Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have done this because these questions are crucial for those who took to the streets over ACTA earlier this year. We share their view that these concerns must be addressed. That is why the ACTA agreement should be the subject of the most careful scrutiny and deliberation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect, I believe that it would have been preferable for Parliament to wait until we know what the Court thinks before voting. But that is not where we are today. Tomorrow, you will only be able to choose to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the agreement. Let me then just say that my considered view, as a lifelong supporter of human rights and fundamental freedoms, is that there is nothing to fear in this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">ACTA is not an attack on our liberties, it is a defence of our livelihoods. This is because we do not have to modify any part of our internal legislation, the so-called acquis communautaire . What is legal today in the European Union will remain legal once ACTA is ratified. And what is illegal today will still remain illegal with ACTA. Nothing changes in the eyes of the law. And since our freedoms are not threatened by our current laws, our freedoms will not be threatened by ACTA. This is also – I might add – the view of the European Parliament’s own Legal Service. I hope that you will bear these considerations in mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">Economic consequences are the second reason the vote is important. We all agree that counterfeiting and piracy are a serious problem. They risk undermining one of Europe’s most significant competitive advantages over other regions of the world, namely, our knowledge-based and creative industries. ACTA is designed to extend the tools for enforcement of intellectual property rights that have been so successful in Europe – and which this Parliament has always supported – to other countries as well. No more. No less.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, as you come to make your choice about how to vote tomorrow, you should also make no mistake: a vote against ACTA will be a setback for the protection of our intellectual property rights around the world. Neither are there any quick fixes for its rejection. Those who think that we can come back any time soon with a revised agreement or with a new treaty have been misled. What is true is that, if Parliament votes this treaty down, the Commission will continue to wait for the opinion of the Court and study it closely. Why? Because citizens have raised concerns over its potential impact on fundamental rights, because many of you have raised similar questions – so let us get some answers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I consider it my obligation, my responsibility as European Commissioner – indeed the responsibility of us all – to ask for clarity from Europe’s highest court. Furthermore, we will also look at how the debate on intellectual property rights evolves over the coming months. There are legitimate issues to be discussed and clarified about some rules on intellectual property rights in the digital environment. For instance, the definition of ‘commercial scale’ and what sharing information means in relation to the challenges one faces with respect to the protection of intellectual property.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that these discussions will be able to happen in their proper context – which is in debates about the substantive law of the European Union, not about international enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Besides the European Parliament, the Commission would also discuss the outcome of the Court referral with other signatories of ACTA and would then consider further steps to take.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Europeans, I believe that we all share profound respect for individual freedom. But I also know that freedom needs a framework. What we are doing both with ACTA and with European legislation is making sure that the framework strikes the right balance. It is a delicate task and we must proceed carefully.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I find myself in a peculiar situation as rapporteur for the Committee on Development because the committee has adopted an opposite opinion to the one I proposed as rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Committee favoured a negative position on this agreement. I, as rapporteur, was more favourable towards it, but I have to respect the majority opinion, of course.</p>
      <p sl="cs">However, I must add a few comments on this. In my opinion, there is a clear majority in this Parliament that simply wants to reject this agreement, and for a variety of reasons. I have to say it is rather illogical that Parliament has decided not to wait for the opinion of the European Court of Justice on the compatibility of this agreement with European primary law. I frankly do not understand this, and I would consider it far more logical to wait.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I take things as they are, however, and since the Committee on Development has adopted a negative opinion, I have no option as rapporteur but to reproduce that opinion here.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I would like to say thank you to all my fellow Members and everyone listening out there in Europe. For those of us who have been involved in the information policy debate for a long time, the decision that this House will take tomorrow is not only symbolic of what is right and proper in the information age, it is also crucial for European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Communication and culture build societies. It is no surprise, therefore, that ACTA was the issue that generated the pan-European debate that caught our attention and that caused many people to consider how we as a society actually want to deal with communication.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It was on this very issue that I and many others in my political party, the Pirate Party, found a reason for our involvement in politics. The problem is that the agreement does not change anything. We need more access to culture and communication. How do we actually want to relate to other people? How do we build a sense of community and familiarity with other people?</p>
      <p sl="sv">All of us who consider these questions and who are helping to build these communities hope that Parliament will be strong when it takes the decision tomorrow – we hope that Parliament will listen to all of Europe’s citizens when they speak with one voice because our societies need to be founded on the values of the citizens. It is clear that citizens’ values involve making communication and cultural exchange a priority and an opportunity for the future, and that is something that I and my political group here in Parliament, together with many other colleagues from other political groups, will recognise in the votes tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr De Gucht, first of all, the purpose of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a good one and involves establishing international standards to combat breaches of copyright and product piracy. However, ACTA is a prime example of how we should not be dealing with the justified concerns of citizens, in other words, with a lack of transparency that has to be seen to be believed.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are many serious reservations about ACTA. The Committee on Legal Affairs has taken these reservations into account and has made clear its opposition to ACTA. The intention of the agreement is to intervene in data protection and, therefore, in the right to informational self-determination. The agreement is too vague and, as a result, I am concerned that it may be implemented differently in the relevant states, which will be to the detriment of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am opposed to Internet service providers being able to monitor citizens and, under certain circumstances, actually doing so. I am concerned that the necessary renewal of copyright in Europe will be restricted and forestalled under pressure from the industry. This is why we must say a clear ‘No’ to ACTA tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we acknowledge and respect fully the need for artists to be protected and to be compensated for their genius and the challenges posed by current technology when it comes to achieving this. However, we must not accept and cannot allow basic fundamental rights in Europe and the rest of the world to be eroded. The European Union – and I must emphasise this – has established very high levels of protection for fundamental rights and the European Parliament must be in the front line of efforts to maintain those high levels, for the benefit, as always, of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is precisely within this spirit that we arrived in our opinion at the conclusion that ACTA is not compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, especially in light of its ambiguity. We therefore recommend that the House reject this ambiguous agreement.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I would like to underline this: rejection of ACTA should not mark the end of the affair. It should mark the beginning of proper public debate involving all interested parties, in order to arrive at a modern social agreement and regime for protecting intellectual property rights.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, tomorrow we will vote on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and I would like to start by making it clear what I and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) think about this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need international cooperation in order to defend intellectual property rights, to put a stop to counterfeit medicines and vehicle parts, to stop violations of European patents and piracy of European products and to safeguard Europe’s competitiveness. ACTA is a good basis for this work.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It would, however, be irresponsible to vote on ACTA tomorrow – to take a position before we have all of the cards on the table and before the European Court of Justice has issued its opinion on the agreement. This is not a reasonable and responsible way to deal with this issue. I would like to ask all those who are opposed to waiting for the Court of Justice just one thing: why? What is it that you are so afraid the Court of Justice will say that you feel it is necessary, at all costs, to vote before the EU’s highest judicial body has expressed its opinion?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Tomorrow’s vote is not just about ACTA. It is about patient safety, research, air safety, competitiveness, the environment, job security, etc., as these areas are all affected by piracy, patent violations and counterfeiting.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Therefore, voting ‘no’ tomorrow carries a great deal of responsibility. It may perhaps resolve the conflict regarding ACTA, but it will not represent a solution to the problems and challenges that Europe is facing. Voting ‘no’ will not maintain the status quo either. It will weaken Europe’s voice on the world stage. How are we to be able to convince India to take forceful action against counterfeit medicines if we ourselves have rejected European or international cooperation based on our own legislation?</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is no surprise to me that those in this House who do not want intellectual property rights or who do not believe we should protect intellectual property rights will vote against ACTA before we have the Court’s opinion, in the same way as it is no surprise that someone who does not want Europe to fight against climate change does not want the Kyoto Protocol either. However, I do not believe that reflects the opinion of the majority of us in this House, and therefore I hope you will not want to put an end to ACTA before we have all the cards on the table. Why is that? Well, we need international cooperation on intellectual property rights in order to protect European jobs, consumers, patients, etc. That is why we should not discard ACTA tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, this is a political issue on which we have to decide. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have analysed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) very closely and carefully, and we would like to make it clear that ACTA is not a suitable instrument for guaranteeing copyright protection and preventing counterfeiting. ACTA is the wrong instrument for this and, therefore, we in the S&amp;D Group will be voting against it. Why is that? For three reasons.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the countries which are mainly responsible for counterfeiting and disregarding copyright are not the subject of the agreement. The good have been sorted out from the bad and, in international terms, it makes absolutely no sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, rules from the analogue area of counterfeiting have been transferred into the digital world and, as a result, the wrong rules are being imposed on consumers who behave differently in a digital environment. This is why we are saying that we cannot put apples and pears into a saucepan and finish up with apple sauce. The wrong things are being combined here and that is the second reason why we are opposed to ACTA.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, ladies and gentlemen, the most important reason is the third one. ACTA is putting the digital world into a straitjacket and we do not even know whether we want it, because the question of enforcing intellectual property rights on the Internet, in the digital environment, has not even been resolved within the European Union. The Commission’s presentation of its legislative proposal is overdue. How can we conclude an international agreement in this area if we have not even discussed the legislative proposal within the European Union and drafted some sensible legislation? Therefore, let us put ACTA to one side and, first of all, draw up a sensible European law. I call on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – You are mixing up apples and pears again. Climate policy is obviously something quite different from the question of copyright protection. You know very well that 60% of all counterfeit products come from China and this is why it is genuinely necessary for the international community to enter into a dialogue with China in order to find a solution and not simply to sort out the good countries from the bad ones, Mr Fjellner.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in November 2010, many of us asked the Commission to wait before signing the agreement and present an impact assessment first. The Commission decided to go ahead and sign straight away, assuring us that everything was fine, only to subsequently turn to the Court of Justice and receive a worrying warning from the EU privacy supervisor.</p>
      <p sl="it">Meanwhile, citizens in the EU mobilised in an unprecedented way, with 2.8 million signatures, whilst many entrepreneurs have reacted cautiously with regard to the future of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), precisely because they believe that existing laws can protect them just as effectively.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that there are two lessons in this, and I hope that the Commission will learn from them with regard to the next measures announced by the Commissioner. The first lesson is that the Web is now considered by European citizens to be a real common good, like biodiversity or water. It is considered a space for individual freedom that must not be threatened by any kind of measure. In Washington, Senator Wyden, Chair of the Subcommittee on International Trade, whom I visited last February, told us that with ACTA, experiences such as Wikipedia might have not come into being. I do not know if this statement corresponds to the truth, but we must also adopt the precautionary principle.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, we cannot implement important measures without the citizens’ approval, and there is a need for debate, which so far has been clearly insufficient. I think this should be understood and, if we do not understand it, I believe we will not go very far in today’s Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">I became familiar with ACTA just after I was elected. I have followed this agreement as shadow rapporteur in a thousand debates in committee, in plenary, – and I have to say the Commission has always shown a very loyal and cooperative attitude – in interviews and in debates with civil society. I do not know if this will be the last debate. I must say that we will certainly be ready for further discussion and, Commissioner, I really do not hope that we will be able to say ‘acta est fabula’ , the play is over. This is in the public interest, in the interest of freedom of expression and, I must say, in the interest of the European institutions’ image as well.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that when we vote against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) tomorrow, we can have an open and transparent debate about how intellectual property and intellectual property rights should be enforced, wherever this occurs, be it in the analogue or the digital world. It is good that we have finally clarified the fact that ACTA will not be implemented politically as it currently stands and that ACTA and enforcement within a coalition of the willing consisting of just a few industrial countries would be the wrong route to take. I believe it is also right for you, Mr De Gucht, to admit this and to respect fully Parliament’s opinion that this is unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr Caspary, thank you very much for your explanations. Of course I am of the opinion that there are indeed ways of guaranteeing that intellectual property rights are enforced on an international level. I believe that it is very important to understand why the developing and emerging economies have been refusing to cooperate with us for such a long time in the international organisations, including the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), and perhaps to consider exceptions for generics and technology transfer, because coming to an agreement on international regulations is not a one-sided process.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the significant problem here is that a whole raft of other matters, including the enforcement of copyright and the Internet, have been added to the original issue of combating counterfeiting and piracy. As Mr Lange has also said, these additional matters have nothing to do with this issue and they can be implemented jointly by the international community.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think it is quite clear from the level of the debate that we have all received a lot of correspondence from a number of constituents. Yet most of my correspondence has come from non-constituents from all round the world warning me of gloom and doom if ACTA were to be passed, and of the end of the Internet. Frankly, that is a load of rubbish and we should really focus on some of the concerns that we all had at the beginning.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were concerns right across the House on transparency; there were concerns on the issue of fundamental rights and civil rights for citizens and I think some of those issues would have been dealt with by the European Court of Justice. I think we also have to be quite clear that many of the laws about the Internet which are worrying us actually come from national governments. The ‘three strikes and you are out’, for example, and some of the American proposals on the Internet have nothing to do with ACTA.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are national governments that have brought in these measures but I think there is also an important distinction to be made. In his book ‘Free’, Chris Anderson, the editor of ‘Wired’, makes a distinction between the world of atoms and the world of bits. He says that in a world of increased processing power, increased bandwidth and increased storage, the price of digital products tends towards zero and therefore he proposes new business models for digital products.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem with that view is that people should be allowed to give away and share if they want but, at the same time, we should not prevent those who want to use intellectual property and make money out of intellectual property from being allowed to do so. We should allow both business models to be able to coexist.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, my real concern about this is that many political groups wanted a referral to the ECJ. We pushed the Commission for a referral to the ECJ but, when the Commission actually goes ahead and listens to us and refers to the ECJ, what do we do? We move the goal posts and we complain about a referral to the ECJ and we ask for rejection. I actually think that is quite dishonourable and we will not be taken seriously if we continue to act in this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to say, as someone who is concerned about European integration, that in some way, I welcome the undermining of the ECJ in this way because the ECJ has been one of the greatest pushers for European integration. If you are going to set that precedent, I thank you, but let us focus on the issue at hand. Let us not move the goal posts when we have asked for a referral in the first place. The most honourable thing to have done would have been to wait for the referral to the ECJ and wait for the ECJ to rule. In fact, the ECJ’s ruling may even have given you ammunition against those who are against ACTA. I welcome any blue cards at this stage. Bring it on.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe have been discussing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) for months, as we also have here in this House. They came to the conclusion that they do not want or need ACTA. They are concerned that ACTA represents a threat to their freedom in the digital world. They are also worried about issues of central data protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have learnt during the course of this debate that the Internet has brought a new dimension to democracy and to our lives. It has become an important aspect of the way in which democracy in the European Union functions, particularly over recent weeks and months. The citizens are pinning all their hopes on the European Parliament and relying on it to defend their interests against the Commission, which has negotiated this agreement, Mr De Gucht, with a mandate from the Council over a period of six years. Two years ago, we insisted that more transparency was needed and we succeeded in bringing the secret ACTA negotiations into the light of day. Now we must not postpone this debate. We must come to a decision. We do not need to wait for the Court of Justice of the European Union, because this concerns the content of the agreement, as other Members have already said. We must decide now.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, this is about a quite different dimension. We must all work together to bring about change. We live in an age when the ways in which information and knowledge are used are becoming increasingly separated from the concept of private property. We need to develop new structures that will equate to a new legal culture concerning the access to and use of content. Children must acquire an understanding of this area in school. This is the content of the debate about ACTA and it also applies to the debate about the future development of patents, copyright, international trade and economic cooperation in a multilateral and networked world. We also need to discuss this on a multilateral basis with China, Brazil and many other countries within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and to come to an agreement about it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr De Gucht, I believe that you are not certain about or fully aware of the revolutionary impact of the Internet. In the case of ACTA, you are continuing to defend a business model from a period in the past when most people still went to a shop to buy records. At that time, it was mainly big non-European companies such as Sony that were making large amounts of money and they treated their artists as if they owned them. Anyone who defends this sort of monopoly is failing to support the interests of the artists. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be a good moment for democracy and for the importance of the European Parliament and that it will allow us to put an end to ACTA.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, few debates or discussions have generated as much emotion and interest among public opinion as the controversy over the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. As we all know, this matter has caused not just debate and discussion, but also mass street protests in many of the countries of Europe and other parts of the world. It was conspicuous that the protesters were mainly young people, people who are particularly sensitive to the vulnerability of fundamental rights, including the rights to information, liberty and privacy. The sense of being under threat and the feelings which emerged when this document was being considered were also influenced by the difficult situation in which the younger generation finds itself, and by the social context, mass unemployment and low pay. The history we are witnessing has also revealed the citizens’ overwhelming lack of trust in the democratically elected authorities of particular countries and of the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The greatest outrage has been caused not just by the content of the agreement itself, but also by the way it was introduced and the circumstances under which this was done, including the lack of real public consultations. This caused understandable suspicion and anger, particularly among young people. We should learn the right lessons from this bitter experience, and should look again at the serious and real problem of protecting intellectual property rights – a problem which none of us treats lightly. The paradox here is that the way forward and the way to change and correct this situation is to reject the document at tomorrow’s vote.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, for once, I was pleasantly surprised that Parliament’s Committee on International Trade (INTA) took a position on 21 June against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which will be put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In keeping with my opposition in France to the bureaucratic censorship authority, Hadopi, which is a sort of French version of ACTA and which has already shown real shortcomings – particularly technical shortcomings – in its fight against piracy of protected works, I will vote for this recommendation, which aims to put an end to this umpteenth freedom destroying project, this time on an international scale, for ACTA is most definitely a freedom destroying, internationalist project. Under the guise of wanting to combat counterfeiting, ACTA’s repressive logic with regard to individuals would surely lead to Internet censorship while threatening access to culture for the weakest of our fellow citizens to the sole benefit of large private groups.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, allow me to offer another perspective, because if we are surrounded by counterfeit or poor quality products in Europe, is that not primarily because our countries are actually paying the price for Europeanist policies and internationalist and ultraliberal dogma? Is it not also the fault of the Commission, which still believes, despite the terrible financial, economic and social crisis we are facing today, that our borders should remain open to the four winds of brutal and unfair competition?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, yes, for the sake of democracy and freedom, we must reject ACTA at all costs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, what is the problem with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and this vote today? Millions of consumers in Europe have had difficulties with counterfeit products and tens of thousands of jobs have been lost as a result, but the majority in this House is on the point of rejecting ACTA. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have always said that we want a proper evaluation of ACTA and that we are only in favour of ACTA if it does not change anything for Europeans living in Europe. That is still true today. I advise every Member of this House to look again at the two legal reports from our independent parliamentary Legal Service which, in my opinion, come to a very clear conclusion about ACTA.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us in the PPE Group, the freedom of the Internet is one of the most important issues. Yesterday afternoon, it once again became clear who is actually fighting for the cause of freedom every day in this House, when we were discussing the agenda for this part-session and the groups which are allegedly in favour of freedom in the context of ACTA expressed their opposition to a debate on the breaches of the constitution and the intolerable situation in Romania. Ladies and gentlemen, what happened yesterday to your campaign for freedom and human rights in the European Union? I would like to see you taking a much more consistent and uniform position in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">My concern with regard to this discussion on ACTA is the way we deal with one another in an open democracy. I very much welcome the wide-ranging public debate. It should have taken place earlier and there should also be debates of this kind on other topics. I am also very pleased by the immense dedication of the younger generation who have shown an incredibly strong interest in and commitment to this subject. However, I found the disinformation campaign staged by some opponents intolerable, in particular, at the start of the debate on ACTA. We all remember the anonymous video containing a number of invented untruths which was made available on the net. This amounted to an attack on democracy. For this reason, I would like us to treat one another with respect, in particular in the light of the latest press release issued by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and by Mr Swoboda accusing us of a lack of transparency and of deception.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we have never asked for a secret vote, neither in committee nor here in this House. We have always said that we are in favour of postponing the matter, so that the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Commission have more time to complete their homework. However, it was Members from the S&amp;D Group and the Liberals who came up to me personally and said that they were in favour of ACTA, but that the pressure in their groups was so great that they needed my help. Nevertheless, we still did not ask for a secret vote.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">We have always been quite clear about the fact that we want to keep ACTA alive. We want to put it to rights and improve it, not kill it off. It is your group which is exerting the pressure on its Members and not allowing a free vote in committee and also here in plenary. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to remain democratic and to open up the vote in your group so that every Member of this House has the opportunity to vote tomorrow according to his or her convictions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Mr Caspary, I need to speak directly to you because I am gradually beginning to lose my temper over the question of why we are waiting for the Court of Justice of the European Union. I have to ask myself where the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) were 18 months ago when we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asked for the compatibility of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) to be evaluated by the Court of Justice. I have repeatedly said this to you too, Mr De Gucht. If this had happened, we would have had an opinion and a result from the Court of Justice today, the day before the vote. You are clearly applying double standards and, as Mr Leichtfried has said, this is nothing more than an attempt to postpone the issue, as you do not want ACTA to be rejected because it is wrong in political terms.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr Albrecht, all in good time! First of all, we have our own methods. We have the parliamentary Legal Service which has issued a clear statement on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The question is not whether it was right or wrong for the Commission to go before the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Commission has done this and it is a question of respecting other institutions, which means allowing them to give us their opinion. I think it is very important for us to ensure that the Court of Justice has the necessary time.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, my group has never said that it is unreservedly in favour of ACTA. We have always made it clear, most recently in April at a large press conference, that we also want the situation to be clarified once again. Unfortunately, the Commission informed us far too late, not until the Wednesday evening before the vote in committee, that it was prepared to make these improvements.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this case, the question is that when a patient goes to hospital with a minor cold, he deserves a proper diagnosis and he also deserves to be cured and not to be left to die. We want to cure ACTA and not to kill it off and that is the political difference between us.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card question. – Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Caspary how he can say that ACTA does not change anything in European legislation when we are right in the middle of reviewing the legislation on the protection of intellectual property and on the protection of personal data.

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Ms Castex, you are, of course, right. For example, we have adopted Mr Creutzmann’s report today in Parliament with a broad majority which concerns enforcing intellectual property rights on our European borders. All the groups agree that we need a reform of intellectual property in the European Union. This is a very good reason not to vote against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) tomorrow, but instead to delay the vote until the Court of Justice of the European Union has reached a decision, the Commission has done its homework and we, together with the other institutions, have reformed intellectual property in Europe. There are good reasons for postponing the vote. Then, in two years’ time, when all of this has been completed, we can calmly consider whether you want to oppose or accept ACTA, possibly together with us. However, please let us do it then and not tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to reassure Mr Caspary at once. No, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has never changed its position. I would, however, like to mention that at the beginning of this parliamentary term, when one of our fellow Members, Kader Arif, was coordinator of the Committee on International Trade (INTA), he led the S&amp;D Group, along with others, to present a resolution here warning against ACTA because we thought that this agreement had been poorly negotiated, that it was filled with ambiguities, and so on, and Mr Martin has defended this today. This resolution was put to the vote in Parliament and it was not passed; it is a non-resolution. It did not receive enough votes. The warning at the beginning of this parliamentary term was never heeded in this Chamber. What has happened since then? Civil society has spoken. We have had e-mails, e-mail campaigns, discussions, forums, and so on and, suddenly, our MEPs who did not vote, who distrusted ACTA at the beginning of this parliamentary term, will probably vote against ACTA today. That is interesting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We saw a similar case before: software patenting, with the Rocard report, two parliamentary terms ago I think, was swept up by the power of civil society. When civil society speaks, when direct democracy gets started and comes together with parliamentary democracy, then we have an extremely interesting equation which allows us to overcome problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what is happening today and that is what is interesting, my friends. When citizens understand, they act. It is up to us to make them understand. Now, we are against counterfeiting. There is still some way to go in this area, but I am pleased that tomorrow we will reject ACTA with an alliance between Parliament and civil society. That will be a red-letter day.</p>

This made it clear that dignity, the freedom to exchange information, the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, as well as freedom of expression, are not empty words, but are recognised as being basic rights in the EU, which should be fully respected in order to strike a balance with the protection of intellectual property.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We support the creation of a modern social pact which will be based on a sectoral approach with separate agreements, with each one of them focusing on specific types of intellectual property rights. I firmly believe that greater transparency also needs to be guaranteed during the negotiating process.

Yes, by voting against ACTA and in favour of freedoms.</p>

I very much agree we need measures to counter piracy and protect intellectual property, which is vital to business, but I cannot support this ACTA. It is not acceptable in its current form. It is too catch-all. Whilst the thrust of the agreement is worthy, the devil is in the detail. In the detail, we find that Internet service providers will be forced to spy on all their customers, Chinese-state style, becoming legally responsible for pirated files. Search engines could be closed for aiding and abetting.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this ACTA, we have what I call ‘pre-crime’, as in the movie Minority Report , where you can have your PCCs on the mere suspicion of infringement. You have a loose definition of commercial scale, which could see many law-abiding citizens prosecuted for very low-key usage. You have customs officers able to go through your files at airports, and we have this unaccountable ACTA committee which has the power to make changes without referring back to this Parliament or others.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Commission, its political allies in this Parliament, and you in particular, Commissioner De Gucht, have done everything possible to try to avoid a vote taking place on ACTA tomorrow because you are scared that it will be defeated, given the mass opposition that exists across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, when you spoke at the Committee on International Trade two weeks ago, you effectively said that, regardless of how Parliament votes tomorrow, the Commission would try to push ahead, regardless of what the result is. That represents a complete contempt for democracy, but at least you have been consistent in that contempt throughout this whole process of ACTA. In your letter to MEPs, dated 26 January, you accused those protesting against ACTA of basing their action on – and I quote – ‘misinformation, or possibly even worse, wilful misinterpretation of the content of the agreement’. What an outrageous statement! Who needs democracy and debate in society when we have the European Commission to tell us what is what. If there was any misinterpretation, if there is any misinformation, then that is due to the complete lack of transparency and the deliberate ambiguity contained in this agreement.</p>

Of course, genuine copyright and intellectual property right infringements must be prevented and owners’ rights protected, but the European Union is creating its own comprehensive police state with provisions such as the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order. Criminalisation opens up all kinds of sinister possibilities for suppressing free speech, dissent and alternative points of view.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let us get right to the point. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will encourage web blocks and measures for monitoring the Internet. It will put data protection and the secrecy of communications at risk. The vague wording of the agreement reads more like a political statement of intent than a contract under international law.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ACTA is a response to a general awareness of the damage caused by counterfeit goods in terms of the health and safety of our fellow citizens. European businesses lose EUR 250 billion each year, while 100 000 jobs are lost every year. Ultimately, ACTA does not establish new intellectual property rights, it is simply a question of the proportional implementation (see Article 6) of measures intended to combat the counterfeiting of physical goods.</p>

We must vote for ACTA as we did last year in the interest of the 38 signatory countries first and foremost, but also because it sets an example to countries such as China or India, which seemed to worry those opposed to ACTA.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has been a very serious political mistake, not to mention a legal one, because it has caused a worldwide reaction of immense proportions, and that is enough to say that it is a political mistake. Why immense? Because it has created the suspicion that access to the Web, which is a great modern revolution, would really be inhibited.</p>
      <p sl="it">Why is this? Because it has made the mistake of lumping together counterfeiting and piracy, which are two totally different issues. The way to combat counterfeiting has nothing to do with copyright. Then there is another mistake, in that it has excluded Parliament from an important activity that it has been doing for some time: creating a new copyright, although some people would like to retain the old copyright law, which existed before the Web.</p>
      <p sl="it">The point is that we have to work on copyright and put ACTA aside, as it is an obstacle. We have to reject it, exclude it, because it is an obstacle to our work. Fortunately, the Commission, after months and years of hesitation, has brought two important measures to the attention of Parliament: orphan works and the one regarding copyright management companies. This is positive; let us work on this rationally rather than just emotionally, but without letting ACTA get in the way.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would remind you that, according to figures from 2010, 85% of counterfeit goods come from China and 93% of counterfeit medicines come from India.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Members who are in favour of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have said that they are defending Europe’s competitiveness. I beg your pardon? The fact that the very states which produce the majority of counterfeit products are not covered by this agreement means that the entire coalition of the willing is completely pointless. It is futile and also brings huge problems for us when it comes to fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The whole agreement is characterised by a complete lack of legal certainty. The wording is completely open and means both everything and nothing. This is not what the European economy needs in terms of competitiveness. From this perspective, ACTA represents a move in totally the wrong direction.</p>

In the Committee on Legal Affairs, I waited for the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I did not hear a word. You refused to cooperate. You simply did not want to. Now it is clear that the Court of Justice is being used as an excuse to delay matters. Why did I refer to the broad scope for interpretation? You have asked two questions, so I unfortunately have to answer both of them. I referred to this because the vague wording about the Internet service providers monitoring the Internet in the role of deputy sheriffs can be interpreted in any way you want.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, one thing is quite clear. Anything that is worth nothing will not be stolen. Therefore, it is very important for us to make every effort to reach a good compromise in this debate. We are aware that various things need to be brought up-to-date. Copyright regulations need to be adapted to the new digital world. We understand the value of European cultural assets. Whether it can provide a livelihood for artists, journalists and authors will depend on the question of whether content will, in future, be paid for directly by consumers who value it and want to have it or whether it will only be possible to fund the content via advertising and promotions, in order to give artists and journalists an opportunity to earn a fair living.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we also need to revise the e-Commerce Directive. We need to answer simple questions such as: Is it possible to sell a product for less than the introductory price? What is the situation with price labelling on the Internet? How can we create certainty for our citizens with regard to copyright issues? I believe that the Commission and Parliament still have a great deal of work to do on drawing up the necessary regulations. I would like to know what the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will actually achieve, and this point has already been made today, if China, India and Brazil are not included.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – I believe that the opinion of the Court of Justice is important. However, many speakers have already emphasised the fact that this is also a political decision.

Ultimately, it is also about the question of how we deal with monitoring organisations which often impose unfair penalties on digital consumers and of what rights providers will have in future with regard to the distribution of content. This is the basis which we should be working on. Therefore, I am also in favour of postponing tomorrow’s vote.

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr Albrecht, of course I agree in general with what you have said. This is not about ensuring that we have a perfect system. It is about taking the first step. I agree that we must support this first step. We are allowed to have differing political opinions in this House. If we are supposed to take what is effectively a political decision, then it can be viewed differently by those on the left, on the right and in the centre. We should be tolerant about this.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the worry and concern shown by Europeans in recent times regarding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is entirely justified. In my view, ACTA correctly identifies the problems, which are the counterfeiting of consumer products and infringements of intellectual property rights, but the instruments that it proposes are not the right ones. Why is this?</p>
      <p sl="es">It is because it is a mistake not to distinguish between consumer goods and cultural goods, and not to distinguish between personal use and commercial use. It is because voting against ACTA means protecting authors and users, since these groups are not mutually hostile. It is because we need to make a firmer commitment to supporting innovation, in order to find the answers that guarantee respect for the rights of creators and the public. For all these reasons, our group will vote against this agreement tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I do not wish to end without reiterating my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Martin, on his good work and on the efforts made towards a good debate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am still convinced that the European Union would have been wise to negotiate an interpretative protocol in response to the questions and concerns that were raised as a result of the conclusion of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). I suggested that. Yet nothing was done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everyone would have benefited from this. Those who, for reasons of legal certainty, will vote in favour of a joint interpretation would have had the advantage of shedding light on the ambiguities decried by ACTA’s detractors. Those who will vote against the agreement, myself included, would have had the advantage of being able to make a fresh start on clearer concepts in the case of renegotiation. In all cases, an interpretative protocol would have bought us time. Now, we will have to start again from scratch with the hypothesis that we can unite the critical mass for a new start in the fight against counterfeiting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another lesson to be learned from this episode is that it is important from now on to involve Parliament in the definition of the negotiating mandate for any new treaty or international agreement. This would mean that Parliament, which, need I remind you, has the final say on this kind of agreement, could take responsibility from the beginning.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) does not protect us against dangerous counterfeit medicines with ingredients that have been manipulated, because ACTA is not concerned with the content of the pills, but only with the packaging. Instead, ACTA makes accessing effective generic medicines more difficult. The people whose lives and health depend on affordable generics have not been asked whether they would like to vote in favour of ACTA or whether they prefer not to have it at all. If we take the interests of these people into account in tomorrow’s vote, then there is only one route for us to take. We must vote against ACTA.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this debate in Parliament is the culmination of an exchange of views which has been heard throughout Europe as well as in many parts of Poland. The war of words has been joined by people for whom the ground-breaking social and cultural role of the Internet is of great importance. People are not protesting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement because they are against the protection of trademarks or intellectual property rights. What motivates us is the imbalance which ACTA creates between the rights of creators and producers, on the one hand, and the rights of Internet users, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Together with my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I am going to vote against ACTA, because we do not see cultural goods as nothing more than a product, which, like any other product, can only be bought by those who can afford to do so. We are against ACTA because we see that the Internet plays an extremely important role, not just as a provider of information, but also as a gateway to cultural property for all of us, building identity and a feeling of community. The immediate rejection of ACTA is, for us, the first step towards changing the way intellectual property is protected on the Internet. Our objective is to extend what is called permitted use, so that people do not have to fear any consequences if they have shared files privately with friends but do not share files commercially. We urge you to help change this law.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we must get rid of ACTA and I am pleased that the debate here in Parliament is moving in precisely this direction. ACTA is an attack on fundamental rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of information and communication and the right to informational self-determination. It is the whole host of vague legal terms which have opened the door to this. We are faced with the threat that legal protection and legal procedures will no longer be available. We are right to be concerned that providers will be forced to monitor the Internet, put web blocks in place and filter content. Ultimately, this could lead to law enforcement being privatised and the providers being turned into deputy sheriffs.</p>
      <p sl="de">The protection of individuals’ copyright must not, under any circumstances, lead to the freedom of information and communication being undermined. It is true that we need a modern copyright law which has a sensible balance between the interests of the originators and of the users. I would like the Commission finally to submit a proposal for this. ACTA will not help in this respect at all. Instead, it is forcing us to move in a very specific direction. This is why we must say ‘No’ to ACTA tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, intellectual property rights must be protected, but ACTA is not the solution. Even though much of the criticism of ACTA is based on myths and fallacies relating to an early draft put forward for negotiation, it is clear that the agreement has significant shortcomings. When we vote against it tomorrow, as we most likely will, I do not see it as the end, but the beginning of new efforts to achieve really good protection for intellectual property, but we must do this on a sectoral basis, considering each sector separately, so that we can safeguard respect for intellectual property rights all around the world while, at the same time, protecting human rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need to show our citizens that it is entirely possible to create these sector-specific agreements with complete transparency for citizens and in dialogue with civil society. As the ancient Romans said: Acta est fabula, the play is over.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, firstly, I would like to say that I am sorry that it has never been possible to debate the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) calmly in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you negotiated this agreement, yet neither you nor your services have been able to provide concrete and effective responses to the increasing numbers of questions and concerns from citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, throughout this entire campaign, the debates have focused on online rights and freedoms, but we have spoken very little about counterfeiting physical goods. However, this type of counterfeiting represents a loss of 30 to 40 000 jobs each year in France alone, and close to 100 000 in Europe. For our companies, it means an annual loss of several billion euro of turnover, as well as a significant loss in terms of tax revenue for Member States. Although counterfeiting is covered by most of ACTA’s provisions, counterfeiting physical goods has almost passed us by without mention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is the solution to combat the sale of counterfeit medicines, which represent a real threat to public health? What is the solution that will allow all of our companies to innovate, to create, without fear of plagiarism on the other side of the world?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the committees have already stressed their opposition to this agreement. Tomorrow, it is up to Parliament to confirm this vote and put an end to this controversial dossier. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a treaty that seeks to introduce a new framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, but does so without distinction, without distinguishing between commercial use for financial gain and consumer use by individual users not seeking profit.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think we need to fight the fake goods market, to combat counterfeiting, but without undermining the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In a nutshell, I believe that commercial interests must not allow us to eliminate civil liberties. For this reason, ACTA is the wrong way to go about this, which is why tomorrow’s vote is very important. Tomorrow, therefore, we need to say no to ACTA to ensure the transparency and protection of citizens’ rights.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, an ambiguous and unclear agreement is a poor agreement, irrespective of what the European Court of Justice thinks of it, and therefore we do not need to wait for the court’s opinion. From the little that is clear, we can see that the rights of undertakings are protected above those of citizens. This applies both to us in Europe and to the people in poor countries who are waiting in vain for legal generic medicines that are being seized in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, if the best defence for an agreement is that it does not change anything, the agreement itself is not worth anything either. Mr De Gucht, you say that this agreement does not threaten our freedoms, but instead protects our livelihoods. The problem is that the ‘we’ that you are talking about are long-established companies with old business models. The ‘we’ that I am talking about are the millions of people who have actively opposed ACTA, and it is their rights we are defending by voting ‘no’ tomorrow. It is democracy that will make the European Parliament vote ‘no’, not new facts.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would issue a word of warning that the fight is not over, however. The bad bits of ACTA will resurface in other legislation and initiatives like a monster in a second-rate zombie film. We therefore need a bigger change in intellectual property rights in order to defend the right to allow cultural growth, rather than the growth of profits.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, there is no doubt in my mind that we need rules in order to protect intellectual property. Citizens and businesses suffer loss when such protection is not in place. We therefore need to safeguard rights applicable to the Internet, because surfing the Internet is just like going to the market. And if you find something nice at the market, you have to pay for it. We must get used to the fact that we also need to pay for the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I wanted to say was that ACTA, the instrument we are debating today, is not the right instrument. The delegation of the Dutch Christian Democrats (CDA) to this Parliament therefore rejects ACTA. Moreover, what I have to say to Ms Stassen, though her chair is empty, is that the CDA has also rejected ACTA in the Dutch Lower House – because she makes it sound like it is a national matter. She has said her piece, but is no longer here with us when I actually have a chance to answer her question.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I believe that ACTA should be rejected because it raises too many questions and contains too many ambiguities. How does it address the Internet freedoms of an individual citizen? Are citizens’ fundamental rights recognised? Are rich countries being favoured at the expense of other countries? Will it bring any changes to current European legislation? We need clarification on all those questions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have the honour of belonging to a political group that accepts divergence when it is justified. These are the reasons why I have supported the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) since the start. First, I support it because piracy and counterfeiting are behind the constant rise in huge losses to the economy and employment capacity of the EU. Second, there cannot be effective protection of intellectual property rights without international cooperation. We can stop Chinese counterfeit goods at our borders, but we will not be able to do it in the US, Australia or Canada without an international agreement. Third, there cannot be effective protection of intellectual property rights without also covering piracy and counterfeiting on the Internet. Offering counterfeit goods on the Internet is no less serious than selling them in a street in Brussels or Strasbourg. Fourth, I believe that ACTA does not jeopardise civil liberties on the Internet. Fifth, intellectual property rights are fundamental rights of citizens, whereas piracy and counterfeiting are not.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I have been listening to this debate, but actually I do not know if we are all talking about the same thing. It really is very simple, because the story of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is a story firstly of arrogance, then of contempt, secret negotiations, requests for information about the progress of those negotiations, and refusals. It is also a story of revolt, because Internet users went on to the streets and something started which those gentlemen behind closed doors had not foreseen. This was followed by fear of the rebellion, and once that began, we began to see ACTA being abandoned. Governments started to back down, saying ‘actually we never wanted this, we did not know, we thought it was all about baseball boots – not about freedom, but about counterfeit trainers’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would therefore like to warn everyone who thinks of trying to get changes on Internet freedoms in through the back door: do not do it, because it does not pay. The revolt may happen again. If you want to say something worthwhile about freedom on the Internet, then say it openly. ACTA will die an orphan, but it will leave all the problems behind.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after this long and heated debate, only one thing is sure, and that is that nothing is sure!

I have not changed my mind about tomorrow’s vote, but there is no doubt that my motivation is even stronger.</p>
      <p sl="it">I understand and agree with the request to postpone the vote, but I do not accept that this should be due to Parliament being conditioned by the justice system. Getting politics to play a secondary role in a situation like this, bowing to the decisions of the judiciary, constitutes, I believe, an improper transfer of responsibility to which we cannot allow ourselves to stoop. I think the point is that tomorrow, Parliament needs to express a position.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreement as proposed is riddled with dangerous gaps, leaving legitimate concern for the violation of the right to personal data protection and, more generally, for the violation of the right to freedom of communication on the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that Parliament tomorrow must accept and welcome a request from over two and a half million citizens to Parliament via the Committee on Petitions (PETI).

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, there should have been a more respectful approach towards the prerogatives of Parliament, towards the need to avoid a confused agreement which tends to regulate matters that are, in themselves, too diverse.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will be voting against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) not because I am convinced that the fundamental rights of the Union are truly being violated to the core, but because counterfeiting and online piracy cannot be fought with the same weapons, almost as if counterfeiting a handbag or a drug is similar to downloading a song or a film from the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am against ACTA because the Commission and the Council hitherto have not yet regulated in a credible way an issue that is so very much in the limelight in the digital age, such as the protection of intellectual property on the web. I am opposed because current legislation would already enable action to be taken against those countries that make a living out of counterfeiting.</p>
      <p sl="it">I conclude by reiterating my opposition to an agreement that touches on highly sensitive issues, but does so in an inefficient, confused way, lacking a legal framework that is the only thing which would allow me to do anything other than vote against, as I shall be doing tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to remind you that, during the Industrial Revolution in England, the Luddites smashed their machines because they were afraid that they would destroy jobs. Nowadays, we must not end up in a situation where we restrict the Internet, which is the medium for the new technological revolution, because we do not know what we need to take into consideration in every aspect.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Legislation which operates in the real world obviously relates to the Internet environment as well. It goes without saying that it also needs to be adapted to it. However, this must happen without any constraint on its development.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I am opposed to ACTA for two reasons. The first reason is that it imposes responsibility for content on the Internet service providers. This will make the Internet much more difficult to access and more expensive, and it can turn into a dangerous weapon in the hands of two democratic governments. The second reason is that ACTA will not resolve the intellectual property issues. They will be resolved in a completely different way, including by changing business models.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there are many reasons for rejecting this treaty and these have been highlighted throughout the debate. Furthermore, having an international agreement on counterfeiting that does not include China and India is like signing a maritime treaty between landlocked countries. Finally, it is unacceptable to support a vague treaty from which the authors have deliberately excluded all democratic bodies since the beginning of the procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of these reasons raise questions for me, too. Why are several Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), particularly this morning, still counting on postponing tomorrow’s vote on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)? They are flogging a dead horse! Mr Fjellner was today’s example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The PPE Group replied to me this morning on Twitter saying that it wants to hear the opinion of the Court of Justice. I replied – but I had already been expecting this remark – that it was comical, bizarre, alarming even, that Commissioner de Gucht should be questioning the legality of the treaty that he had signed by asking for the opinion of the Court after the event.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why tomorrow, we will vote against this treaty, which is, unfortunately, a bad answer to a good question, the question of counterfeiting.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it has been said here that we must not bow to pressure from the street, but I say it was precisely the people on the street who returned us to Parliament. We represent their interests. If millions of young people are angered by new and unjustified legislation, we cannot ignore their protests. In my opinion, there is a need for clear legislation which protects intellectual property rights at international level, legislation which protects the creators of intellectual property from ‘pirating giants’ like China, the source of 60% of illegal goods. However, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is not the answer. Instead, it imposes misleading provisions – provisions which have also mobilised three million citizens to present a petition on ACTA to the committee on which I serve. I am also surprised by the words of Commissioner De Gucht, who seems not to recognise Parliament as a colegislator, saying he intends to ignore our decision to reject ACTA.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would therefore like to remind everyone that it is Parliament which appoints and dismisses the Commission. I hope tomorrow that we will finally lay ACTA to rest.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ‘no’ to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). That was the majority decision of the Committee on Development at its last vote, and in reaching it we weighed up various issues, such as: firstly, that only 11 countries took part in the negotiations, therefore limiting its global impact, as the countries where the majority of counterfeits come from, as well as the majority of developing countries, are not parties to the agreement; secondly, that we need to go further than this agreement and prevent the negative impact that it could have on access to drugs and public health in developing countries, and also in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The more than likely negative impact of ACTA on public health has been written about and criticised on countless occasions by non-governmental organisations, by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, and by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">Access to attainable drugs remains a key priority for people on low and middle incomes worldwide. The ACTA Treaty requires the signatories to pass laws and regulations that pose a risk to the availability of and access to generic drugs.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have said ‘no’ because we need to ensure the coherence of the Union’s policies with its development policy and find other ways of protecting intellectual property rights.</p>

The rapporteur has rightfully pointed out that it is not in our capacity to guarantee that the vague language of ACTA will not be used at some point for the wrong purposes. Civil society has mobilised against ACTA on a remarkable scale and has voiced concerns that the adoption of the agreement may potentially limit civil liberties.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, as well as the Member States, have failed to rebut those concerns and it cannot be denied that the text of the agreement is open to uncharitable interpretation.

There is a problem with piracy and while file sharing may be very advantageous for users, it is not beneficial to the same extent for the originators.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new business models which are constantly being referred to, such as iTunes, Spotify and Simfy, are, of course, based on copyright regulations, so there is no argument against them. In answer to the point that public libraries are wonderful and that we naturally need access to knowledge and culture, I would say that this is right. However, public libraries are financed using taxes and the authors are compensated. We need to find new models which will allow easy access to culture and knowledge in the digital world. However, there must be fair solutions for the originators, if we do not want to put our cultural diversity at risk.</p>

      <p sl="de">When we look at the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), it becomes clear that it is, to a certain extent, symbolic of a lack of transparency and democracy and of the violation of fundamental rights, because it was drawn up secretly behind the scenes using an undemocratic process and because the free use of the Internet was simply no longer possible and neither was there the freedom to use generic medicines to the degree that we currently do.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this treaty has got much more to do with the possible criminalisation of innocent third parties such as ISPs, and disproportionate actions against small businesses and even private individuals, than it has with the protection of legitimate copyright interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">If ACTA were interpreted to impose responsibility on service providers, they would introduce filters and monitors which would analyse data streams for offending content. We would then potentially have the machinery in place to do what China does to its Internet access in that country: monitor and filter out unsuitable political content.</p>
      <p sl="en">The losses claimed to have been incurred by the entertainment industry are exaggerated enormously. It cannot be presumed that every person who illicitly gains access to copyright material would otherwise have paid for it.

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, following today’s debate, I am much more convinced that ACTA is being politically misused. It is about rallying political support, regardless of the consequences, for unprotected intellectual property in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start with some procedural remarks. A number of Members, amongst them Mr Albrecht and Mr Scholz, have said that I did not properly inform the European Parliament and that I have contributed to secrecy. I have no problem with the Parliament having a completely different opinion to the one I have. That is what Parliament is for: to reflect all opinions in society. What I do not accept is this criticism, because from the moment that I took responsibility for this file, I have done everything possible to make the results of the negotiations public. And, by the way, I managed to convince our negotiating partners to do this. I have no problem with you disagreeing with me, or claiming that I should have followed another procedure. I will respond to that. But claims that I have tried to uphold secrecy in this simply cannot be taken seriously.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, it has been said – amongst others by Mr Rinaldi – that I have not listened to Parliament. There, Niccolò, I have to tell you that the last time the European Parliament pronounced on ACTA, in November 2010, a majority – albeit a slight one – voted for a resolution supporting ACTA. So listening to Parliament means listening to the majority of Parliament, it does not mean listening to an individual Member of Parliament, or to an individual group in Parliament, but to the majority. The last time that Parliament pronounced on ACTA, in November 2010, Parliament voted in favour of ACTA.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a question by Mr Tarabella.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Tarabella wants to know why I did not ask for the Court of Justice’s opinion earlier. We must look closely, Mr Tarabella, at the wording of the article on the ratification procedure in the Treaty, which says:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘A Member State, the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission may obtain the opinion of the Court of Justice as to whether an agreement envisaged is compatible with the Treaties. Where the opinion of the Court is adverse, the agreement envisaged may not enter into force unless it is amended or the Treaties are revised’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This says very clearly that we may ask for or request the opinion of the Court of Justice once the text of the treaty envisaged has been finalised, that is, once the negotiations have been concluded. That is the very idea behind this special procedure before the Court of Justice. That is what I have done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I am not the only one who has asked for an opinion from the Court of Justice, which was eventually requested and then withdrawn. If I may, Mr President, because I still need some time to answer all of these questions, I would like to read you a letter:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘The draft Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) would have legal implications in several fields of legislative competence of the European Parliament, including new ones, such as criminal law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘In order to have legal certainty, and to avoid that questions of the compatibility with the treaties arise during the ratification process, or after ratification of the agreement, we would like to request that the European Parliament seeks an opinion of the European Court of Justice concerning ACTA.</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘Thus, on the basis of Rule 90(7) of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, we request that the plenary vote be held on the following text: Pursuant to Article 218(11) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament submits the following request for an Opinion of the Court: Is the envisaged Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) compatible with the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Signed for the Greens/EFA Group: Rebecca Harms and Jan Philipp Albrecht’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must say that this is slightly different from what I heard this afternoon from Mr Albrecht. He has changed his opinion in the meantime, not me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also told that in fact, I want to use the European Court of Justice to postpone the whole discussion on this. I think this is an utterly light argument because in any case, we are going to have this discussion on all the topics that are discussed in ACTA. I think it would be very useful that we have the opinion of the European Court of Justice. I will come back to that later.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me now try to answer the substantive questions that have been put to me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Lange, you claim that we do not have the substantive law ready. This is true and it is also the main reason why I think we should go to the European Court of Justice so that they help us in formatting this whole discussion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I fear is that if you now vote it down – which obviously is on your minds – that we will no longer have that substantive discussion during this mandate. I think it would be a complete mistake not to have that discussion. By sending the whole file to the European Court of Justice, we create time for ourselves – a kind of time-out – so that we can discuss the substantive items that indeed have to be tackled sooner or later.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also have a question for Ms de Sarnez and several other MEPs. Why are India, Brazil and China not included in this negotiation, this agreement? It is quite simply because they do not want to be. They do not agree with it. Emerging countries are not in favour of protecting intellectual property. They are very reticent on this subject. The argument that nothing will be resolved if these countries are not involved is not valid then. For the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) actually seeks to strengthen our legislation, not only at our borders, but also at the borders of the other countries associated with this agreement. That is what it is about. If counterfeit products come, for example, from China, we must stop them not only at our borders, but also at the other borders of important markets for them. We will thereby stop counterfeiting from continuing. The idea that these countries must be involved in this agreement is not at all correct. Furthermore, if China does not agree on this subject, honourable Members, it is not because it is protecting fundamental rights, but because of other reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You say that only industrialised countries are involved. On this point, I could repeat my response but I think that there is another element that is not clear in all of these discussions and that is the debate on medicines. I have received thousands of e-mails on this subject too. Fortunately, all of these e-mails were identical; otherwise I would have had to read them all. Let us look at the bilateral agreements that we are negotiating, for example, with India. I have been asked several questions about this subject too. We have been very attentive in order to ensure that these agreements do not shut the door to generic medicines, quite the opposite. Furthermore, Ms de Sarnez – but I see that she has left the Chamber – there is a difference between generic products and counterfeit products. This is also a serious problem and a risk for public health. Some medicines are labelled as ‘generic’ but, in reality, these are counterfeit products, which sometimes even have the opposite effects to those listed on the packaging.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to Ms Bélier’s comment about ‘rejecting the world proposed to us by ACTA’, I can understand this argument coming from some groups, even though it surprises me. However, I do not understand why this is the argument of Parliament as a whole. That is rather strange.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me now come to who will, in fact, be the next speaker, David Martin, and what he has been saying in his previous speech.</p>
      <p sl="fr">David mentions the problem that this Treaty could be misinterpreted in the future; that it is not clear enough. Basically, I agree with that – not technically, but politically. Technically, it is not correct what you are saying – I am not saying you are not putting it correctly, but your analysis is not necessarily the correct one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For example, in relation to ‘commercial scale’, when you look at the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, it is very clear what ‘commercial scale’ is. But, of course, a citizen is not expected to look at the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice; that I agree with. However, this is a very clear concept.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, you say there is the issue of sanctions. Again, I agree, but you should also agree with me that the issue with criminal sanctions in a treaty is not something that has been negotiated by the European Commission; this has been negotiated by the Member States and is their sole responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once the text was ready, those Member States unanimously agreed to the text. Therefore, you cannot blame me for what the Member States have put into ACTA. This is out of our scope; I would say, unfortunately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, the role of Internet service providers ties in with what I want to say as a final point: the issue that they should start checking everything. Again, the European Court of Justice has been very clear on this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Very recently, in the Sabam v Netlog case, the European Court of Justice ruled that it is not possible to impose on intermediaries such as social networks a general obligation to monitor user data. That means that the European Court of Justice is looking into these matters; it is giving answers to these questions. That is why I am so surprised that you no longer want to have this opinion of the Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I understand as rapporteur you have to reflect the opinion of Parliament and the opinion of the committee, but as far as I know, you started by putting those questions to me. The idea was that you would put those questions to the Commission and that we would try to give answers, and it was at that very moment in time that I said: OK, let us also ask the European Court of Justice what they think about this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But afterwards, you changed your minds; OK – that is up to you. That is your democratic responsibility. I think it is also the responsibility of the European Commission to be straightforward in this. We need a discussion on intellectual property; we need a discussion on how to enforce intellectual property. I think also we need the guidance of the European Court of Justice on this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we will continue with this demand for an opinion from the Court of Justice and come back to you – obviously not only to the European Parliament, but also to our negotiating partners, if it were proved that there are serious problems in this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think we have had a very good debate both here inside the Chamber and a parallel debate taking place on Twitter, which has been very highly informed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think there has been one misunderstanding in the debate, which is the role of the Commission here. I think people, particularly outside this House, have to understand that the Commission not only has the right, but has the duty to defend its proposal and has a duty to advocate its proposal, and that with the way the institutional triangle works, it is then up to Parliament and the Council to accept or reject the Commission’s position, and that is where we are now.</p>
      <p sl="en">The one thing that is worrying me about this debate is the presumption on some benches that if you listen to ordinary citizens, you are being populist. But if you give in to the big commercial lobbies, you are being responsive. That is not a distinction that I can accept.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are two demographics that I have found who have been opposed. There has been general opposition to ACTA, but two demographics in particular have expressed concern about ACTA. The under-25s who regard the Internet as a zone of freedom and an open area for expression, and I do not think ACTA has successfully reflected their concerns. Interestingly, the other demographic has been people from central and eastern Europe who know what it is to have their freedoms curtailed and have expressed great concern about the way ACTA might be implemented. So I understand where the people have come from on this issue and I think we are absolutely right as a Parliament to respond to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also take from this debate though, both on the Internet and in this room, that there is no one who really opposes the idea that rights holders should get a decent reward for their efforts. What they object to is, perhaps, overreaching the proper definition of reward and curtailing freedom in providing that reward. What we have to strive for now, both as a Commission and as a Parliament, is the balance between ensuring that rights holders do get a return for their investment, for their effort, whilst maintaining Internet freedom. That is the challenge we all face in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I believe that intellectual property rights must be afforded better protection, including in the online environment. However, this must not be done, under any circumstances, by infringing fundamental rights, as is happening, unfortunately, in the case of ACTA. The agreement blatantly infringes at least three fundamental rights, namely, the right to protection of personal data, the right to privacy and the right to confidentiality, which is also the clear conclusion from the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If ACTA were to come into force, it would force Internet service providers not only to monitor users’ entire activities on a large scale, but also to pass on possible irregularities detected to the holders of intellectual property rights. These measures are not only excessive and disproportionate, but are also illegal as they create a private system of law enforcement where the service providers and rights holders are the police and judges in cyberspace, to the detriment of the judicial authorities. For these reasons, I believe that ACTA is unacceptable in this form and must be rejected by Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="sk">ACTA has been highly controversial from the very outset. Counterfeiting and piracy have recently increased significantly. The consequences of the growth in such illegal activities have extremely serious consequences, which range from economic losses to health and safety risks to European consumers. Infringement of intellectual property rights harms growth, competitiveness and innovation; this causes substantial damage every year to European companies and puts European jobs at risk. I firmly believe that the EU needs an effective tool in its efforts to protect intellectual property rights. As it stands, ACTA is not acceptable. It does not meet the requirement to strike an appropriate balance between enforcement of intellectual property rights and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, the right to privacy and protection of personal data and confidentiality of communications, and the right to due process. If we want to protect and enforce one set of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, we can hardly endanger other kinds of fundamental rights! The core provisions of ACTA bring about a feeling of legal insecurity. The protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is our absolute priority, but ACTA is causing considerable concern. We need a modern tool which will not prejudice the rights also guaranteed by the Charter and the European Convention. ACTA in its current version is unacceptable, and we therefore call on the Commission to take urgent action and to present new and better quality proposals for effective tools to combat counterfeiting and piracy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement deals with three important issues: 1) the commercial right to use a trademark; 2) the rights of Internet users to operate in the digital environment (Article 27); 3) the entitlement of the creators of intellectual property to the financial benefits of marketing their works.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There are no serious doubts about points one and three, although they do need clarification, but there may be a great many doubts over Article 27(1) to (8) and, in particular, paragraph 4, in which online service providers are required to breach the right to the protection of personal data. Paragraph 6 is not acceptable either, as it speaks of the circumvention of ‘an effective technological measure’ and of devices which are ‘primarily’ – but not exclusively – designed or produced to be used for this kind of circumvention thanks to ‘computer programmes’ which they contain.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to point out that in 2005, Parliament rejected at second reading a report drafted by the Committee on Legal Affairs entitled ‘Patentability of computer-implemented inventions’. This means that computer programmes cannot be patented, and the big computer firms cannot forbid the use of their devices for the design of new, innovative computer programmes by European IT developers, and this includes programmes for use on the Internet. This would hamper innovation in the field of new IT applications, for example.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should take the obvious case of fake goods out of ACTA and give detailed attention to intellectual property rights in the Internet and how to protect them, on condition, however, that the open source principle in the Internet will be maintained.</p>

      <p sl="hu">There have been heated debates recently about certain new provisions of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement regarding online piracy. This is because many believe that these rules violate the freedom of speech and expression, and the freedom of information. The Hungarian delegation to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) believes that a satisfactory and reassuring answer must be given to these concerns of citizens and civil organisations, and we therefore supported the European Commission’s decision to have the European Court of Justice issue an independent legal opinion on the compatibility of this international agreement with EU law and on the matter of the violation of liberties. In line with this, the group of Hungarian Members within the PPE Group supported the fact that the European Parliament postpone its decision until said opinion is issued. The Hungarian delegation to the PPE Group believes that we should pay attention to the complaints expressed by numerous citizens and civil organisations in connection with the agreement. Since these could not be settled, the delegation made the responsible choice in light of these concerns and legal uncertainty and voted against the conclusion of the agreement. The Hungarian delegation to the PPE Group is of the opinion that to treat the fight against piracy and the fight against counterfeiting together was a flawed concept from the beginning. Our delegation continues to urge action against counterfeiting. Due to the influx of counterfeit foreign goods, tens of thousands of jobs are in jeopardy, and counterfeit drugs are endangering the health of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Should intellectual property be protected? It most certainly should. Does the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement provide the right protection? No. It is very important for Europe that intellectual property be protected. Knowledge is an area in which we can still enjoy a competitive advantage in world terms. We ought to remember this. This does not mean we have to accept every proposal or every agreement. It is true that the Commission has asked the European Court of Justice for its opinion on ACTA. Regardless of the legal opinion, we as Parliament are entitled to make a political evaluation. We can reject ACTA. After all, even a positive verdict from the ECJ will not change the way many Europeans feel threatened by the agreement. By rejecting ACTA, we will make it possible to close this chapter and start again. I do not believe ACTA can be improved. It is better to start again than to try to repair something which cannot be repaired. It is a waste of time.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Rapidly developing new technologies, including the Internet, need to be regulated in new ways at European level, and this is obvious to all of us. However, an attempt to combine the fight against piracy and counterfeiting with preserving freedom on the Internet, such as the one put forward in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, has drawn opposition in many circles. I shall be voting against ACTA. I do think intellectual property rights should be protected. We must also settle certain matters relating to the Internet. However, this must be done in a way which is clear and is acceptable to a variety of groups in society. This cannot be done either by adding a provision which is mainly about counterfeit goods but which otherwise is unrelated to the agreement as a whole. It is certainly the case that the matters which ACTA has attempted to solve do have to be solved, but not in the way ACTA tries to do. We need to keep working on unsolved problems, but as well as consulting with legal experts, we also need to take on board the views of a variety of other groups in society. A new document, arrived at by negotiation, will certainly be accepted by Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="bg">No one can deny the need for an international agreement, binding the maximum number of countries to respect the right to intellectual property. The EU is a global leader in the field of innovations, patents and scientific development. For our continent lacking in natural resources, the successful protection of this type of property is crucially important to the prosperity of all Europeans. Nevertheless, I will vote without hesitation against ACTA because the agreement has failed on the key point – to resolve the conflict between the protection of intellectual property and civil liberties. This is the main underlying reason giving rise to the outburst of unprecedented civil discontent. The numerous discussions pinpointed exactly the controversial areas creating an opportunity for abuses. It is sufficient for us to mention two of them. Firstly, the lack of a precise definition of the key term ‘commercial scale’ as grounds for prosecution and, secondly, the possibility of Internet service providers being forced to monitor their customers’ behaviour. This danger has been explicitly confirmed by the European Data Protection Supervisor. These are two clear examples of ACTA’s failure. I firmly believe that every time Parliament is faced with such a conflict, it will always side with fundamental rights and freedoms. In fact, this will happen by a huge majority, just as I expect tomorrow in this Chamber, which I will be joining.</p>

      <p sl="sk">International piracy and counterfeiting account for approximately EUR 150 billion per year. We need to safeguard intellectual property rights and provide authors with protection of their rights. Infringement of these rights harms growth, competitiveness and innovation. However, we also need to consider whether the means to protect these rights enforced by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement are adequate for the purpose for which they are intended.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The implications of the implementation of ACTA with regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union are questionable. Privacy and data protection, together with freedom of expression, have always been regarded as core elements of the European model.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A binding interpretation and analysis, which will eliminate all doubts, is therefore necessary. I do not support the adoption of the agreement as law without these, without a review by the European Court of Justice, and without broad consultation in which all of the parties concerned are represented.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I was disappointed by the attitude adopted by the parliamentary majority towards ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, and I particularly disagree with the irresponsible anti-campaign of left-wing and liberal MEPs. I believe that the appropriate solution would be for Parliament to postpone the final vote and wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice on the compatibility of the agreement with EU law and on the violation of liberties. Only in possession of the expert opinion of the Court of Justice can Parliament take a responsible decision. A negative vote by Parliament would undo the results of years of international negotiations. I agree that we should take the opinions of the public, of EU citizens into account when deciding on important matters that concern them, but we should not entrust the legislative process to manipulated mass movements. Those who criticise the agreement are often not even familiar with its actual text, and I believe that Parliament should have acted differently when seeking to dispel concerns about infringements of rights. The parliamentary legal opinions requested by the Committee on Legal Affairs further proved that ACTA does not represent a threat to rights relating to personality, and the parts of the agreement that are being brought up to alarm people do not apply to the actions of private individuals. EU competitiveness greatly depends on our achievements in respect of intellectual property rights, as the EU society is an innovative society. Intellectual property rights are the engine of the EU economy, and they must be guaranteed appropriate protection at international level as well. The debate that emerged in connection with ACTA indicates that we will need to approach issues of similar importance far more carefully in the future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The problem with ACTA is twofold: on the one hand, work on ACTA began even before the Lisbon Treaty, that is to say, the rules by which the European Commission was governed were different, so the Commission is now required to discuss the matter ‘behind closed doors’. Another, and probably the greatest, problem is the threat of restrictions on fundamental civil liberties. Intellectual property should, of course, be protected. I am not therefore saying that everything in this agreement was negative; many of its features are already present in existing regulations. However, we must make greater efforts to find a solution to protect intellectual property that would take into account the views of a broad section of civil society. I would like to point out that despite the non-conclusion of ACTA, the debate surrounding this document has brought about a situation whereby copyrights have started to be taken into account. In practice, therefore, legislation in this field is finally being used. It should also be noted that the non-conclusion of this document is a clear example of how every EU citizen can influence decisions made in Brussels. It was, in fact, members of the public who, through their lobbying, activity and highlighting weaknesses, forced many members to correct or change their opinion on ACTA. I firmly believe that in the future, too, citizens will not hesitate to express their opinion on other important topics, because they are affected by every decision we take.</p>

      <p sl="et">Along with the members of my group, I decided to vote against concluding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) because the trade agreement puts copyright above the right to the protection of privacy, and as a liberal, I find that utterly unacceptable. I based my decision on the negative assessment by the five pertinent committees of the European Parliament. The following are the main areas of controversy to which the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Justice Committee, the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy drew attention in their assessments: under the pretext of curbing piracy, ACTA gives the authorities great authority to control the Internet; it creates the preconditions for extrajudicial surveillance activity, and mere suspicion is sufficient to transmit sensitive personal information to copyright owners; several concepts that possess a legal dimension are not defined and permit countries to interpret them depending on the interests of the moment; there is a risk that business secrets will be leaked, because the agreement does not guarantee any confidentiality for the relevant information; the objective of preventing counterfeit medicines from entering the market is not achieved, and the agreement would instead limit the availability of cheaper generic medicines; and, of course, the secrecy in which the agreement was drafted. In supporting ACTA, the Commission confirms that the agreement will protect European jobs and innovation, increase economic growth and fight crime and the entry of counterfeit medicines into the market. These are commendable objectives, but there are, unfortunately, serious shortcomings in the technical formulation of the agreement. The fact that the question of whether the rights of citizens might be infringed has been submitted to the European Court of Justice does not relieve us of the obligation to deal with the agreement here and now. There are, after all, other questionable areas in the agreement, such as the inadequate definition of concepts, provisions that allow diverging interpretations, etc.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was, from the start, negotiated without the involvement of civil society. European businesses and European consumer organisations were not invited to talks on the ACTA Treaty, and had no opportunity to influence the form of the treaty, while, for reasons unknown, some supranational businesses were there even at the birth of the treaty. The threat to the transfer of generic medicines, the possible problems with plant seeds and a range of other impacts disappeared in the storm surrounding the fight against Internet piracy. The ACTA Treaty, however, also includes provisions that might threaten basic human freedoms, such as the right to a fair trial, for example. Article 27 paragraph 3 of the treaty would allow private firms to enforce the law. The right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence or right of appeal, however, are a cornerstone of European civil rights. Europeans have always stood up for these freedoms, and have always fought for them. It is therefore not possible to support – with a clear conscience – a treaty which, through vague formulations, allows civil rights to be handed over from the courts to non-European private companies. Today, the European Parliament again has a chance to show that it is the final barrier between European citizens and the arbitrary will of certain governments and supranational businesses, and to reject the ACTA Treaty. Let us do this resolutely and quickly. If we need to amend the European legal framework, let us do so ourselves, and not under some trans-oceanic tutelage.</p>

      <p sl="en">ACTA is seriously flawed both in terms of process and substance, and we, as parliamentarians, can only say yes or no under the current procedure. The diplomatic negotiations of ACTA took place under a veil of secrecy. It took leaked documents for repressive mechanisms such as luggage checks at airports or the ‘3-strikes and your Internet is cut-off’ clause to be exposed and dropped. This is a crude and misguided international enforcement deal that tries to address online copyright infringements with the same legal instruments used to combat the counterfeiting of goods. Fake medicines are a matter of life and death. Threats to health and safety unquestionably require the firmest and most robust measures possible. However, applying such draconian methods to the digital world comes at an unnecessary, unacceptable and counterproductive cost in terms of privacy, technological innovation and access to knowledge. To the Commissioner and those colleagues who argue that we should wait for the European Court’s opinion, I say the following: even if the opinion deemed ACTA compatible with EU legislation, I find its process flawed enough and its substance politically unacceptable to warrant its rejection tomorrow.

      <p sl="cs">In February 2010, I and others set in train the pressure from the European Parliament to strip away the secrecy surrounding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and, at the same time, I drew attention to problematic provisions of the treaty that would be difficult to ratify. Unfortunately, the European Commission failed to heed my warnings and those of the experts. The very idea of a treaty that left out China and other sources of counterfeits on the EU internal market, and which failed to differentiate between measures suitable for offline and online environments, was flawed. Within my role as rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I pushed for an amendment in relation to the insufficient guarantees of basic human rights and freedoms, protection of personal data and a fair trial in the ACTA Treaty. The general lack of clarity of some ACTA provisions led us to declare that it was incompatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Our decision tomorrow is extremely important, as many citizens are putting their trust in us to correct a situation brought about by Member States and the Commission. The issue of what will follow our vote is no less important. Based on my proposal, the Commission will have to draw up an EU Code of Online Rights this year, which will ensure that the rights of Internet users are protected so that no similarly flagrant threats to their rights can take place in the future.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Although the main objective of ACTA, in particular, the protection of intellectual property rights, should be supported, this agreement is so vaguely drafted that it allows all kinds of interpretations. This puts the freedom of ordinary Internet users at risk and provides insufficient guarantees for the protection of consumer privacy. In addition, we could ask serious questions about the effectiveness of this agreement given the fact that countries that produce the largest number of counterfeit products have not signed it. My group is of the opinion that the Commission ought, first of all, to come up with a proposal for the revision of the e-Commerce Directive. We are also developing a proposal at the moment that is supposed to create a new framework for enforceable intellectual property rights that can protect authors and artists and encourage innovation but which is, at the same time, consumer-oriented and in line with the principles of civil liberties and privacy. I do hope that the Commission will learn its lessons from this debacle. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has been a fully-fledged colegislator, also when it comes to international agreements. The Commission would therefore do well to ask for a negotiating mandate from the legislator before the negotiations begin. The time when Parliament’s arms could be twisted, first following SWIFT and now ACTA, is clearly over.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Giovanni La Via, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the mandate for the trialogue on the 2013 draft budget (2012/2016 (BUD)) (A7-0215/2012).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-532-000" speaker_id="96816" name="Giovanni LA VIA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Italy" birth_date="28-06-1963" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="IT">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the mandate for the trialogue comes today at a time of crucial importance for Europe, but, first and foremost, for the Europe of tomorrow. The European Council on 28 and 29 June decided to adopt a series of measures to ensure that Europe is financially stable and competitive. This can only delight me, given that Heads of Government have essentially indicated, as a way out of the crisis, in order to build a stronger Europe, what we have been stressing since the beginning of this process: support for growth, for competitiveness and for employment, first and foremost for young people, as well as backing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
      <p sl="it">These are the priorities that we have set ourselves as a Parliament, aware of the pressing need to revive our economy, a process which must necessarily involve competitive growth in the European system, accompanied by measures to ensure considerable support to help young people integrate into the world of work. Then there is the need for a sufficient level of payments to cover the costs of implementing European programmes and projects, especially under Headings 1a, 1b and 2.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we know, this is one of the central issues of the negotiations, perhaps the most difficult one of all, given the different directions in which Member States have been heading up to now. However, I want to recall one point, a passage from the Council’s conclusions, which we wish to include in our report for tomorrow’s vote, via an oral amendment in which the Council states that the EU will continue to do everything required to bring Europe back on the road to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It seems clear that such a manifestation of political will has to be followed up by active commitment on the part of all Member States to do whatever is needed to achieve such goals, restoring public confidence and giving fresh impetus to growth. Let me also note that the payment appropriations proposed by the Commission in its draft budget are based on estimates carried out on Member States and revised downwards by the Commission, and which Member States must then, of course, meet.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to outstanding commitments or reste-à-liquider (RALs), and to the interinstitutional meeting on payments on 30 May, I would like to add that I consider it essential for the proper conduct of this year’s process, and for a result that is truly focused on the needs of European citizens, that constant monitoring of expenditure be put in place, capable of accounting for needs and identifying future trends. For this reason, I believe it is essential to ensure close interinstitutional cooperation, which has, unfortunately, been lacking.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must also avoid what happened during last year’s process, so as to adequately cater for the 2012 payment needs through an amending budget. Considering that 2013 is the last year of the financial perspectives and that we expect a physiological increase in payment levels, it will be even more important to avoid the dangers of deferring 2012 payments to 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the centre of the debate, however, as well as payments, there is a need for a sufficient level of funding and commitments, because we believe that in a time of crisis, as the Council too has stated, we need more Europe, not less Europe, and for this reason, in terms of commitments, we need to strengthen our political priorities and promote the necessary investments for growth and the creation of new jobs in order to help get us out of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">One last matter that is certainly important is the financing of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). We have already taken note of the Commission’s proposal to use some of the resources saved through cuts within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), but I would like to reiterate the point that Parliament intends, in any case, as agreed in the Joint Declaration, to make full use of all means available within the financial regulation and the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by thanking my colleagues and especially the shadow editors for their work and, since the Council is not present, allow me to extend to Commissioner Lewandowski alone an invitation to close interinstitutional cooperation throughout the process, which I hope will be a success and provide adequate financial allocation in the interests of European citizens and within a timescale envisaged under the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are two parallel procedures as usual on the basis of our proposal for the 2013 budget and this is being done in the very specific climate of today’s Europe. These are the fiscal consolidations seen as condicio sine qua non of sustainable development in Europe and, on the other hand, even at a time of crisis, the need for investment to create conditions for future growth and jobs. This was clearly stated in the conclusions of the recent European summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the answer as presented by the Commission in the 2013 draft budget is the correct one and I think the mandate of Parliament, as expressed by the rapporteur, Mr La Via, is going in the same direction. We need restraint – that is clear – in administration; there are performance savings in the other areas, very restrained growth of commitment, 2% only at the end of the financial perspective but, on the other hand, we need a sufficient level of payments to pay out what is legally binding – what is financially and legally binding for 2013 – and this is the end of the financial perspective that cannot come as a surprise to anybody. At the end of the financial perspective the programmes are gaining maturity and the payments are accelerating, so the bigger need for payment.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also the specificity of the 2013 budget; the n+2 rule and the n+3 rule means that we should pay at the latest in 2013 for the commitments from 2010 and 2011. Meeting of the payment obligations is not my duty. This is a collective duty of the European Union. I underlined the areas with the biggest growth potential – research, development and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Deferring payments is not an option because it either results in a liquidity problem in the Member States or a shortage of investment possibilities and increasing appeals for the future. That was clearly reflected in the discussion over the payment methodology agreed by the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Perhaps that is a modest forecast for the future on the payment levels at the end of May.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we see a lot of understanding of the logic of the multiannual financial perspective for the annual budgets at the end of the annual perspective in the mandate as expressed by Mr La Via. What is coming on the other side, in the Council, is a matter of concern. There is a propensity to cut, even though knowledge is widespread as to what the real needs are for 2013, as we are not basing our forecasts and our draft budget on our own assumptions. This comes from the Member States – we are cutting. We are less optimistic than the Member States themselves in shaping the level of payments for 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, I believe that we are able to find interinstitutional cooperation. I have to thank the rapporteur for already making the indicative list of pilot projects and preparatory actions available and making implementation in 2013 easier. Once more, I am confident that even under the specific extreme conditions of our time, we can find a proper way of dealing with the budget for the next year.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the countries of the EU are making savings, and that is what the EU also has to do. Despite this, the Commission is proposing an increase of almost 7% in the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In my country, Finland, an increase in the EU budget of this sort would either mean a cut in the national budget of EUR 70-100 million or more debt. That also happens to be precisely the same sum that the Finnish Government decided to cut from health care.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Today, however, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The European External Action Service is proposing an increase of 5.7%; the main reason for this is the fact that the security situation in Afghanistan and Iraq has become so much worse, and security costs money. At the same time, though, those involved in the EU’s external relations say that the situation in those areas has stabilised. We need to be consistent in what we say: the situation has either improved or it has not.</p>
      <p sl="fi">My message is that we have to make savings. Of course, we have to ensure that EU officials are safe, but the money has to be found elsewhere. The EU cannot keep proposing that more money should be spent on this and that. The time has come to make savings, especially if we are lecturing the Member States about saving money.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Giovanni La Via, for his extensive work on this. In the time that is available to me, can I say that I understand that some Member States may wish to reduce their contributions to development aid in these very difficult times, but the 0.7% is pegged to GNI. As GNI goes down, it is understandable that the percentage should go down, but surely it should not be double jeopardy for the people in the poorest parts of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind this House that 23 000 children continue to die each and every day. It used to be 36 000 children per day. Look at the progress we have made. We can make more progress. So let us keep it pegged to GNI. There should not be a double jeopardy. Within the next generation, 92% of the two billion people born will be born into the developing world. There will be massive migration from south to north if we do not meet our commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I make a special plea. It is fine if we have to reduce the amounts, but the GNI should not be reduced as well. Congratulations to Britain for striving to move ahead, and to Denmark which is already at one percent. They show that it can be done, even at a time of retrenchment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as rapporteur for budgetary issues in the Committee on International Trade, I strongly support activity that stimulates economic growth, improves bilateral relations and contributes to global stability and solidarity. For that reason, I call for the maintenance of funding for Aid for Trade, ICI/ICA Plus and MFA. I also call for improved funding to finance activity that directly contributes to higher growth and employment, such as the internationalisation of EU business through improved SME access to high-growth countries, assistance to trading partners in the southern and eastern neighbourhoods, as well as resources for the existing high-level dialogues with USA, Russia, China and emerging countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these activities, if well executed, will prove very beneficial to all EU citizens. I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr La Via.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr La Via for his report, but I think that employment should be one of Europe’s priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that Europe must now make all of the necessary efforts to develop real social governance and that can be achieved through measures which favour social convergence and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 2013 budget must support flagship initiatives, including the initiative in favour of innovation but, although the 2013 budget is the last budget in the current multiannual framework, it should not be limited to paying for programmes that are in the final stages of implementation. It should enable us to create an environment in which we can help young people who are looking for work and promote small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the main job creators in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must not wait until 2014 to continue combating unemployment and youth unemployment in particular. The European Social Fund (ESF), a key instrument for social policy, must be reassessed and reoriented. We must support the development of appropriate skills for sectors affected by labour shortages and we must therefore strengthen programmes such as PROGRESS, EURES and the Progress Microfinance Facility. Finally, innovative measures and measures in favour of social progress undertaken by companies, whether they are very small, medium or large, must absolutely receive financial support from the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as a Member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I disagree with many of my fellow Members concerning the proposed financing for the ITER programme. As the rapporteur on this committee, I can tell you that we were very much in agreement concerning the principle that the budget should reflect the priority objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. From the perspective of our committee, this means three things in particular: focusing on energy policy and, most importantly, the SET-Plan, prioritising research and innovation and providing support for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, once again this year, the debate on the EU budget is being held against the background of an economic and social crisis that is testing the budgets of all the Member States prepared on the basis of more rational public spending.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards cohesion policy, we all know that it is the main and most appropriate investment instrument in terms of delivering growth and job creation in the European Union. We had a large number of delayed payments at the end of 2011 that should have been addressed by allocating adequate payment appropriations in 2012. Shortfalls in payments are likely to worsen in 2013, when the application of cohesion policy programmes is expected to accelerate.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Parliament, Commission and Council should therefore immediately analyse the figures and requirements, in order to ensure that the implementation of programmes for 2013 is not jeopardised. The European Parliament should oppose any potential reduction in the level of payment appropriations in comparison with such requirements.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, with an increase of 1.6%, the agricultural budget will actually rise very modestly next year with respect to the 7% overall increase proposed by the Commission. The increase in the agricultural budget is, therefore, largely due to the phasing in of income support in new Member States. However, in times of economic crisis, I believe that we should look critically at spending here, too, since many Member States need to tighten their belts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will also try to do that. What then are our priorities for the 2013 budgetary procedure in terms of content? Price volatility, Commissioner, is a growing problem and one that will not go away. We therefore propose setting up a pilot project that will help farmers to deal with these increasingly volatile markets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are also unhappy that the Commission is so poorly implementing the pilot projects that were previously set up, for example, the prices and margins observatory, which is important for farmers who often get a bad price from the market. The Commission has committed itself to doing one or two things in that area but we have seen very little in terms of results.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My last point, Madam President: I would like to call on the Commission to provide a sufficient margin for emergencies. You know that agricultural markets can react very quickly and that an emergency situation can arise very quickly, as was the case last year with EHEC in the fruit and vegetable sector. As a result, you need to ensure that we, as Parliament, as the Committee, are able to respond in a timely fashion.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at such a complicated time of spending rationalisation, restraints and restructuring of expenditure, defining a reasonable balanced budget, as our rapporteur Mr La Via has done, is a clear sign of how we can do well even in a context of great difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="it">That said, as the LIBE Committee, we take note of the information that, once received from the Committee on Budgets (BUDG), was then tangibly transposed into positive assessments. I am referring to Frontex, as well as to the question of the Refugee Fund. However, when it comes to the safety of citizens, we believe that in 2013, the bridge year for the next financial perspective, something more tangible needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="it">I refer, in particular, to that list of political priorities which, Madam President, leaves no reasonable doubt as to the efficacy of the fight against organised crime. In this area, more can probably be done, and we are confident that the same indication can later be drawn up by the Committee on Budgets.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would like to express the committee’s position in favour of a consistent European Union budget. The Union budget is a catalyst for investment and periods of crisis are the very times when the EU needs a budgetary voice, in order to create employment and promote growth in our countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">2013 is a pre-election year, so the Committee on Constitutional Affairs believes that there should be specific funding for informing the public about what is at stake in the European elections, and also for informing them of their rights to take part in the political life of the Union. For this same reason, there should be a consistent budget for the Communicating Europe in Partnership programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to point out that the European citizens initiative came into force in April. Some initiatives have already been put before the Commission. Hearings in Parliament will probably be needed, and the budgetary resources should be provided in order to organise them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the Community budget, it is now the Council’s credibility which is at stake. Last Friday, the Council unanimously adopted a growth pact. It has decided to allocate an additional EUR 55 billion of Structural Fund money over two years to finance future investments. It has not specified where this additional budget will be allocated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is an intelligent, pragmatic and reasonable decision. It respects the expenditure ceilings that were set five years ago. It is based on the considerable efforts made by the Commission – to which I would like to pay tribute – and by national governments to identify economically sound projects. However, this will not mean anything unless the announced funds can actually be mobilised, that is, committed and paid into the budget for the current year and into the 2013 budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question is: from next week, are the Permanent Representatives going to bury behind closed doors the solemn decision taken by the Heads of State or Government some days ago?</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the Union is suffering today, if economic actors have lost faith, if the financial markets are sceptical, if the citizens have doubts, it is because, all too often, governments play on the diverse range of bodies which represent the Union in order to take contradictory decisions. No one understands what has really been decided any more.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, when the house is on fire, this little game is no longer possible. It is now the responsibility of the Cypriot Presidency – and I am sorry that it is not here for this debate – to faithfully apply the decisions taken and to thereby stop the Council from looking powerless or hypocritical.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, we are obviously all referring to the Council meeting last week during which it was decided to mobilise EUR 120 billion. This is not a minor issue, especially because the Council had so far placed the emphasis solely on budgetary austerity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Here in March, during a similar debate, I said that they were following the wrong policies and needed to change course. Fortunately, it seems that the Council is beginning to change course, and we are not only talking about budgetary discipline, which is needed, but also about promoting sustainable growth. Therefore, mobilising EUR 120 billion is significant, but we cannot forget that we already have the tools to mobilise and invest in the European economy, in the form of the Union budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are talking about a budget that makes EUR 151 billion available to the European Union, which is more than was approved last week. Now the finance ministers just need to follow the course set by the last Council meeting, put it into practice and apply it to the European Union budget. It needs to be applied to this budget and to the 2013 budget, because last year, we warned you that we were not going to be able to afford to fund the policies chosen and commitments made and, unfortunately, we were right: for example, there are currently programmes in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research on hold due to a lack of funding.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore call on the Council to put a stop now to this policy of cuts and genuinely to provide the money for financing the mandate of the Commission and the European Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, the draft budget for 2013 includes funding of almost EUR 150 billion for commitments alone. These commitments are directly related to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and they have increased by 2.7% to EUR 64.5 billion in total. The figures under Heading 1, sustainable growth, in particular, have risen by 3.5%.</p>
      <p sl="de">The central programmes for growth and investment, small and medium-sized businesses, employment and young people and new initiatives, for example, the planned pilot phase for the project bond initiative in the fields of transport, energy and ICT, should help to resolve liquidity problems and, therefore, to promote investment and growth, which Europe currently needs more urgently than ever.</p>
      <p sl="de">The payments in the draft budget amount to a total of EUR 138 billion. In the last year of the current financial framework, the draft budget includes higher funding for payments than in 2012, in particular, in the Seventh Framework Programme, where the increase is around 28%, and in the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, where the increase amounts to about 12%. These correspond exactly with the estimated payment applications from the public and private partners, which are responsible for projects in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">The proposed increase of 6.8% in the total payment appropriations is the result and the inevitable consequence of the EU’s commitments under the terms of the Treaties to enable all the larger programmes to continue and to take into account the outstanding commitment appropriations from the current year and from previous years. This is conscientious and responsible budgeting.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are also setting priorities, such as the programme for supporting ICT policy, which will be concentrating in 2013 on increasing the spread of these technologies and ensuring that they are used as effectively as possible, in line with Europe’s digital agenda. Overall, this programme will support Europe and the draft budget is a positive approach which we will hopefully be able to adopt together with the Council. Incidentally, if you will allow me to, I would like to conclude by saying that we would have saved a significant amount of money if we had held this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in the debate on the summit this morning, Mr Barroso said that the European budget is the decisive instrument for sustainable growth. I share his view and Mr Lewandowski has just made the same point. As things currently stand, it is important for us to emphasise once again that the way in which we debate the budget is part of the Community method. Parliament must decide together with the Council and only when we reach an agreement will there be a joint budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then the Council decided last week at the summit to mobilise an additional EUR 55 billion from the Structural Funds so that it could finally take measures to stimulate growth for the necessary consolidation policy in crucial areas, including education, research, sustainable energy and renewable energy, all of which are goals which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance share.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, what the Council failed to do was to explain where this money would come from at such short notice. I would like to endorse what the previous speakers have said. In political terms, the Council is totally schizophrenic. On the one hand, it calls for the growth pact and, on the other hand, it is not prepared to raise the payments for the budget either this year or in 2013. It is true that, following the reports from the Member States, the Commission’s estimates were cautious. However, they are based on the fact that we have to comply with the Treaties. Therefore, I and my group are calling on the Council and on the Cyprus Presidency to be brave in the negotiations, to take a bold European approach, and to ensure that the necessary payments are made. Otherwise, the Council’s decision will lead to us deceiving the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European economy faces challenges like never before, and it will principally be our ability to keep pace with the rest of the world that will determine the future for the European peoples.</p>
      <p sl="en">The budget will be the key to that future, and our most pressing priority ought to be improving competitiveness to support economic growth based on a fully functioning single market and greater value for money spent at European level. That means investing in research and development, investing in border infrastructure and investing in broadband connectivity – all things which will help people in their daily lives and in the future. But it also means that, in a strictly limited budget, we should only be spending where we can see clear value for money and relevance to the challenges of the day.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the time when we ought to be looking again at the traditional spending areas. It is a time when we ought to be asking the difficult questions. For example: has past investment in structural funding projects really brought the benefits that were intended? Will the reform proposals for the common agricultural policy really deliver measurable environmental benefits, and at what price to the European taxpayer? Against the backdrop of the current economic challenges, this budget is missing the opportunity to seek out those new approaches. Instead, the solution is more of the same: the same policies, but more money spent.</p>
      <p sl="en">This House would be mistaken if it was to presume that it could go on increasing spending at a time when the people of Europe are experiencing cutbacks and austerity. We should be leading by example, and that means freezing the size of the budget.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the only response of governments in Europe to the needs of their peoples has been austerity. We need a Europe of solidarity, not this Europe of punishment. Parliament is the only institution with direct democratic legitimacy. Exclusive authority over the EU budget cannot be handed over to governments. We already know their solution. We will therefore vote against this mandate. We have many serious disagreements with the majority in Parliament. For example, we will not support direct transfers to multinational drug companies or appropriations for a ‘Fortress Europe’. Instead, we will fight, tabling amendments to the budget so that it constitutes an effective response to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission proposes increasing the level of payments, but the reality is that these are already promised to the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund, whose main creditors are none other than Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal. Fewer resources will only result in fewer jobs, more poverty and more social exclusion. This is not the time for half-measures or vague decisions made by Europe’s leaders. It is time to change Europe, which, up until now, has been held hostage to the markets and banks. More than ever, this is the time to respond to the specific problems of real people, prioritising job creation, health, education and social security.</p>

Hundreds of billions have been spent to date that have added up to precisely nothing in terms of growth. Many believe, as I do, that the EU and its policies are, to a large extent, responsible for this crisis. The Commission, in particular, has failed to control the use of EU funding entrusted to it by the taxpayers, while targeting the funds towards supporting its own heavy regulation and the EU project as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now this House wants to reward this failure with an increase. If you are listening, Mr Cameron, I have a straight-talking message for you: continue to send money to Brussels and you are effectively transferring power to an unelected, irresponsible and hugely wasteful bureaucracy.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Europe is undergoing a long-term structural, financial and economic crisis, which is accompanied by constantly rising levels of youth unemployment. This has led to an explosive social situation in which all the social structures from the family to state systems have been pushed to their limits. It is affecting an entire generation of people in the EU and it needs a quick political response.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this background, the draft budget for 2013 is a positive and consistent reaction by Parliament, because stringent cuts have been made which even involve the staff of EU institutions. Austerity in the institutions and at all levels of political activity, together with a combined focus on growth and stimulating growth in the future, are what is needed, firstly, in order to increase the citizens’ confidence in the ability of politicians and the EU to act and, secondly, to create new jobs, so that young people, in particular, have prospects for the future.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me congratulate the rapporteur. We could hear it from the previous speech: he does not have an easy job. The 2013 budget must contribute to the resolution of Europe’s problems. Perhaps all of us agree that one of the most serious of these problems is unemployment, and linked to that the decline in production. There are, by the way, some who see the dismal state of banks as the heart of the problem, and focus on the decrease in lending; however, amidst several unsuccessful attempts at consolidating banks, as well as the various banking scandals that erupted recently, the European people would not accept it if we were to find a solution in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Headings 1a and 1b of the European budget, on the other hand, include several programmes that are suitable for both job creation and increasing production. The effectiveness of these programmes could even be enhanced if Member States took a flexible approach and, instead of clinging to the implementation of their pre-crisis programmes, made reallocations. In order to be able to make better use of the opportunities provided by the 2013 budget, Member States should not hesitate to give preference to programmes that support production and job creation. Meanwhile, the European Commission should react more rapidly to support such proposals. This would constitute real crisis management. If we continue to dream about unspent funds and then create new plans for using them, all we will see is the mountain going into labour and giving birth to a little grey mouse; or maybe not even that. Instead of the myth of unspent monies, the budgetary authority should face the fact that payment needs grow in the final year of the cycle, and the costs associated with all those programmes will need to be paid.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the hope that this will help us to find such a solution, I suggest that we grant this mandate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would also like to thank Mr La Via for his excellent report. I speak as the rapporteur for the other sections’ budget under Heading 5. First of all, I will say just a few words on Parliament’s own budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues will recall the letter from the Commissioner urging all institutions to keep their increase next year to below 1.9%. Colleagues will also recall that in our estimates, we said we would aim for an increase of 1.9% for the moment. I say ‘for the moment’ because what we have done as a Parliament is to put in place a working group to look at making savings in Parliament’s budget. Currently, the working group is looking at such things as travel costs for Members and for staff on missions, and we are looking at a comparable study with other Member States and the US Congress as well. By September of this year, I think we will be able to recommend some savings in Parliament’s budget and by the end of the year, we will have a full report available as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to say a few words on the budgets of other institutions. The Commission originally proposed an increase in their budget of 3.2%. I understand that the Council will be proposing an increase of around 1.8%, which is, of course, very close to the 1.9% originally suggested by the Commissioner. I think we need to look at all the institutions individually, however. We know, for example, that the Court of Justice and the External Action Service are already saying that they will need a much bigger increase. But I think that, in general, we should go for an increase of around 1.9%, if not lower. Then we can say – and the other institutions can say – that as a Parliament, we have had a cut in real terms in the administrative budget of our institutions. I think that would be a good thing for this Parliament and for the other institutions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, we are now debating, as we do every year, a mandate for the budget trialogue that is supposed to bring us a budget for the following year. As in previous years, I would like to make a call for common sense and support the effort to reach a compromise but, on the other hand, I am against Parliament needlessly adding fuel to the fire and issuing unrealistic demands.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The economic situation in the EU continues to be very difficult, and it will be no different next year. For this reason, it is not possible to force Member States to increase expenditure radically. In my opinion, Parliament should, in the first place, try to adopt next year’s budget in a timely and proper manner, so that we can avoid delays and provisional arrangements. I believe that this is our key concern, as any budget disputes over trivial matters would put at risk the economic situation across the entire EU, and we cannot allow that.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to say that next year, the EU will, for the first time, achieve fairness in direct payments for farmers in the new Member States, which, as a politician from a new Member State, I very much welcome. In my opinion, this is a historic moment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we said in Parliament in March that it is a top priority to support growth in employment in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy. My views on this are similar, particularly when it comes to support for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector and for young people. The draft budget submitted by the Commission is in sympathy with this position and, from this point of view, it is satisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to remember that the EU budget is an extremely effective and practical instrument of investment, which is, particularly at the present time, very much needed for stimulating economic growth and creating jobs in all the Member States. This is why I am going to support this budget, as it is heading in the right direction, and, in particular, because it resists proposals to reduce funding for a policy which is helping to increase employment. I do not like the fact that in the current situation, there is to be a reduction in funding for a number of purposes, including the Progress programme, which was meant to help reduce unemployment, particularly among young people, to promote equality between women and men and to advance the fight against discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Planning the budget means planning our future. If we plan it so as to give people – young people, who are the most creative – the tools to help them develop, become independent, find work and change their lives, it will help us all to overcome the crisis on the basis of instead of giving the needy fish, giving them a fishing rod.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Union budget is the most important expression of solidarity towards all the 27 Member States of the European Union and also between those Member States. The EU budget is more than an instrument with which to even out differences in the level of prosperity between inhabitants of European regions. First and foremost, it is a means of stimulating investment and competitiveness and creating jobs in the European Union. We do have ideas on how to stimulate economic growth across the EU. The instruments already exist, for example, the Structural Funds, the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) and the Lifelong Learning Programme. Implementation of these instruments does more than help the beneficiaries of these programmes. It also enables the entire European Union to meet the challenges of the 21st century, especially in relation to global competitiveness as well as job maintenance and creation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore believe that in next year’s budget, we should guarantee an appropriate level of expenditure, first and foremost, to allow past commitments to be met, while also supporting the process of economic recovery. As for details, I would like to emphasise that we must not allow the growing discrepancy between commitments and payments in the EU budget to worsen any further. This discrepancy, in my opinion, would be an expression of the European Union’s inability to meet commitments entered into previously. The 6.8% increase in payment appropriations in comparison to 2012 is, in my view, a minimum which should be accepted both by the Council and the European Parliament. We cannot focus exclusively on resolving the current situation, or on superficial and hasty solutions. We have to consider the future long-term development of the European Union, something I feel we are called upon to do.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would like to highlight four points. We would be pleased to see SMEs not cutting back on their investments; on the contrary, this field should be reinforced, for example, through support from the EIB. We would be pleased if the experiments and initiatives concerning project bonds were implemented and became successful, and could afterwards be available for similar infrastructural projects in information technology. Commissioner, we wish to very strongly emphasise that although we welcome the ITER project, we believe that it should be financed in such a way as to not hinder the successful implementation of other EU policies, in particular, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research. We managed to solve this last year, and I hope that a solution will be found this year as well. Lastly, I would like to stress that the SET Plan has yet to receive the budgetary allocations vital for its implementation. I believe that if we can make progress in these four areas then, Commissioner, we can smile at each other.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic situation in Europe is bad, as we know. Member States are being called upon to make huge cuts, which also means painful sacrifices in society’s key functions, such as defence, education and health care.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At such times, we cannot look as if we are an institution detached from the everyday realities of ordinary people. Making savings, or at least keeping appropriations at the level of inflation, must be something that applies to us too. If we now ask for unreasonable increases in our budget, we will not just be without funds, but we will be harming our reputation and presenting an image of indifference.</p>
      <p sl="fi">What is good about the report is the decision to examine overlap in the financing of actions by the EU, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other. The EU does not need to do anything that the Member States can do by themselves.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, today, I would like to focus, in particular, on the subject of the agencies. I have noticed that there is no specific focus on financing for the agencies in 2013 or in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="de">To give you a few examples, there are the new supervisory agencies: the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). If these agencies are to do justice to the job which we were discussing once again at the weekend, then they need to be equipped to do it properly, because otherwise, we will ultimately not be able to implement all the plans that we have put in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another example is Europol. Europol manages its budget very carefully. In 2011, it had particularly high levels of transfers because some programmes had begun later. The fact that Europol is now being punished with a 10% reduction and is supposed to establish a cybercrime centre with its current funding is simply impossible. We need to ensure that the agencies are properly financed and, at the same time, we need to monitor the management board structures, because I believe that the large number of members on the boards sometimes means that the agencies are managed less efficiently.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union budget that we are proposing for 2013 has been increased by 6.8% in comparison to 2012 in terms of payment appropriations, amounting to around EUR 138 billion. I hope that this increase is enough to deal with the commitments taken on by the European Union, where I would highlight the investments that each Member State is making, particularly in terms of cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I recall that at the end of 2011, the Commission was unable to reimburse around EUR 11 billion, so EUR 11 billion in legitimate payment claims was left owing, due to the insufficient level of appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This occurred because of the Council, which stubbornly acted against its own interests. I call on the Council to act rigorously and realistically, so as not to prevent the payment of amounts which are already contracted, are already allocated and which are important to guarantee economic growth and employment and, at the same time, to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion. Finally, like the rapporteur, whom I congratulate for the excellent work carried out, I advocate the promotion of growth and jobs, support for small and medium-sized enterprises and young people, and investment in smart, sustainable and inclusive growth as priorities for the 2013 budget.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, the EU budget should constitute an instrument for investment and solidarity. It should be a measure to stimulate economic growth and revival. In my opinion, therefore, reducing expenditure, in particular, expenditure allocated to the implementation of policies delivering growth and employment, is detrimental to the European economy. It should be stressed that many Member States also increased their budgets in 2012, in order to combat the effects of the crisis. Moreover, I am concerned about the ever growing level of outstanding commitments (RAL). This is a result of decisions taken to reduce payments in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure. The planned accumulated payments expected in 2013 may also intensify budgetary difficulties. A reduction in payment appropriations represents a serious threat to the implementation of cohesion policy, which should play a key role in economic revival and enable the EU to get back on track towards growth.</p>

We are at the end of the seven-year period and now we are faced with a number of payments that we have to make, in addition to those from previous years, especially for cohesion policy. It is crazy that the money should flow back to Member States, to net contributors, in the early years. And then they refuse to pay the bills. Should we not just set one off against the other?

      <p sl="sk">Member States must increasingly retrench and simultaneously invest in the development of their economies.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank the Members for their comments. I see that it is very fashionable now to compare national budgets with the European budget and this is partly justified, but only partly, as there is no full analogy for several reasons.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European budget is always in equilibrium: no deficit, no indebtedness. This is because of its size: our budget is 1% of gross national income (GNI) but it is not comparable to the 4% or 5% of GNI spent already on assisting the financial institutions of the European Union and this is not the reason for the trillions of debt accumulated in the Member States. However, it might be part of the solution of how to enhance, in a responsible way, growth and jobs opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">If there is an analogy, it lies in our efforts to save whatever can be saved. This will be in administration because, for the first time since the beginning of the European Community, in 2013 the number of EU officials is going to be reduced, no longer growing. This also concerns agency staff – I am saying this for Ms Hohlmeier’s sake. Are there performance savings? Yes: if we need adjustments, for example, in the development cooperation instruments in Latin America and Asia where some programmes are not performing, then we are making savings and this is clearly reflected in the draft budget for 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taken altogether, our spending is now EUR 66 billion, less than agreed for the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013. This is the net result of performance savings and being restrained in budgeting in the European Union. But what is the budget?</p>
      <p sl="en">This is about the means to cover legitimate bills, bills coming for approved projects in the Member States. Ninety-four percent of the budget goes outside Brussels; only 6% concerns administration. What is the result when we delay or do not pay? That is the problem of reimbursements to the finance ministries: this means deteriorating liquidity in Member States, or really reducing investment possibilities in the Member States or not supplying the means to overcome the credit crunch for small and medium-sized companies. And the net result, the final result, is the mountain of unpaid commitments. That is about the future bills; no real solution. This is not a real option.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2013 budget was built on the deliveries coming from the Member States and I agree with Alain Lamassoure that it is perhaps a little bit schizophrenic to send the bills to Brussels. We evaluate very critically and then we make an effort to respect the deals and we cannot be criticised for respecting the bills coming from 27 countries. This is a little bit of a schizophrenic approach to the budget. I do not think that anybody is surprised that with the 2013 budget, which is the last, we have additional requests for payments. But it is a practical test of what was called the ‘growth agenda of the European Union’, done in a fiscally responsible way.</p>

It is undeniable that today, with outstanding commitments or reste-à-liquider (RALs) that have now reached EUR 207 million, there is now a mountain of bills to pay, accounts that are obviously legitimate because they arise from commitments lawfully made in previous years and which must now be honoured.</p>
      <p sl="it">First and foremost, the need for payment focuses on those headings that are most closely related to development, to economic growth. This is why we have to fight the battle for payments, and Parliament, with this mandate for the trialogue, clearly gives an indication in this regard. We called for interinstitutional collaboration, as it is clear that without a common starting point in terms of information, we can and probably will reach different conclusions. We already had that experience during conciliation last year and we started from different assessments. We must monitor payments and, in this respect, we are calling upon what is today an empty chair, that of the Council, but through our mandate for the trialogue, we call upon the Council to take part in our interinstitutional dialogue so that by the end of our talks, when we discuss and settle the 2013 budget, we will have reached a joint vision of the real needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I would like to thank Commissioner Lewandowski for his sincere cooperation and the groups that tomorrow will give their support to this mandate for the trialogue, which I hope will pass by a large majority in order to give us the bargaining strength in the discussions that we will be holding next week with the other institutions.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question submitted by Vital Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, and by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to the Commission on the EU-Israel agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (CAA); additional protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement (O-000129/2012 - B7-0119/2012).</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I myself submitted this oral question, as Chair of the Committee on International Trade and as rapporteur for this procedure for consent to an international agreement. It concerns a protocol on assessing the conformity and acceptance of industrial products between the European Union and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Two substantive issues have been raised regarding this agreement. One was raised in the Committee on International Trade regarding political consistency or congruency. The European Union condemns without qualification Israeli policy towards the occupied territories and towards the peace process, on the one hand, yet is willing to upgrade the status of EU-Israel trade relations, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second problem – which is the one under discussion now, not the first one – was raised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs when the Committee on International Trade asked for its opinion on the issue of political consistency. The Committee on Foreign Affairs raised this issue: the agreement does not clearly specify the territorial scope of its implementation. What it literally says is that products imported from Israel covered by this protocol, in particular, pharmaceutical products, will enter the EU internal market without requiring a conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products within the EU, since they have been certified by the competent Israeli authorities, which is the very subject of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The issue raised is about knowing whether this can be applied to products not made in Israel’s legal territory, according to the European Union’s understanding that it does not include the occupied territories, or if it excludes all products from these territories. The problem was raised in relation to Article 9 of the protocol, which establishes the existence of authorities on the side of Israel responsible for ensuring this conformity assessment and the acceptance of products exported by Israel to the European Union. They thus benefit from this system of bilateral recognition of reciprocal procedures. Therefore, the issue raised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which the Committee on International Trade seconded – meaning that the question is being asked by both committee chairs – comprises four or five questions. I, personally, will focus on the first two.</p>
      <p sl="pt">First, can the Commission ensure, in a legally binding way, that it will not accept, tacitly or otherwise, the territorial jurisdiction of the responsible Israeli authority mentioned in Article 9 of the Protocol including territories under Israeli administration since 1967? The second question, which is related, is can the Commission ensure that no industrial products manufactured in the settlements, in the Israeli occupied territories, in the West Bank settlements or in Eastern Jerusalem will be certified under this protocol?</p>
      <p sl="pt">A clear response to these two questions is essential because it is about knowing the territorial scope of the agreement and understanding this protocol, whose drafting and negotiation was clearly flawed, because this issue obviously must have come up. It is also obvious that the European Union cannot accept that products originating in the occupied territories might benefit from this arrangement with the Israeli authorities. Either the Commission has a unilateral interpretation that clarifies to Parliament that the protocol is applicable only to Israel’s legal territory as the EU understands it, or we have a problem which may influence the decisions of Members comprising the Committee on International Trade, which is the competent committee in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We consider it in the committee’s best interests to give a clear, binding response that the EU will first … I am concluding, Mr President … that the Commission will ask for the necessary elements to guarantee that the competent Israeli authority does not have jurisdiction beyond legal Israeli territory and that the protocol cannot be interpreted in any way other than being limited to Israel’s legal territory.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse what Mr Moreira has said and, therefore, I do not need to repeat the majority of it. The Committee on Foreign Affairs believes that the agreement is sensible and that it should be brought into force once we have positive answers to certain questions. We also consider the provision in the agreement which specifies that essential products should be tested before they are delivered and certified and that this should be followed by mutual recognition to be sensible. This will save a great deal of money and increase the competitiveness of both sides. Therefore, we should support this provision.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I have said, if certain questions are answered, we will recommend that the Committee on International Trade proposes a vote in plenary on the agreement. Mr Moreira’s questions concern the territorial scope of the agreement and the meaning of Article 9 of the protocol. Does it apply to territories outside the 1967 borders? Are products from the West Bank or East Jerusalem covered by this protocol for the purposes of certification if they come from the settlements? Do products manufactured by Palestinians have the same opportunities for certification and, therefore, are they not being put at a disadvantage in trade terms?</p>
      <p sl="de">We would like an answer to these questions. There are doubts as to whether this has been resolved from a legal perspective. Parliament’s Legal Service has said that this could be explained unilaterally by the Commission. That would resolve the matter for us. There is also the question of whether this is technically feasible and whether it really is possible to carry out foolproof checks that this has taken place. Mr De Gucht, I have said all that I want to say.</p>

    <intervention id="2-574-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Karel De Gucht" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to clarify outstanding issues regarding the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance (ACAA) between Israel and the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by recalling what an ACAA is about. Its objective is to eliminate barriers to trade, through allowing products covered by the agreement to enter the markets of the parties without additional conformity assessment procedures, resulting in mutual recognition of conformity assessment and inspection results, which will reduce costs and time for economic operators.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is typically a response to technical barriers to trade. The Commission considers that the current ACAA text is compliant with the Lisbon Treaty and international law and that no change or renegotiation is necessary. The Commission would like to provide the following assurances to the Parliament:</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the ACAA is a Protocol to the EU-Israel association agreement. Therefore, while not defining it, its scope of application is the same as set out in Article 83 of the association agreement. As it results from international obligations of the EU and as confirmed by the European Court of Justice in 2010 in the Brita case, the EU does not recognise Israeli jurisdiction over the territories placed under Israeli administration after 1967. The Commission will observe this position in the implementation of the ACAA.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, when the agreement enters into force, the Commission will have to acknowledge under Article 9 of the ACAA the responsible Israeli authority which will have to deliver conformity certificates. This acknowledgement will not entail any recognition of Israeli jurisdiction over territories placed under Israeli administration after 1967.</p>
      <p sl="en">You can also rest assured that, upon receipt of the Israeli notification of its responsible authority, the Commission will expressly state that acknowledgement is granted only on the basis that the territory covered by the responsible authority does not include the territories brought under Israeli administration in 1967.</p>
      <p sl="en">Separately, I would like to recall that the ACAAs are not based on the product origin but on mutual trust in the quality of the certification and inspection bodies. ACAAs recognise that certifiers in third countries certify industrial products in the same way as in EU Member States. In practice, the EU will recognise whatever product is certified by Israel, whatever its origin, Israeli or not.</p>
      <p sl="en">For practical reasons, and for reasons of compliance with WTO’s non-discrimination rules, these agreements cannot discriminate or exclude on the basis of origin. This is also in line with the EU acquis .</p>
      <p sl="en">These rules also apply under the ACAA to the Israeli Responsible Authority, which could – under certain conditions – certify not only Israeli products but also those from third countries once the ACAA is in force. In the same vein, Israeli and EU Member State Responsible Authorities could also certify products from the occupied territories.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as stated before, this does not and cannot imply any recognition of Israel’s jurisdiction over these territories. According to information received from Israeli authorities and NGOs, there is currently no pharmaceutical production in Israeli settlements. Therefore, Israel cannot discriminate against Palestinian products in the certification process because Israel will have to apply the EU acquis .</p>
      <p sl="en">Like any EU Member State, Israel must carry out inspections irrespective of the origin of the product when a request is received. If there were cases of discrimination, the Palestinian manufacturer could lodge a complaint with the Israeli judicial authorities. Of course, the Commission could also use existing means under the association agreement to ensure that Israel implements the ACAA.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the 2005 Technical Arrangement which allows the EU to identify and deny preferential treatment under the association agreement to goods produced in areas beyond Israel’s pre-1967 borders, it must be recalled that preferential treatment in terms of customs tariffs is an entirely different issue to conformity assessment and that the origin of the product fully keeps its relevance when the certified product is to enter the territory of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been cases of abuse, which have been detected and tackled appropriately, but they are few and insignificant in volume of trade. The Commission is presently working on a modification of the system, including the publication of a list of settlement codes, which will increase awareness of EU importers and will allow customs authorities to verify these declarations more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Foreign Affairs Council, on 14 May, held a substantive discussion on the Middle East peace process and agreed, inter alia , that the EU will assess whether existing legislation, in particular, in the area of labelling, is being fully and effectively implemented.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr De Gucht, I would like to thank you very much for your very clear statement. I think that from my point of view, you have answered the questions which were causing us concern.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, I would be pleased if we could finally make some progress with this dossier. It is only an additional protocol to an association agreement and it has spent a long time in Parliament. I very much doubt whether the length of time is appropriate given the actual content. We were supposed to be considering this dossier at the same time as a trade agreement with the Palestinian territories. I very much regret the fact that we often have double standards in this House. On the one hand, we have rightly applied considerable pressure and have said that we want the law to be complied with and our political requirements to be met. However, months ago, we adopted the agreement with the Palestinian territories with a broad majority here in Parliament, despite the fact that they are still imposing the death penalty and other similar matters. I want to make it very clear that I would like to see a much more logical approach to voting and debating among the groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, Mr De Gucht, and, after the intense debate this afternoon, this is genuinely not meant seriously, there is only one thing which could prevent us voting in favour of this agreement. Therefore, I would like to ask you whether you can assure us that this additional protocol will not lead to Internet service providers being forced to monitor data, the introduction of the ‘three-strikes’ policy through the back door or other restrictions on freedom of speech on the Internet or in Romania. I would be very grateful if you could turn your attention to this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I really appreciate the clarifications you have given us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that you have tried to answer our questions very seriously and I was about to ask you whether the Commission is committed to rejecting, under Article 9 of the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance (ACAA), the appointment of an Israeli authority that would not exclude settlements within its jurisdiction. I think that you have answered my question and that you will be very vigilant with regard to the appointment of this authority. I want to believe you on this issue and on others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I still have two regrets, or rather one concern and one source of bitterness. The first concern relates to control mechanisms. If we, in Parliament, show our agreement with the ACAA, how will we be kept informed about the various controls that the Commission will surely put in place and how will we be able to verify them? I have no answer on this subject, but this question will undoubtedly be back on the table in good time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second thing is a source of bitterness, and of anger. I share Mr Moreira’s opinion and I find that, on this issue, which is, of course, a pharmaceutical issue for the time being, the question of human rights, the question of political context, has not been raised, or at least it has not been raised here. It is a major issue nonetheless. This famous human rights clause, which features in our trade agreements, are we sure that it is being upheld today? I will admit that I have lost this battle and I will accept that. I will not mention it again. I am very aware of the agreements that I have made with Mr Brok on this matter and I will vote as needs be. However, I find it mind-boggling and insane that in this Parliament, people can be concerned about what is happening with regard to the expansion of settlements and, at the same time, not be concerned in the slightest with voting for a trade agreement which will, of course, have many advantages for us, as it will for Israel, but which, I fear, will do nothing for the Palestinians.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today we are discussing the oral question that seeks to clarify in a binding way appropriate measures to ensure that the EU will not import medicines or other pharmaceutical products from the occupied territories. This is in line with our policies across all imports from Israel, as well as exports. It is now both what Israel and Commissioner De Gucht have said, so it should also apply to these products in the wake of this protocol.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we talk about the technical implementation of a protocol to a trade agreement, some context and background are important, as it is undeniable that the political discussions have taken the upper hand in this House when dealing with this dossier. When it comes to Israel or the Middle East peace process, we have to be careful not to be so divisive ourselves that we become part of the problem instead of the solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Clearly, the EU has a responsibility to lead in protecting and promoting universal human rights worldwide. We believe trade agreements are an important lever and I think we should not shy away from firmly invoking conditionality clauses, especially those on human rights. However, to appropriately address the serious problem of the illegal settlements that the current government of Israel continues to build, this may not be the tool. We either have to use the conditionality at association agreement level or find other ways. To start with, this protocol means we are turning procedures upside down and that will have an adverse effect. If nothing else, the procedural journey that this protocol has made through the EU makes us all less credible, and that is not what we need. Instead, trade and human rights should align in the EU’s external actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ALDE Group hopes the answer to this oral question will provide clarity so that we can put the protocol to a vote. It is then up to Members of this House to vote according to their conscience, as we always do, even on difficult and politicised issues. However, with or without this protocol, I once again urge the Israeli Government to stop the illegal settlements and to move closer to the EU and the international community. Getting by on a day-by-day basis is not the same as a sustainable two-state solution, which moves further away with every settlement built. That is irresponsible towards Israeli citizens in a dramatically uncertain and changing neighbourhood.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that in several Member States, including France, it is consumer associations and human rights organisations which carry out controls on the origin of products labelled ‘Made in Israel’, and these groups regularly denounce the presence on our markets of products originating in illegal settlements. It is not a rare occurrence. In a spirit of ethical consumption, civil society therefore tries to ensure the traceability of products imported from Israel, as the European Union has shown that it is incapable of implementing the 2005 technical agreement in accordance with international law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You will understand that I am very sceptical and dubious that you will give us guarantees, as you should, on legally binding provisions ensuring that no more products from the settlements are entering the European market.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group believes, with regard to the EU-Israel ACAA, that the concerns raised in the joint oral question from the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs are unfounded and confused, as this agreement is not about the territorial provenance of pharmaceutical products, but the right for competent Israeli authorities to certify medicines that they examine as being up to EU standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are already separate stringent EU-wide rules about goods arriving from the West Bank and Gaza and what EU tariffs should apply to them. ACAA is a purely technical agreement and has become a highly politicised one as part of an Israel-bashing exercise which does nothing to facilitate access to high-quality and affordable pharmaceutical products for our European consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ACAA has been delayed far too long in this Parliament and the Committee on International Trade should move swiftly to a vote on the agreement, thus facilitating a decision on Parliament’s assent at a future plenary vote, which should likewise take place without any further delay.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, it is high time that the European Union abided by its own commitments and undertakings. Under Article 2 of the association agreement, we must not improve trade relations with Israel while there is daily proof that it is guilty of human rights violations.</p>
      <p sl="el">Any such improvement both infringes the agreement and neutralises the only specific instrument at our disposal for putting pressure on Israel to honour its obligations in terms of human rights and humanitarian law, both inside Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are therefore against giving our consent to this agreement. The only condition on which the European Parliament could agree would be in return for satisfactory assurance that the EU will ban imports of Israeli goods from East Jerusalem and the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p sl="el">How will you ensure that products from the occupied Palestinian territories are not being imported into the European Union under false certificates of origin?

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are going from one heated debate, ACTA, to another heated debate, ACAA. Time and again, we have been postponing and obstructing the ACAA, using different filibusters and trying to do everything we cannot to do what we know is needed. The only consequence is that we are postponing something that would help patients in Europe, that would give more choice in terms of medicines, and that would deliver greater competition and lower prices, even though everybody here knows it is about standards and that there are no medicines produced in the occupied territories. So how could this question even be relevant in this context? Even if there were medicines produced there, you know that these standards should apply to Israeli-produced medicines and to imported medicines, no matter where they come from.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Israeli Government has a clear commitment to applying these standards. That is what it is all about. But sadly, this House has managed to hijack this question and make it into another part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the detriment of patients throughout Europe. That is a shame. Remember that we had an agreement and a debate on an agreement with Palestine – quite recently actually – and, at that time, we had the courage not to do what we are doing here. We judged it on its own merits and approved it. We should do the same thing right here and right now.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card question. – Mr Fjellner tells us that this is about medicines. At the moment, yes, and the occupied territories are not producing them at present. However, we all know that what we are being asked for in the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance (ACAA) is a certification framework, and that today, it is about medicines. Tomorrow, other items may be addressed for which Parliament will no longer be asked to give its consent. We therefore have to go further and it could apply to other products manufactured in the settlements. Is Mr Fjellner aware of that?</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Ms De Keyser, I am happy to hear that you have read the agreement and know that it is about medicines. But again, even though it is about medicines, you acknowledge the fact that there are no medicines produced there. If there were other products and other agreements, let us judge those products and agreements on their merits and not try to kidnap this and say we cannot do this even though we know it is right.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I could not disagree more with Christopher Fjellner on this subject. It may be a technical upgrade of the relationship with Israel but there is no doubt there is a highly politicised move at this time. Adopting the ACAA is entirely out of sync with the EU’s ambition for policy coherence between trade, human rights, development and foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tomorrow, we will vote on a resolution on EU policy in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Let us be coherent about how we tackle the suffering in the occupied territories and the increased trade benefits we give to Israel. We cannot turn a blind eye to the serious escalating human rights violations when we upgrade a trade agreement. More trade and easier trade should never be at the expense of upholding our commitments to human rights. The collective punishment of Gaza is unacceptable and until serious steps are taken by Israel to comply with international law, I strongly oppose this upgrade.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the Commission is able to give detailed answers on how the ACAA would function in practice and how we would ensure that products manufactured in the settlements do not fall under the scope of the protocol. I disagree with Christofer’s analysis that this is never going to happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">This clarification would help with the ACAA but, at the moment, even with that clarification, I strongly believe it would be wrong in terms of policy coherence to upgrade our relationship with Israel and I will continue to oppose the ACAA until the situation between Israel and the Palestinians improves.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there have been delays in dealing with this agreement in the Committee on International Trade (INTA), but there are many other very different kinds of delays on the ground with regard to improving the condition of the Palestinian population. This is a debate on how to prevent products from the settlements from benefiting from this agreement – this is a red line that cannot be crossed. I appreciate what the Commissioner has said, but it is also true that so far, we have not had any mechanisms that have worked.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also a debate on the political impact of this agreement, because I believe, indeed I fear, that its adoption would be interpreted as opening a credit line in favour of a government that does not give much credit, so to speak, to questions from the European Union. No tangible progress in the resumption of negotiations, much less on the continued expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem, much less with regard – apart from some modest progress – to the Gaza blockade.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, the treatment of this dossier is more than technical; it is a highly political dossier, not a trivial one, and we call upon the Commission to assess how a trade policy measure can, as is normal in this context, become a foreign policy act on the ground.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it seems that every aspect of trade relations with Israel is used by some as an opportunity, directly or indirectly, to attack the State of Israel. How much better to recognise that here is a country of nearly eight million people with a standard of living higher than many EU Member States. It has turned desert into productive agricultural land, led the way on desalination technologies, and is home to a phenomenal number of start-up companies and a vibrant democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">What a contrast to those around. How much the Palestinians could learn and benefit from this if they were given the opportunity by their own leaders, if they recognised the right of Israel to exist, ended terrorism and hostility and moved forward in a positive spirit with negotiation of a two-state solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those seeking to pick holes in the EU-Israel ACAA protocol should ask themselves a simple question: do we want to bring about peace and prosperity for Palestinians or do we wish to condemn another generation to a life of poverty, hardship and insecurity?</p>
      <p sl="en">On the specific matter in hand, EU policy is clear, namely, that occupied territory products cannot benefit from preferential treatment under the technical arrangement and the EU-Israel association agreement. However, as the Commission itself has said, cases of abuse are neither numerous nor significant. There is no case for changing the technical arrangements and the ACAA protocol should be supported unhindered.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, today we have a technical protocol before us, but we have said many times that international trade is not just about economic and commercial considerations. If we look at our own European Convention, we see that the action of the European Union rests on the pervasiveness of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms and compliance with the principles of the UN Charter and international law. The relationship between Israel and the EU, and the association agreement between them, must also be tested against all of that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With today’s protocol, we need to be 100% certain that the provisions of the protocol do not apply to goods or products produced in the occupied territories, because that is politics. We need to ask ourselves what signal we would be sending out if we simply accepted this protocol without questioning it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Because, unfortunately – and this is down to politics – the comprehensive peace agreement that we all want will not come about through the settlements issue. A debate on a protocol such as the one we are having today provides the European Union with several levers to ensure that the parties come closer to each other. Mr President, I will be voting in favour tomorrow, but I will be doing so with the proviso that the protocol is properly supervised by the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his clarifications today, which are useful. There are the legal issues that have been raised, and you have attempted to answer some of those, Commissioner. Then there are political and indeed – as some colleagues have said and I agree with them – policy coherence issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the one hand, we have the legal issues. Does the Commission consider that it has the legal authority to reject or geographically restrict the territorial scope of the agreement? What binding assurances can the Commission give Parliament that it will not accept, tacitly or otherwise, that the territorial competence of Israeli authorities covers the Palestinian Territories? There are widespread reports of circumvention of current rules governing control of Israeli settlement goods, so can the Commission clarify whether it intends to review or reinforce this, or how this ACAA should be monitored?</p>
      <p sl="en">But, at the same time, as the Commission provides the legal clarifications, I have to ask myself, irrespective of the legal arguments, is it coherent or credible for the EU to consistently and forcefully criticise the Israeli authorities? We had the motion with the oral question last month, we have the resolution that we will be voting on tomorrow, so is it coherent to pass these resolutions, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to enhance our trade relationship through ratifying ACAA which – while I accept it is not technically an upgrading, given that it is based on the existing association agreement – in practice, does allow access for Israeli pharmaceuticals to one of the most lucrative markets in the world? I think that we have to take all of those issues into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I also thank Commissioner De Gucht for his very clear answers, though they only confirmed what we already knew. It is time to get on and vote on this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two years of discussion in committee has been a delaying tactic. As Commissioner De Gucht said, the objective of the ACAA is to eliminate barriers to trade by reducing costs and delays. I am rather astonished that many on the Committee on International Trade want to constrain trade and keep up costs. You are doing consumers and patients no favours on choice and price of medicines.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that, if there are Palestinian pharmaceutical products, they will also benefit from easier export to the EU under this protocol. On the question of trade and human rights, I have no hesitation whatsoever in criticising settlements or administrative detention by Israel or the many human rights breaches by the two Palestinian administrations. Trade is not at the expense of human rights. I have to say, as Vice-Chair of the US delegation, that has never stopped me criticising human rights problems like rendition in Guantánamo in the United States and it will not stop me on Israel either.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is yet another trade agreement that has become a hostage to a political situation in a country which is a partner of the European Union. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is actually far older than the history of the independent State of Israel. If we believe that the European Union can use this agreement as a means of positively influencing the development of Israeli-Palestinian relations, we are either mistaken or guilty of great arrogance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This conflict remains unresolved and highly inflammatory because of policies on both sides, namely, the Palestinian authorities (not ordinary Palestinians, of course), and also Israel. I refer to settlements we do not recognise which are being established on the occupied territories. I have to admit that this is an enormous problem for those who, like myself, wish the state of Israel well, are mindful of the importance of this place, this country, this democracy which is developing exceptionally well in the Middle East, and who are also conscious of the enormous danger it faces.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nevertheless, I would expect all those who criticise the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA) to put forward instead a grand, comprehensive plan, which we, as the European Union could – together with the United States – present to both sides to encourage them to talk. Clearly, the ACAA is not such a plan, but our failure to adopt it solely and exclusively to punish the State of Israel will ultimately penalise Europeans. European citizens will not be able to benefit from good, high-quality and inexpensive generic medicines, which are produced in Israel and not in the occupied territories. I therefore call upon everyone to vote in favour of the ACAA.</p>

      <p sl="es">We are dealing with a protocol to an agreement to align the legislative system of Israeli and EU infrastructure, but we need some clarifications and I would like to ask two questions. Firstly, are the Palestinian occupied territories part of the Israeli national market? Secondly, why is there not a human rights clause in this agreement?</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to product quality control and particularly in terms of the strict requirements concerning drugs, we are not against generic drugs. Quite the contrary, we think they are much more accessible, but we want guarantees. We want quality to be a requirement.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank Commissioner De Gucht for his substantial answer, which clarifies the concerns raised by the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I believe it is a step forward to make Parliament and the International Trade Committee ready for their final decisions on this issue and to give European patients access to high-quality pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know that this protocol has been under consideration in the European Parliament for more than two years. I hope two years is more than enough to discuss in depth, to scrutinise all possible aspects of this agreement, and to verify benefits and risks to European markets and European citizens. I am sure that it is time to give a green light to the implementation of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has been rightly pointed out today by Commissioner De Gucht, this protocol is part of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, which came into force in 1995, establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States and the State of Israel. Its Protocol 5 defines measures and rules on mutual assistance between administrative authorities on customs matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to mention today that there are instruments in place to detect cases of abuse. These instruments are legally binding and have been used in the past. The Commission proposed additional improvements and measures to be applied in order to strengthen customs procedures and verify conformity requirements and country of origin declarations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that legal measures are sufficient. They are functional and they are transparent. I believe that the International Trade Committee should move to a vote on the agreement without delay, facilitating a decision on consent to this agreement to be voted on in the plenary session following our summer recess.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while we appreciate the care with which they were formulated, your answers only partly give us peace of mind. We are facing a highly political issue, not just a commercial one: formal consistency between this agreement and the more general association agreement with Israel cannot justify the sort of subterfuge that facilitates infringing the prohibition that international law has imposed on Israel regarding products made in the occupied territories.</p>
      <p sl="it">I understand our economic interests, I also understand the technical scope of this protocol, but I believe the European Union should undertake a careful review of the origin of the products, because no protocol or agreement can ignore the more general context which prevails today. The repeated violations on this point by Israel do not help the process of détente which we all feel is required and which needs the European Union to be an active part of the solution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been in this Parliament for 23 years, and each time the issue of Israel is debated, out come gut reactions rather than technical, concrete debates. Parliament is stuck regarding ideological and political conflicts between those who are for or against Israel which, being matters not falling within the scope of the agreement being debated, unnecessarily hold up negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The opportunity for Israeli businesses to manipulate the protocol agreement in order to export goods to the occupied territories is offset by the possibility of sending back such products at EU borders under the so-called ‘technical agreement’, whereby the customs authorities of Member States may reject declarations of conformity for goods and products whose origins are in serious doubt.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is apart from the fact, incidentally, that if the Council had approved the regulation on the designation of origin, we would not be having this problem. I therefore hope the Committee on International Trade (INTA) will vote on this agreement as soon as possible and that the debate in the committee is more about reducing technical barriers to trade and will not continue to get bogged down in manipulating a non-existent problem. We must come and vote in plenary, because this agreement has been waiting too long to provide Europe and Israel with a document.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the debate today is extremely important; it goes beyond the concrete and entirely justified questions which have been posed to the Commission today in relation to the legal and constitutional concerns about ACAA. This debate is not a technical debate, it is a political debate, and the heart of the question again – which we come back to time and again on international trade agreements and related aspects here in Parliament – is whether the commitments in words to human rights by the European Parliament and the EU will last when faced with commercial interests of European big business and also, in this case, when faced with a political agenda of support for Israel.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fundamental for me is the point that we cannot go ahead with ACAA when there is a continuation of oppression of the Palestinians, an expansion of Israeli settlements and a continuation of the occupation. A number of MEPs argue in favour, because they say that EU patients would have access to a broader range of generic and branded medicines. That is extremely hypocritical in this case, given the conditions that I saw at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, which does not have 150 out of 450 essential medicines. When I was there, they did not have the necessary surgical gloves. We cannot go ahead with this agreement while those conditions prevail.</p>

In this context, I think that it was unjustified to delay the decision for a very long time. I hope that today’s debate will be the final chapter in this controversy, after which Parliament will finally give its consent. This is why I call on the Commission to provide all the clarifications requested by some of my colleagues, so that we can overcome the current deadlock.

      <p sl="en">I think the agreement is good and one which the EU and Israel need because it will facilitate the trade in medicines between the two countries with benefits in terms of health care for our patients. Many patients in the EU do not have access to proper treatment for diseases, especially those suffering from rare diseases. The agreement could change this situation, because Israel is one of the top innovators in the health care sector. Agreeing on the rules concerning the conformity assessment and acceptance of these products will facilitate the entry on the market of innovative treatments which our patients need. I therefore think that it is the right time to stop delaying the procedure and approve this agreement.</p>

From both sides, on the part of the Palestinians, but also on the part of large parts of the Arab world, an upgrade and recognition of ACAA will be seen as a reward. Those of us who have been to the area have heard this said very clearly so many times, and it was also said when Palestine’s foreign minister was here, so let us be open about it now. This will be a reward and it will be a case of ‘more for less’, because human rights are going backwards at the moment, and yet we are, in fact, giving Israel a better opportunity. I do not believe that anyone here – in response to those who say that we are only after Israel – would not want an Israel that lived in peace and democracy within recognised borders, borders recognised by both Israel and us, and with whom we would be pleased to trade.

Since then, we have had two and a half years of postponements, delays, questions, ping-pong matches, in other words, obstacles to the agreement, and that includes the latest questions put to you. No medicine is produced in the territories and everyone knows it. These are purely rhetorical questions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This parliamentary – we could even say buccaneering – obstruction is not worthy of our Parliament, which, less than an hour ago, was championing transparency on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), as we heard, calling for that same transparency from the Council, as it has done again this morning. Some people here are, in a non-transparent way and behind the scenes, waging a real war of shadows against the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance (ACAA). No matter what some people might think of this agreement, I do not believe that it is up to them to stop others from expressing their opinion on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I hope that your very specific and detailed answers will have reassured the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and our Parliament so that they can stop being held hostage on the matter and can finally, in good faith, express their true feelings on this issue, whether they are for or against.

They are not watertight, and all we can do is to do everything possible to monitor what we have been deciding so as to make sure that no products from the settlements come on to our markets. That is not only relevant to the ACAA, there are many other provisions and many other DGs that are implicated in this and what I will take upon myself is to have a coordination meeting of the different DGs and services so that we can in the future – probably, hopefully – better monitor what is really happening.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were many other questions, for example, on the fact that human rights provisions are not included in the ACAA. The same goes for many other provisions. It is a protocol to an existing association agreement, which means that anything that is provided for in the association agreement, for example, in respect to human rights, also, of course, applies to the protocols to that association agreement. You do not have to repeat them again in the protocol.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was also the question of whether we could provide you with the information in respect to monitoring. Whenever the European Parliament asks questions to the Commission, be they oral questions or written questions, we try to respond to them and we will, of course, do so. So if we get questions on the application of this protocol, we will try to give as fair an answer as possible and this does not, Ms De Keyser, only apply to the Trade Directorate-General; it applies to a number of other services like SANCO, TAXUD and others. So if you want us to give information, we will give the information we have. That will not necessarily be completely watertight because it is about putting into practice existing legislation and an existing protocol to an association agreement, but we will do so in good faith and it should be beyond doubt that the position of the European Union with respect to Israel is crystal clear: we do not recognise the settlements and Israel has an obligation of cooperation with respect to the occupied territories, for example, when it comes to this type of protocol.</p>

      <p sl="en">We, in this House, are split: some have placed the consumers from their countries at the centre of their attention and, consequently, want the ACAA approved, while others want to use ACAA as a ram against Israel’s settlements in the occupied territories, in an attempt to hit the Israeli Government.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barnier, on our agenda this week is a legislative own-initiative report on the subject of access to basic banking services. Parliament makes clear and detailed proposals from its perspective about what the Commission’s legislative initiative could and should look like.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first specific proposal concerns the schedule. A very large majority of the members of the main committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, believes that we should not waste any more time unnecessarily on this subject. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament by January 2013. I think that we are working along the same lines as Mr Barnier.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are of the opinion that the EU must make it possible for the 30 million citizens who have not yet had a bank account of their own to become part of the normal financial system. Without a bank account, things which the rest of us take for granted soon become insoluble problems. Renting a flat, signing a contract with an electricity supplier or joining the modern world of work are almost impossible in most countries unless you have a bank account. We believe that all of this should not be allowed to fail simply because the banks are aiming to maximise their profits. To quote the report: banks also have a responsibility for society. We will only have a functioning social market economy and a modern internal market when the banks genuinely take on this responsibility. However, let us be honest about the situation. Many citizens no longer trust the EU to achieve these goals. When it comes to the crunch, as it has in the current crisis, for the majority of citizens, these are just empty words. They know that the EU is supporting the banks with large rescue packages and many of them feel as if they have been left out in the cold. At least that is the impression that more and more citizens of more and more countries in the European Union have.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report which we will be voting on tomorrow was not originally planned as an own-initiative report. If the majority of the Commissioners had stuck to the Commission’s plan, today we would be able to present the citizens with the results of the negotiations. Work could already have begun on establishing the right of consumers throughout Europe to an account or these accounts could even be a reality already.</p>
      <p sl="de">We regard the recommendation that the Commission has sent to the Member States as disappointing. Many of the responses from the Member States to the request and to the Commission’s country reports are more akin to satire than to a sensible policy which is relevant to the citizens. In order to understand this, we need to remind ourselves of one thing. The question of access to bank accounts involves business interests, which is quite normal. These are interests which could hardly be more different as far as their opportunities for influence are concerned. Therefore, politicians must be responsible for ensuring a fair and socially desirable balance of interests. That is our job as politicians and as Members of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I cannot cover all the aspects of the report here. I simply want to highlight briefly what I believe are a few key points. One of these is cost. A basic account should be provided free of charge or at least at a reasonable charge. This is what the report says. In order to ensure that this is the case, the Member States should set a mandatory upper limit. The Commission should also investigate the possibility of an EU-wide upper limit for charges on a basic account, because we will not reach our target group without clear regulations on costs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Access is another important point. We must keep the bureaucratic obstacles to a minimum for consumers who rely on a basic account. Financial exclusion goes hand in hand with social exclusion. Another key point is subsidiarity. A directive would enable us to take the individual features of each country into account. We believe that the Member States would be best placed to define potential exceptions if as many of the banks as possible were covered by the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to give my sincere thanks to the members of the negotiating team, to the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also to Mr Barnier for our very effective and constructive collaboration. This definitely made a major contribution to the success of the report.</p>

    <intervention id="2-616-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, what Mr Klute has just said in the report that he is presenting to you is very important for the fair, humanist dimension of the internal market, which I have often mentioned to you, as it is proof of our shared hope, our shared ambition to bring citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) closer to this large market, even though they feel that this large market was not made for them, but that it was designed only for the big companies. That is why I have made consumer protection one of the priorities within our activities for this year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A short time ago, I presented, on behalf of the Commission, three texts which are focused in this direction on investor protection, small investors, savings products, financial products, insurance products and the responsibility of depositaries, three legislative texts which will come to your table and, this evening, we are talking about the same thing: this ambition to regain confidence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, it is not simply about the confidence of the markets, or the confidence of major financial institutions, or confidence in the price setting mechanism. Of course, those things are important, but today it has more to do with the confidence of citizens, of consumers, who have had many reasons to take issue with or grow tired of too many problems or crises, sometimes even cases of embezzlement in the past.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we talk about confidence, we are talking about the subject that Mr Klute mentions in his report, a subject which is in no way anecdotal: 30 million people in Europe, 7% of the Union’s adult population, do not have a bank account; of those, at least 20% have been deprived or have not dared ask to open or re-open a personal account. Consumers must have access to payment services in order to have their place and play their part in the large European market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I welcome your work and I thank you, Mr Klute. I would also like to thank Ms Gebhardt for her work within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) with several of your colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have, as you know, played the game of entering into dialogue and making agreements with the Member States. In the initial stages, which perhaps you found a little long – the consultation and reflection stage – this recommendation by the Commission was only followed partially, or to varying degrees, in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only a few of them have put into practice certain guidelines from our recommendation. 10 or so Member States have done nothing at all following the adoption of this text, and some have acted only partially. That is why your report, Mr Klute, comes at the right time to serve as a basis, a very good basis, for the legislative proposals that I will present to you subject to the agreement of the college in November, that is, in a few weeks’ time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to briefly mention some points that will guide our proposal. Firstly, guaranteed access for persons without a bank account. This is about the beneficiaries, of course, who are at the heart of the matter, that is, persons without access to payment services within a Member State, those who have been denied a bank account because of their social or financial situation, unemployment, debt or even because they are not residents in a Member State where they nonetheless need a bank account – I am thinking of students and seasonal workers. That is who we are talking about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to providers, should they all be required to offer basic accounts or should only some of them be required to do so? In that case, how do we determine which ones?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that, firstly, we have to study the practical aspects of the different solutions and look at national traditions because what matters here, above all, is that there is real access to basic payment accounts. Beyond that, we must establish quality standards for the content of basic accounts, as you said yourself, Mr Klute. I will not be satisfied with a cut-price basic payment account which does not enable users to carry out the simplest operations needed for day-to-day living. At the same time, we must ensure that we do not make disproportionate demands, but I do not want this basic bank account, which we are going to work on, to be a cut-price account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the issue of whether or not to include the possibility of an overdraft, I have no preconceived ideas. There are advantages and disadvantages and we are ready to work on the basis of the proposals that Mr Klute wanted to outline.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third subject is the principle of affordability. In some Member States, there are basic payment accounts which entail unlimited banking costs. Furthermore, we can see that the banks which offer basic payment accounts often do so at a higher price. Can we then consider affordability to be ensured? I suspect not. I believe in the virtue of a principle of reasonable affordability, which allows for real affordability, more so than a ceiling fixed around a precise, uniform amount.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The principle of reasonable cost should therefore not stop providers from innovating and proposing diversified forms of basic payment accounts, within our common standards of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore quite in favour, honourable Members, of the idea of maintaining a certain amount of flexibility for Member States on the question of prices. We will have to work, and that is what I am doing, on the question of relevant information for consumers and also on possible dispute settlement mechanisms between consumers and professionals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the last important point is the role of the Member States. We need the Member States in order to adopt this text. We must look very closely at what is being done at national level and build on what is being done best. As you know, honourable Members, some Member States are not in favour of this idea or are not enthusiastic about this initiative from the EU. We will therefore have to act in a convincing and determined way and draw up an effective, balanced proposal to persuade them to support our proposal in the Council. In any case, you can, of course, count on my own determination over the coming weeks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we were very disappointed, Mr Barnier, to find that, in contrast to what was announced in the work programme for 2011, there was no legislative proposal, but merely a recommendation to the Member States. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that today, you are showing your determination to submit a legislative proposal by the autumn at the latest, I hope, because we all know that calls to the Commission simply do not achieve anything.</p>
      <p sl="de">A total of 30 million citizens are waiting to have access to a basic account, so that they can perform the fundamental tasks that are part of life in today’s society. These 30 million citizens are seasonal workers, people on low incomes, the homeless and students, and all of them have a right to a bank account. We need to make sure that they get one.</p>
      <p sl="de">The basic account must also be cost-effective. We must not allow these people to be excluded again because of the cost, because they have no address or for some of the other reasons that are often given. We must ensure that they have a right to a bank account, because we cannot accept a situation in our society where there are first and second class citizens. For this reason, I very much hope that you will be able to persuade the College of Commissioners very quickly. We will help you, Mr Barnier, to make sure that the Member States ultimately also agree, because these really are fundamental rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, can I thank Commissioner Barnier for his response and also the rapporteur for the report. We should acknowledge that Commissioner Barnier has had a major role in protecting consumers and I am very pleased to hear what he said here this evening in relation to acting on proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Seven per cent of the adult population within the European Union is a very big number. In my own country, 100 000 adults do not have bank accounts and many of them receive, for example, social welfare payments in cash via post offices; they do not have the option to have it paid into a bank account because they cannot get a bank account. This has implications in this day and age for things like shopping on the Internet, for taking advantage of bargains that become available, for buying tickets, for booking events – things that we all take as the normal way of conducting our business.</p>
      <p sl="en">Discussions on how to reform the banking sector have been going on now for some considerable time, but I think there needs to be more discussion and more consideration of how we get the banks to actually act in favour of individuals and in favour of the public good. Looking, for example, at the enormity of the bank rescue in Ireland, where the government injected or committed EUR 62 billion of public funding to the banks, I think banks should be going out of their way now to show that they have what Commissioner Barnier called that ‘humanist touch’ and should start to take account of people who are suffering and hurting.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be very useful if the Commissioner were, at some stage, to give some thought to the idea of how he might encourage the return of traditional bank managers, managers who assess people on their track record, on their character, on their knowledge of the business, on the sort of person they are. There is far too much automaticity in the banking system. We need to get much further back to the human touch.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, financial exclusion is a major problem. Being unable to make normal bank transactions at a reasonable cost is disabling in modern society. Millions of European consumers are currently struggling with this problem. It does not need to be like this, and it should not be like this either.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is therefore good that we are now asking the Commission to present a legislative proposal which will grant all consumers in the EU the right to open and use a basic payment account. This is a small reform that will nevertheless help many people.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Three aspects of this are particularly important. Firstly, all normal, everyday transactions should be included in this type of account. Secondly, the legislation needs to contain a ceiling for how much the basic payment services can cost per year. Without this ceiling, the cost would probably rocket sky high. This new right would then not be of much help. If the service became too expensive, many consumers would not be able to afford to use it in a normal way either.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thirdly, the legislation should make all payment service providers obliged to offer the basic payment account. That will avoid the social stigmatisation that could arise if commercially less attractive consumers were to be funnelled to any one particular payment service provider.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Member States have not yet done their homework. If that trend continues, we expect a hastily prepared legislative proposal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we all know that cash in our society is increasingly being replaced by electronic forms of payment and, of course, access to a basic bank account is then all the more important. Many things become a problem in our society if you do not have access to such an account. Receiving wages, pension payments, paying utility bills and the purchase of products or services all become very difficult if we cannot open a basic bank account. Access to such a payment service is of crucial importance, certainly for disadvantaged and highly mobile consumers and people who are today increasingly on the move between the various countries of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For example, Erasmus students staying abroad, frontier workers and retired people working part-time in a different country are still too often denied such essential and basic payment services. I am therefore pleased that we and Parliament are increasing pressure on Member States. We are also advocating the option that any consumer who is not able to get a bank account in one Member State should have access to a bank account in the Member State where he or she resides or carries out a particular job.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also think it is very important that, if Member States take no action, we work towards a binding European legislative proposal before January 2013. In that sense, Parliament would actually partly be following what the Belgian Government did some time ago and, as a result of which, we have had a legislative framework since 2003 that has helped more people gain access to use basic payment services.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The information that should be distributed about basic payment services is important. Gaining access to them should be a transparent process. We need to examine various systems, as the Commission has announced, but obviously basic banking services must also be comprehensive enough to be inclusive and capable of processing the most basic payments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we were to adopt a legislative framework, I would be pleased if both Member States and European bodies worked to ensure that this basic service is not abused. Access should be kept to as wide a segment of the population as possible, but a basic payment account obviously cannot compete unfairly with an ordinary banking service. I am therefore pleased that Member States will hopefully soon be required to provide everyone with access to these basic banking services.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, it is high time that we in the EU established the right of all citizens to have access to an account and an obligation for all banks to provide an account. I would, of course, be very pleased if we in the EU simply did not need to introduce this sort of legislation and the Member States or, better still, the banks themselves took on the task of ensuring that all citizens had access to an account.</p>
      <p sl="da">Reality is, however, a lot more serious. It shows us that 7% of all adults in Europe today do not have access to an account. I therefore think that we need to take responsibility as the EU and say that this must be a definite right within the Union. We know it is a question of students, migrants and the poorest in our society, who are perhaps not the most attractive customers for banks, but that makes it no less important to ensure that they have access to an account, because this is also a tool for active inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would therefore just like to say that it is crucial that the Commission presents us with a legislative proposal, and it is vital that tomorrow, this House provides very broad support for the splendid text from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>

      <p sl="cs">If you defend this right here, then all of your arguments will follow the line that you are defending a mandatory entitlement, and that something that is a mandatory entitlement must be created. You well know that when we were looking for common ground and a joint compromise in debating Mr Klute’s report, we came up against problems which we were unable to decide on at that time. We were unable to resolve these problems and they will also clearly be difficult to resolve in the future.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Do not forget, we debated what the fee should be for opening an account, and what the fee should be for managing an account.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Klute for this own-initiative report. In actual fact, having access to basic banking services is not only a condition enabling the single market to function properly, but it is also a requirement for economic and social progress. This access to basic banking services should be provided at the lowest possible cost to the public and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, however, we are in a banking world where we watch banks committing abuses against the public, especially the uninformed public, in terms of the charges levied for different banking services. In particular, we are in a banking world where we have learnt with dismay that some large banks have even manipulated the way in which the market determines those benchmark interest rates which are used as the base rates in credit contracts with variable interest rates.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In my own country, Romania, as well as in other countries, the banking system is dominated by foreign banks. What do we notice then in these countries? That the charges paid for banking services by citizens in my country and other countries are higher than the charges which these banks levy in their own countries where they have their headquarters. There are also free banking services which are charged for in my country and other countries. This is why I will vote in favour of Mr Klute’s report tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, financial inclusion is vital in order for the financial system to serve Europeans and for us to hit Europe 2020 strategy targets. It is unacceptable that, out of the 30 million Europeans who do not have a bank account, almost 6.5 million, the most vulnerable, are not in a position to open one and therefore pay a price that can amount to EUR 1 per day.</p>
      <p sl="es">I support Mr Klute’s proposal of a legislative initiative on this issue, and I welcome Commissioner Barnier’s announcement that he will table one before the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union must ensure access to minimum banking services such as opening a basic account, with no obstacles due to price.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I agree that consumers need access to basic bank accounts in all Member States, but I do not think that requiring all Europe’s commercial retail banks to provide such centrally defined accounts is necessarily in the best interests of all consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me explain. In Wales, there is currently a strong network of credit unions that provide basic banking services to the most disadvantaged group of people in society. They go far beyond simply providing people with bank accounts. They also provide advice and help to those people who have difficulty managing their basic finances. They help those who cannot afford to pay for help to understand financial services and provide a personal relationship manager that the large retail banks will never be in a position to provide; this certainly will not be a commercially viable proposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">Access to bank accounts for everybody is likely to put the business of these credit unions in jeopardy and force them out, so that, while people will end up with a bank account, they will lose all the added value that they are getting from these local institutions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I am concerned that in some Member States, people do not have the opportunity to access basic banking services and there is still cumbersome red tape involved. As a result, the use of e-commerce and online fund transfers is at a very low level. This initiative is absolutely vital for supporting consumers who are financially vulnerable and those who are commercially less attractive, who will have access from now on to basic payment accounts without any restrictions imposed by banks for subjective reasons, thereby enjoying simplified procedures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that banking service providers must be motivated from now on to target their efforts at wide-ranging campaigns aimed at encouraging and informing the public.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe, as has been said, 30 million citizens currently do not have a bank account. Let us be clear, then: banking exclusion causes and exacerbates the spiral of social exclusion. The consequences of this are extremely serious.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet the banks clearly have their share of responsibility for this situation. The information and support provided by banks is not effective enough. Or rather, the banking system is extremely effective for those who have the means and extremely exclusive for all those who do not.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I think the solution to be explored has certainly been mentioned: it is, without a doubt, to force the banks to open an account that is adapted to each individual, enabling them to carry out the most basic transactions, such as receiving money, particularly payments. There also undoubtedly needs to be better education for people who do not have a bank account, who do not use one and who do not think they need one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It would be useful to try to change behaviour from this point of view.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, holding a bank account is a prerequisite for fully participating in economic and social life. This will enable consumers to enjoy all the benefits provided by the internal market, especially the freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should point out that, in spite of this, as my fellow Member, Mr Tarabella, also mentioned, there are currently around 30 million people still without a bank account. These consumers have to pay higher costs because they use cash excessively. This is why I consider it important to promote financial and social inclusion for consumers throughout the whole of Europe. This will make it possible to improve considerably the lives of several million Europeans. It is important to end practices which exclude people from accessing such a basic service.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, millions of our citizens have been refused a basic payment account, which renders their daily life extremely difficult in a world dominated by, and dependent on, information technologies. A situation of financial exclusion equates to social exclusion. Legislative action in many of our Member States has proved effective at providing what has nowadays become an essential social service.</p>
      <p sl="en">People in the EU are citizens, not merely consumers and, just because a person is not attractive to a bank in terms of profits, this cannot justify a denial of the means to make basic payments, especially when our exchequers and our taxpayers have done and suffered so much to save our financial institutions from the brink of disaster.</p>
      <p sl="en">A payment account has become necessary for interaction and autonomy in our societies and is a right we must grant to our citizens regardless of their credit status, employment status or residence. I hope the Commission will heed the calls from this evening. This is a commendable report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted with this debate this evening on access to basic banking services, services which must be made available at the lowest possible price, or even for free. This is essential for their accessibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, around 30 million people do not have access to basic banking services in Europe. How can we save these people from exclusion? It was on the basis of this question that I tabled a recommendation on the subject in my report on the fight against poverty, which was adopted in 2011, underlining the fact that the inability of people living in poverty to make use of basic banking services is a considerable obstacle to their re-entry into the labour market and reintegration into society.</p>

    <intervention id="2-636-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am grateful to each and every one of you for your questions and particularly for your encouragement and support for this idea, which Mr Klute has illustrated well in his report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Swinburne and Mr Schmidt mentioned a point that I want to clarify. There is no desire to exclude establishments which are today already aimed at these kinds of people. What we want to propose is the principle of access. We are not appointing providers. This point should therefore be clear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would first like to thank Ms Gebhardt, and also Mr Ludvigsson, Mr Tarabella, and Mr Daerden for their support and encouragement. Yes, it is indeed a question of having a real banking service for the 7% of the population who are excluded from it, that is, from real services, a real guarantee of access for all citizens living legally in the EU and also very low costs in order to respond to the concern that Ms Băsescu has just mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree with Mr Mitchell and Mr De Backer about the link between this basic bank account and everything that happens in the single electronic market, particularly with regard to paying wages, but also with regard to all e-commerce activities. We also mentioned this question in the Green Paper on electronic payments, which deals with the initiatives that we will propose in the autumn at more or less the same time in order to develop secure, efficient, low-cost payments. This will only produce results if all the citizens of the EU, and not just 93% of them, have a basic bank account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Gebhardt and Ms Turunen highlighted the fact that we have completed the recommendation stage, which, it seems to me, was too long in their view, but which nonetheless took place over a limited period of time. I have not forgotten that some Member States, such as Belgium, Italy and others, have indeed taken action, but we can clearly see that, for many other Member States, a binding legislative act is needed. That is what I will propose to you in a few weeks’ time. We are very determined and very focused on our plan to offer this access to basic banks accounts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Sanchez Presedo, who is very familiar with these subjects, which worry consumers, as he is rapporteur for the text on mortgage credits, and Mr Stolojan mentioned the economic and social conditions just a moment ago, and Ms Prendergast talked about equity. All of these ideas are covered by this proposal so that all aspects of the internal market, particularly the financial aspects, can be fairer and more human.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I can confirm that we will not stop there. In the autumn, I am going to tackle, through a legislative text, the question of the transparency of banking costs, which this time concerns all consumers and all citizens. Then, there is the question of banking mobility. These are the three points, along with the basic bank account, that we will tackle in this latest package on consumer protection, and particularly protection for the most vulnerable citizens in our society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Barnier, you are falling behind. The Commission’s work programme for 2011 announced that there would be a legislative proposal guaranteeing that all legally resident consumers in the EU had access to basic banking services. There are 30 million EU citizens who are currently denied this. In Austria alone, for example, 150 000 people live in households where no one has a bank account and, for most of them, this is not a voluntary choice. Financial exclusion is a major problem and, therefore, the basic account must be cheap to run. There must be an upper limit for charges which should cover all the basic transactions, so that the citizens of Europe can go about their ordinary everyday business. Mr Barnier, you need to take action. You must persuade the College of Commissioners quickly, so that we can consider this proposal in Parliament soon.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In relation to access to basic banking services for European citizens, I would again like to point out one closely connected problem. There are persistent differences between interbank fees. There are large differences between the fees charged in different Member States, but also noticeable differences between banks themselves. The consumer is always the first to suffer from the resulting lack of transparency. I therefore believe that the Commission should focus on improving the functioning of the single European payment area and its transparency. The elimination of these problems is, in my opinion, an important building block for consumer confidence in respect of banking services, including the use of bank accounts. A separate chapter is devoted to citizens who, for whatever reason, are unable to open or operate a payment account. Here, the report provides a clear opinion that every consumer across the EU should have a guaranteed right of access to basic banking services, and I fully agree with this. I also welcome the call for access to a basic bank account to be free of charge, or for the costs of access to be reasonable. The use of a basic payment account should not be connected with any form of discrimination in terms of the end consumer. It is equally important for access to a basic payment account not to be conditional on the purchase of any additional services, whether of a financial or non-financial nature.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would congratulate you and the Commissioner, and show my satisfaction at such an important issue, which probably does not need four minutes because, fortunately, it was a matter that we have dealt with based on a broad consensus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we all know, the Commission’s proposal aims to guarantee the continuation of direct payments for the transition year between the current common agricultural policy (CAP) and the reformed CAP, under the new multiannual financial framework. This proposal defines national envelopes for direct payments in calendar year 2013, that is, financial year 2014, and, within the overall amount available, as regards the direct payments, aims to make room for the new Member States’ phasing in and to guarantee the equivalent mechanism for the modulation to guarantee stability in the amounts allocated to farmers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For the transition year, that is 2013, Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has introduced some new provisions, so as to deal with certain Member States’ particular situations on funding for the second pillar of the CAP. I am talking, in particular, about the United Kingdom, Germany and Sweden.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For 2013, the possibility of new Member States using, or continuing to use, national top-ups under the first CAP pillar was included, and a similar provision was made for the Republic of Cyprus following the request made in the trialogue negotiations. The result of these negotiations was duly transmitted to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and a broad consensus was reached on the results.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should therefore like to show my appreciation for the provision of services by the Commission, the collaboration of the Danish Presidency, the Council, the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Members involved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, for having risen to the efficiency required for this report, as we particularly wanted to safeguard the guarantee of payments for this transition year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would therefore urge a majority vote and the adoption of this text during this plenary sitting, so as to conclude the role of this report’s colegislator and enable the official publication of this legislation, so as to make payments to farmers for next year in time. That is all, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, I am pleased to say that the legislative procedure for the adoption of the Commission’s proposal on the application of direct payments in 2013 is now in its final stages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, but also the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), Mr De Castro, for their strong commitment to making quick progress with this issue throughout this procedure and also for their desire to reach an agreement with the Council at first reading, which will help us to take a quick decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the swift adoption of this regulation in order to ensure the proper application of direct payments in 2013. That is why I am pleased that this compromise text is on the agenda for this plenary sitting ahead of tomorrow’s vote.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During the informal trialogue which took place on 24 May 2012, a political agreement was concluded with Parliament and the Council on the Commission’s proposal. This compromise text contains a number of amendments which are considered necessary for a joint agreement between Parliament and the Council and which the Commission can support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also aware that some elements of this political agreement have been concluded on the basis of the principle that the scope of this transitional regulation is limited to 2013 and it does not prejudge decisions to be taken within the framework of the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and also the financial perspectives which I hope will be adopted soon.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for myself, of course, and on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I wish to very much applaud the fact that this legislative procedure is concluding quickly and at first reading. Only one facet is, of course, of direct interest to the Committee on Budgets, and that is the link that direct payments in 2013 have with the new multiannual financial framework. As you know, the agricultural year in financial terms concludes on 15 October, and any direct payments to be disbursed in 2013 will, in fact, come under the 2014 budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, this multiannual financial framework is far from nimble on its feet, and the conclusion of the Danish Presidency was simply to pass on the work done to the Cypriot Presidency, which will have the task of carrying it on. We all hope that this task will be completed as quickly as possible, because this will not only allow direct payments in 2013, but will obviously enable the reform to be implemented in as short a timeframe as possible.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done. This dossier is indicative of several things.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Firstly, as far as the Commission is concerned, this is the institution which formulates the European Union’s policies. Its job is to draft the initial proposals, and we all know how important these are. It is also the body which distributes the payments. This is why I want to call on the Commission to take the new Member States into consideration. I want it to be more ambitious in its actions. We need to achieve a genuinely fair common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, I want to focus on the actual Member States of the Council. They are in the easiest position to be able to identify the needs of farmers in the individual countries. It is their job to draft their national position. This is why I want to call on even greater cooperation from them. They are a vitally important part of the decision-making process, regardless of the fact that they are not present during the plenary sitting. I want them to know that their position is important to us.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Lastly, we MEPs are the ones who need to take into account everyone’s interests, horizontally and vertically: from those of the ordinary farmer to those of the whole European Union. I also wish that compromise, equality and fairness are the main features of the other reports on CAP reform, just as in this report. Congratulations once again.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, I wholeheartedly support all of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, and I am especially pleased by the amendments that permit the new Member States to apply complementary national support in 2013. Without these opportunities for support, direct payments to Estonia would, for example, fall by roughly 20% in 2013, which would be difficult to survive. The fact that a reasonable compromise was reached in the preparation of this report also bodes well and is a good beginning for all of the upcoming discussions concerning the years 2014-2020, which will be a much more difficult period. This will give all Baltic farmers optimism that we in this House can find good compromises when planning the new agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Capoulas Santos, who has always been a great defender of agriculture; we hope that he will continue to be so during the next common agricultural policy reform. He knows a great deal about the situations of the farmers who were waiting to receive continued direct payments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to speak briefly about the case of my country, Galicia, which is both an arable- and dairy-producing country, as we have mentioned here many times. Although the budget has been frozen for many rural development programmes, that is also due to the prevention of direct aid, in this case.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This regulation, which establishes standards for the current direct payment system, presents a consensus draft which is very important at a time in which the agricultural sector is experiencing substantial difficulties because of the lack of State aid from the Member States. This adjustment, equivalent to compulsory modulation, is also an important signal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is worth remembering that the budget planned for the next reform will considerably reduce the proportion of the Member States’ gross domestic product, so that we take that into account when looking at the future of the upcoming reform.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his work. I am grateful for the fact that in 2013, farmers will receive further tranches of much needed direct payments without hindrance. I would like to express the hope that the year 2013 will truly be the last year in which such significant imbalances in the system of direct payment distribution occur. It is nearly 10 years since 10 new Member States acceded to the European Union. Farmers in those countries accepted the fact that for 10 years, they would have to operate under unequal conditions of competition, but that period was to end in 2013 for those 10 countries, and a little later in the case of Romania and Bulgaria. It is my earnest hope that just as the rapporteur made every effort on this matter, you too, Mr President, and all of us, will take pains when it comes to the main report – the most important report under discussion in this parliamentary term concerning the system of direct payments after 2014 – to eliminate discrimination and inequalities between Member States regarding direct payments.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, we believe that the finances of 2013 are being developed as the base year for the new multiannual financial frameworks. Direct payments are an important financial mechanism for ensuring equal opportunities to all, solidarity and development. My group and my electors in Latvia believe that proper determination of direct payments is not only necessary for a common, honest and fair market, but also very important in the social sphere. I support what I find to be very proper steps laid out with regard to this in the report of Mr Capoulas Santos, as well as the Commission’s stance on this matter, but we must go farther.</p>
      <p sl="lv">We believe that direct payments should be no smaller than 80% of the European Union average. Then we will be able to talk about fairness. Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian farmers receive direct payments. The amounts they are receiving today are discriminatory. Such injustice must be rectified. This situation has already led to, for example, Latvian farmers leaving the country and land being cheaply purchased by the rich people of other countries. As a result, more and more villages are losing this status, as there are no more people living in them, and agricultural land is becoming overgrown. I give my thanks to those working to prevent such things from happening.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all his work and the progress that he has made in relation to the direct payments issue for 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst it is important to make provision for the payments in 2013, it is also important to make provision in the amendment for the rural development spend. For us in the UK, that has also been very important. It is also very significant for us that there are payment commitments for less favoured areas and for the agri-environment schemes that are so important.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also very important is that the transition for these payments must be smooth, and limited in its impact on farmers’ incomes, especially in the light of the ongoing volatility within world markets. Therefore I believe that we can be pleased with the progress to date and the constructive outcomes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current reform of the common agriculture policy post-2013 must also recognise the importance of direct payments and support through Pillar 2 for those actively farming to produce traceable, wholesome food and promote food security within Europe. I believe that Pillar 1 payments should remain as direct support to recognise the extra lengths that farmers go to in producing food. Pillar 2 is best placed to deliver tailored outcomes in rural development and in the environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also believe it is important that we must be very strong in achieving a credible budget settlement in the MFF and, most importantly, we must correct the imbalances in rural development allocations; this is especially important for countries like the United Kingdom, which traditionally has a very poor allocation. That historical imbalance now needs to be sorted out.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the draft report on the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013 provides the legal framework required at the moment. The rules tabled by the Commission and rapporteur, whom I would like to thank, are balanced and suitable for the new Member States like Bulgaria or Romania. No adjustments are provided for these states since direct payments are still not fully phased in. No net ceilings have been set either for Romania or Bulgaria for the total amount of direct payments, which is a fair decision.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This report enables Parliament to take a further step towards preparing the new European agricultural policy. The steps which will follow are definitely more important and will pose a major challenge. We will shortly be debating the reports from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and every topic will be dealt with at the appropriate time. However, based on today’s report, I would like to stress that it will be important for us to continue to examine together how we can create a fair system. For instance, how can we ensure that Romania and Bulgaria, which are still having direct payments phased in, are already able to achieve this from 2014?</p>

This is a positive development and an important moment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his very good work which, most importantly, was completed quickly. This regulation must come into force on 1 January 2014 to ensure that there are no financing problems during the transition from the current regulation to the next reformed regulation on direct payments. Therefore, it was particularly important for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement quickly. Continuity in financing is a decisive factor for the Member States. This is why it is so important that the transitional regulation for 2013 comes into force at the right time. The current regulation on direct payments remains valid in 2013, but some of the financial provisions in the regulation only apply until 2012.</p>

It is amazing that he has managed to find time to fit it in, with everything else he has been undertaking. This is a bit of solid work on the part of Parliament and the Commission in terms of giving some welcome clarity going forward for our farmers that rural development programmes and LFA direct payments will continue in the bridging period into the next CAP. There is not a great degree of controversy around the Chamber tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">You might wonder why we are devoting parliamentary time to this at all. However, let us not forget that this is controversial in certain circumstances and certain circles. There are Member States which want to cut direct payments to farmers. However, from a Scottish perspective, direct payments are of crucial support to farm incomes and we very much want to see them continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased that the Scottish Government has been so constructive and so in the mainstream of European thinking. It is rather unfortunate that our present Member State has been rather less constructive in its negotiations, not least over the general nature of the budget. However, Commissioner, I can assure you that you do have some allies in the British Isles. I look forward to working with you for the betterment of Europe’s agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to say that we must, in my view, re-examine, within the framework of this debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), a basic price setting mechanism for a series of production data with aid modulations depending on data related to geographical location, the work being carried out and the environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, many of my constituents have contacted me regarding being disadvantaged by an uneven playing field in the direct payments and CAP in general. Direct payments, or direct subsidies to farmers, account for three quarters of the CAP budget, which, of course, is 48% of the EU budget, so it is quite a considerable amount of money. However, the Conservative-led British Government is reluctant to make use of some of those discretionary funds that are available to support our farmers. In fact, they are increasing the uneven playing field by wishing to voluntarily reduce direct payments faster than any other Member State, which is why I will be voting against Amendments 1 to 12 and 13.</p>
      <p sl="en">The struggles of UK farmers are compounded by the Commission’s ongoing use of the historical distribution key to allocate Pillar 2 funds between Member States. This discrimination against the UK primarily needs to stop. We need a fairer allocation of Pillar 2 farmers and to protect our farmers in the UK.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, the draft allows for the granting of unreduced direct agricultural subsidies to new Member States in 2013. In 2012, we finally managed to equalise the level of support granted to new and old Member States. This, however, does not mean an equalisation of the subsidy amounts, as pointed out very correctly by Mr Wojciechowski. I, for one, am very pleased that Mr Capoulas Santos understood the problem that will, unfortunately, represent a major issue for new Member States as of 2014, namely, that these Member States will need to switch from the SAPS to the SPS, and will not be able to carry over their existing benefits that are based on Article 68(1)(b) and (c) and on ‘top-up’, that is, national complementary payments. This was, unfortunately, left out of the Commission draft, but the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, understood the problem. The new Member States, these 12 Member States that will be transitioning from the SAPS to the SPS, must not be put at a disadvantage. I would like to ask Commissioner Cioloş to take steps to this end at Commission level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there was some concern, both in London and Holyrood, when the Commissioner published the legislative proposals which missed out the inclusion of the voluntary modulation powers. Clearly, both in England and in Scotland, without the ability to top-slice single farm payments and switch the money into rural development, the rural development programmes, both in England and Scotland, would have huge financial black holes in them for the year 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thankfully, as a result of the strong lobbying of the Commission by both the UK and Scottish Governments, and with the assistance of my colleagues here in Parliament – Luis Capoulas Santos, Paolo De Castro, Jim Nicholson, etc. – we have managed to insert them back into the package. That will give some reassurance that both the United Kingdom and Scottish Governments now have the power to decide whether they want to top-slice farmers’ single farm payments and switch the money in order to plug that financial black hole in the rural development programmes in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Luis and Paolo for their cooperation. I wish you well, Luis. I hope the next two legislative packages go as smoothly and as speedily as this one has, but I somehow have my doubts.</p>

We are talking about combating the budgetary crisis and a need for solidarity. Poorer countries such as Slovakia, for example, also contributed to the support of southern European countries which are experiencing difficulties.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this proposal, which is largely administrative but gives European farmers a level of certainty for the next financial year. More broadly, I have a couple of points to make on the related issue of direct payments to farmers from 2014 onwards and which arose out of meetings I have held in my constituency over the last couple of weeks. First of all, on the issue of coupled support, I think we will have to look at the changes to Mr Capoulas Santos’s report and look at possibly deleting the list. This would allow Member States greater flexibility to determine the precise nature of the coupled support provided nationally.</p>
      <p sl="en">On greening, I think it will be important to increase the baseline from crop to diversification which, as it stands, is impractical, especially for small and medium farmers. Also, in relation to the ecological focus areas, again we need to ensure that the percentages are workable and that we have a comprehensive and precise list of what is and what is not included in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the issue of convergence, I welcome Mr Capoulas Santos’s softening of the Commission proposals, and I think more will need to be done to ensure that the viability of farm businesses at national level is not threatened by policy changes at European level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my constituency in Wales depends heavily on the rural economy; farming in particular is a vital contributor to the Welsh economy. Given the extent of less-favoured area farming, however, Welsh farmers are disproportionately reliant on direct payments. Without these payments, many farming families would probably leave the business altogether. I therefore welcome the move to allow these direct farm payments to continue on an historic basis for the coming year until the new CAP is in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would, however, make a plea that transitional arrangements under any new agreement should be flexible and open to regional interpretation as our farmers adapt to the new rules.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the year 2013 is a transitional year as it will see the conclusion of the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013. It is also associated, however, with the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. I endorse the support given to agricultural holdings in the new Member States which receive in excess of EUR 5 000 due to a generally lower level of payments in these Member States. At the same time, I am in favour of other temporary solutions adopted in this regulation being aimed at ensuring equal conditions for competition between farmers from the new Member States, the new twelve, and the old Member States, the old fifteen. Taking into account the fact that in 2013, there will not be any sectoral support within the framework of complementary national direct payments, as well as the fact that the proposed structure of direct support after 2013 does not provide for equalising direct payments, the imbalances will still remain.</p>

This means that we will be able to continue with modulation and also support farmers in the old Member States. This debate and our discussion show that we all consider direct payments to be a very important instrument for supporting farmers. Nowadays, however, maintaining direct payments at different levels seems unjustified when farmers are operating across the single market and selling their goods at similar prices throughout the entire EU, whilst also purchasing the means of production at equal prices. We have a situation where farmers in France pay exactly the same for tractors, agricultural machinery and fertilisers as farmers in Poland. This concerns not only the old Member States but also the new ones. Currently, differences are maintained across the old Member States. Farmers in France receive different direct payments from farmers in Germany, and different amounts again are received by farmers in Poland and Lithuania. These discrepancies should be eliminated in the new multiannual financial framework after 2014.</p>

      <p sl="fr">There was never any question as to whether direct payments would be granted in 2013, but it is true that we needed this regulation to clarify certain aspects, certain transitional measures, both for new Member States which have a payment system based on surface area and also for those which grant complementary payments, due to the difference that still exists compared with the EU average. We were able to clarify these conditions thanks to this regulation. However, as some of you have mentioned, this will also enable certain Member States, such as the United Kingdom, to maintain this voluntary modulation between direct payments and rural development in 2013 in order to be able to continue to finance measures within the framework of rural development.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I come from a region where agricultural holdings make up over 60% of the total area, and where, for many inhabitants, agricultural production is the basic and usually the only source of income. As a result, I feel obliged to appeal for fair treatment for farmers in all of the Member States. However, the upcoming reform of the common agricultural policy 2014–2020 is our greatest concern. In this reform, the European Commission proposed a gradual equalisation of direct payments. If, however, we recognise what I feel is an unduly slow pace of evening out existing imbalances in the level of subsidies between Member States, we can but anticipate that achieving full equalisation will take several decades. This will impact negatively on the competitiveness and profitability of farmers mainly from the new Member States, including Poland.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Reducing the discrepancies in direct payments is an important issue for Polish farmers. If we advocate a single market and the competitiveness of European agriculture, such large disparities in payments between individual states, or even between regions, must not exist. As EU data shows, the Union average is at the level of EUR 271 per hectare, while in Poland, it currently stands at EUR 214. In my region, I am frequently asked about the level of future payments to Polish farmers, about ways to reduce bureaucracy, and about how to make the best use of payments in order to stimulate competition in agriculture and reduce unemployment. From 2014, these disparities will most likely be reduced slightly. The payment will increase to around EUR 223-231, but Polish farmers will still be receiving over 20% less than the European average.

This is especially true for Member States that joined the EU after 2004, as in these countries the standard of living of agricultural producers is extremely low, and any reductions in the amount of payments could entail serious consequences for the region’s agricultural sector. I believe that Europe must face the fact that in the eastern parts of the continent, the very viability of agricultural production depends on retaining the level of direct payments.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At a time when the reform of the European Union’s common agricultural policy is being negotiated and this draft regulation is the first report from this reform package which will be adopted, I am pleased that the negotiations between the Council and Parliament have not encountered any major problems and have managed to reach a compromise at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Bearing in mind that direct payments have provided, and continue to provide, a vital instrument for supporting European agriculture and farmers in Member States, it was vital to ensure the continuity of this instrument for the period immediately ahead as well and for the calendar year 2013. Farmers in Member States who are eligible for complementary national direct payments up to 2012 need a transition period up until the future legislation on direct payments is adopted, which will come into force from 1 January 2014.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The proposal to amend the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of direct payments to farmers mainly concerns the year 2013. We should remember, however, that the calendar year 2013 corresponds to the financial year 2014, which makes it part of the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. The regulation presented should, therefore, be discussed from a broader perspective, and not just as provisions for a twelve-month transitional period. There is little objection to the specification of net ceilings for direct payments for the calendar year 2013 as contained in the regulation, with the aim of ensuring stable payment levels and the phasing in of these in new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The regulation, however, lacks a clear reference to the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. It should contain a clear declaration on ending the unequal direct payments to farmers which are unfair to the new Member States as they are many times lower than the payments made in the states of the so-called old Union. There is no rational justification for sanctioning the disparities which exist concerning the financing of agriculture and which artificially split Europe into two where the agricultural sector is concerned. Not only is it unjust, it also restricts agricultural competitiveness in the new Member States, and is at variance with the much-heralded slogans about equal opportunities and the alignment of development across old and new EU Member States. The lack of a clear declaration on this matter may give rise to suspicions that the unequal treatment of farmers will continue into the future. That would be quite unacceptable.</p>

    <intervention id="2-681-000" speaker_id="96891" name="Paolo DE CASTRO" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Italy" birth_date="02-02-1958" birth_place="S. Pietro Vernotico" m_state="IT">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon abolishes the old comitology system, replacing it with a two-tier structure, consisting of delegated acts which include Parliament’s and the Council’s right of veto, and implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament from each step in the approval process. The existing body of legislation therefore had to be aligned to the new legal reality. We started this exercise with the three most important regulations all of which, Mr President, I shall deal with together, and which make up the heart of the agricultural policy: the regulations on direct payments, on rural development and on the common organisation of the markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission’s proposals immediately appeared to be quite balanced and there were very few changes made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI). In particular, as regards direct payments, delegated acts must be used in cases where the basic act is amended, and in cases where rights are conferred to farmers or reversely where negative consequences may be incurred. In addition, given the spirit of the treaty on the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget, we felt that the financial discipline process could no longer be applied without the participation of Parliament. Indeed, maintaining Article 11 unchanged, with the Council acting on a proposal from the Commission, would constitute an unacceptable continuation of the Council’s exclusive right to implement measures directly.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards rural development, we believe that the Commission has done an accurate repartition between more general provisions establishing additional elements, and which therefore require delegated acts, and more technical elements that are very much connected with the discretion that Member States enjoy in implementing this measure, and which therefore require implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="it">By contrast, the proposed alignment with the regulation on the common organisation of the markets has proved to be more problematic, especially on issues connected with Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The article in question provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt measures on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations. This is an exception to paragraph 2 of the same article, which requires the ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) to be used for the common agricultural policy. As an exception, Article 43(3) needs to be interpreted restrictively, that is, only when there are provisions that do not form part of the fundamental policy decisions, which must be taken pursuant to Article 43(2) of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore believe that the Commission proposal does not interpret Article 43(3) in a sufficiently restrictive way. The task of drawing up conditions and criteria for fixing aid amounts, export refunds and minimum export prices should remain with the legislator, which means Parliament and the Council, leaving to the Commission the fixing of amounts through implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="it">Once these three recommendations had been approved by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we began to negotiate with the Council and the Commission so that we could reach an agreement at first reading. The urgency was dictated by the imminent reform of the common agricultural policy, which we would not have wished to be encumbered by complex negotiations on institutional issues. Despite our willingness to negotiate, to concede something with respect to our initial position, and despite the outstanding activism first on the part of the Polish Presidency and then from the Danish Presidency, we were unable to find a compromise solution, hence the need for the committee to act efficiently and in a timely manner, on the one hand, and the new and stronger powers conferred on Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main obstacles we encountered were from the Council, which wishes to systematically and horizontally eliminate delegated acts, even where these are legally required, in order to replace them with implementing acts which completely exclude Parliament. Such a position is unacceptable to us, because it means surrendering the new prerogatives that the Treaty has assigned to us, thereby severely limiting the powers of Parliament. Another factor that made negotiations more difficult was the attitude of the Commission which, during the negotiations, moved from a position close to that of Parliament to siding with the Council’s, leaving us alone in the battle to defend the most authentic interpretation of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are now faced with the difficult negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy; we therefore decided to ask plenary to confirm the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s vote on alignment, so as to strengthen our position when we negotiate future agricultural policy. Indeed, only by defending the prerogatives of Parliament can we be sure to respect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and, at the same time, ensure that in future, the CAP is more democratic and closer to citizens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the alignment of the so-called horizontal regulation to the new provisions of the Treaty is based on a classification into delegated powers and implementing powers regarding the provisions adopted by the Commission pursuant to that regulation. After carefully scrutinising the Commission proposal, based on the criteria defined for the two types of act, respectively Articles 290 and 291, we identified areas where the conditions for delegated acts were met, and then examined the proposal in terms of the conditions for implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), we tabled a few amendments on the conditions of the delegation, its period, the timeframes for objecting to a delegated act, the extension of that period, committee procedures, in accordance with the common understanding on practical arrangements, and the use of delegated acts, adopted by the Conference of Presidents on 3 March 2011, and Regulation No 182/2011 of Parliament and the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this area, I recall one of the points of disagreement with the Council was the wish to use implementing acts in situations where, under the Treaty, these would be the most logical and appropriate tool. I believe that this Parliament, for its part, cannot surrender control of such important and sensitive issues such as transparency, Article 40A, or penalties for beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to admit that these alignment reports are a litmus test for a new working method that needs to be established between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, but which must be as effective as possible, according to a complex schema of competences that I hope will always and, in any case, converge towards the implementation of effective means for the development of European agriculture. In procedural terms, the majority required within the Council to block an implementing act is exactly the same as for a delegated act. The Council’s resistance to using delegated acts is therefore not justified and, if maintained, would be an unnecessary obstacle to the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
      <p sl="it">I must also say that we have proposed some items, which we believe are an improvement but, just like decommitment at national level, they failed to meet with the approval of the Commission and the Council, and will therefore again be the subject of negotiation and confrontation regarding horizontal regulation of CAP reform. The lack of agreement regarding the alignment of horizontal regulation led us to call on plenary to vote so that, as the Chair of AGRI, Mr De Castro, said, we may have greater bargaining power and take a firm stand from Parliament on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report, as well as others addressed so far, have, in any case, been an important moment for this Parliament, which, for the first time, through codecision, is actively involved in defining the new agricultural policy. It was not just a simple process of displacement, as claimed by many, but a serious awareness among my colleagues on the AGRI Committee of how well the CAP instruments have operated so far, so these instruments have to be brought up to date for the new reform through appropriate tools and constructive corrections.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wanted to close with a reference: we have seen through a long series of trialogues the difficulty of finding an agreement on alignment. It was a missed opportunity which could cause us to waste time during the next approval process for common agricultural policy reform.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, as in the case of the other two areas just referred to, we have also had to go into second reading on the subject of organic farming. This is regrettable, but we have held two trialogues and, in substantive terms, we have not made much progress. Although the atmosphere was pleasant and we were able to agree on many points, sadly, we could not reach agreement on the key issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">To give you some of the history: on 1 June last year, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted with a large majority to accept the report for amendment. After this, we began the negotiations, held preliminary talks with the Polish Presidency and then started discussions with the Danish Presidency. We made no progress on two points, which concerned the criteria for certain products and substances. We could not come to an agreement in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">We did not rely solely on our own opinion. We also obtained the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which clearly stated that these two articles were legal acts that came under the heading of delegated acts. This relates to Article 290, which regulates what this concerns and which clearly involves applying delegated acts. This is not a question of how something is regulated. Instead, a mandatory regulation is being introduced which is binding in the same manner across the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in Parliament understand that the Council naturally wants to be involved. We have repeatedly emphasised in the negotiations that we understand this and have submitted compromise proposals which went in the right direction, in other words, we have said that experts on a national level should be included. We have proposed incorporating the substances into the basic acts and we believe that this will work, because there have only been a total of two amendments in four years. Therefore, this is very much a practical solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of the entire procedure, I would like to say, and I endorse Mr De Castro’s criticism in this respect, that the Commission changed its approach to the delegated acts during the trialogue meetings and then spoke out in favour of implementing acts. We have not been able to understand this and it has led to many differences of opinion. Then a vague offer was made that we would simply be kept informed when amendments were introduced. From our perspective, just providing us with information cannot be conclusive. We have a right to delegated acts and we will reinforce this right during first reading. We hope that the Commission makes practical proposals which will allow us to enter into further negotiations with the Cypriot Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the report for which I am responsible, which is being discussed today, concerning Member State scrutiny of operations which are part of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, reflects the belief of the Committee on Agriculture regarding aligning this document with the related delegated acts and implementing acts introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Procedures were introduced in relation to the implementing acts under Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, which lays down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for Member State scrutiny of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers. Delegated acts take place in accordance with the development of informal negotiations between the three institutions. It is therefore essential that Parliament confirm this position through the vote which will take place tomorrow, which I hope will be passed by the greatest possible majority, so as to reaffirm Parliament’s position regarding its role as colegislator.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would therefore call on the Commission and the Council to adopt a narrow interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon, so as to enable progress with our work, in particular, as regards reforming the common agricultural policy. There is no time to waste. The Treaty of Lisbon has transformed the old comitology procedure, introducing a clear distinction between administrative acts, or implementing acts, as well as conferring on Parliament the right of veto of the latter, on an equal footing with the Council; that is, the right to repeal the delegation of an act to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is still an institutionalised procedure, according to which the Commission continues to be assisted by committees specialising in implementing acts, and it is inevitable that the Member States will consult experts for drawing up delegated acts. It is definitely necessary to find a balance between that which could be categorised as a basic act, as a delegated act, or as an implementing act, as long as the limits between different provisions leave a margin for interpretation. It is so as to achieve this balance that I would reiterate my call for a strict interpretation of the Treaty in which Parliament’s new powers are enshrined.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am not saying that Parliament should replace the EU’s executive, the Commission, or much less the governments of the Member States. I would simply demand for Parliament the power to scrutinise the new comitology, commensurate with its new role as colegislator, without promising effective decision making.</p>

    <intervention id="2-685-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, I am pleased that I once again have the opportunity to thank Parliament and its Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) and all of the rapporteurs for the considerable work that has already been accomplished. These efforts have enabled us to make progress on alignment issues, which we would all like to see resolved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we know, this alignment of agricultural legislation with the Treaty of Lisbon is primarily a very technical issue, as we have also seen from what the rapporteurs have presented, and it is legally quite complex, but it is also work that carries a great deal of political sensitivity and importance, particularly for Parliament, but also for all of the institutions involved in the decision and the implementation of the common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am fully aware of the political importance for Parliament of this discussion on alignment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr De Castro mentioned, the discussions began under the Hungarian Presidency and have continued for almost a year. We came very close to reaching an agreement at one time but, in the end, we found ourselves at an impasse after the last trialogue on 20 December 2011 under the Polish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Danish Presidency then decided to include the ‘alignment’ part of the four main regulations in the debate on CAP reform and to pursue negotiations on other alignment issues separately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to be clear. I have said this several times before the AGRI Committee, but I would like to say it again: I have always been careful to defend Parliament’s prerogatives, as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, in all of the alignment packages in order to achieve a balanced distribution of power between the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For every grey area, and every time that it was legally possible, I would like to point out that I have chosen an approach that allows the two institutions to play their part. By favouring delegated acts and by strictly adhering to Article 43(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon, which Mr De Castro mentioned, I have tried to move in the same direction as Parliament. That is why, for example, I favoured a role for both the Council and Parliament in financial discipline in the regulation on direct support. That is also why, when defining the obligations to maintain permanent pasture, I also favoured delegated acts. There are many examples, including in the very sensitive area of sanctions, and I would ask you to examine these in detail: you will see that the Commission has made efforts to move in the same direction as Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not surprising that, from this starting point, which ensures a greater role for Parliament, the Council has not always agreed and, of course, it has failed to reach compromises. However, generally speaking, from this starting point, which I have just defined, the overall compromise package in each alignment operation has strengthened Parliament’s prerogatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, we must ensure that this alignment does not have an impact on the discussions on the content of the CAP reform, which are very important for all of us. I consider this vote a sign that Parliament is going in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More specifically, with regard to the regulation on organic farming, which Mr Häusling mentioned, we have still not reached an agreement on the most sensitive point, that is, the procedure for the authorisation of the withdrawal of substances which may be used in this kind of agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I understand very well that you believe that the authorisation, or lack thereof, of certain substances or types of substances has political significance, particularly within the framework of organic farming. Therefore, you cannot accept being excluded from the decision-making process on these substances. I understand that very well and, what is more, I support this approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think, however, that your hesitation is closely linked to the regulation on organic farming which is currently being drafted. The criteria surrounding the authorisation of substances can be improved and adapted. I can understand that many of you think that it would be desirable to update them and to make them more specific as often as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is precisely what we are proposing to do. The Commission has just adopted a report on the experience gained in the implementation of the ‘organic farming’ regulation since 2009, since it has been in force. This report is the first step in a debate on improving the current legal framework for organic farming. We have just launched an assessment, an impact assessment, which will, in particular, deal with updating the criteria for the authorisation of substances used in organic farming. This analysis will be followed by legislative proposals aimed at improving the basic regulation. Parliament will be fully involved in this process, which will also encompass criteria for the authorisation of substances, which will be included in the basic act once the regulation that we are going to propose has been improved. Parliament will be involved because this amendment to the regulation will take place via the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once we have debated the content and once we have reached an agreement on criteria in particular, I think that the questions of procedure that we are concerned about today will come up again less acutely, because this adaptation of the basic legislative framework will be an opportunity to set more precise authorisation criteria with you. I hope that your concerns will then be appeased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In summary, I welcome your proposal to put the alignment issues to the vote in plenary tomorrow. This will allow us to determine Parliament’s position. It will then be possible to resume the interinstitutional discussions on a clearer basis. I hope that we will quickly reach an agreement and that we will dispel all of your concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will say it again: I will be directly and fully involved in this process of final discussions. Every time we have the opportunity to take a decision that will strengthen the role of Parliament, while legally respecting what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and the regulation under consideration, I will ensure that Parliament is able to fully assume its role as colegislator and oversee the implementation of these legislative acts.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, with regard to support for rural development by the EAFRD, I congratulate all the rapporteurs for the excellent documents presented during this joint debate. Europe’s rural sector is facing numerous challenges: major differences between regions, rural areas in demographic decline, low per capita incomes, a less developed services sector and restricted access to broadband Internet. The rural development policy’s objectives in addressing these challenges are to increase the agricultural and forestry sector’s competitiveness, develop rural areas and the environment, and encourage the rural economy to diversify.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Bearing in mind these priorities, based on the powers which the REGI Committee has, as part of this report, I support:</p>
      <p sl="ro">1. maintaining a balance between environmental protection and the needs in terms of local development;</p>
      <p sl="ro">2. getting national, regional and local representatives involved in national rural networks;</p>
      <p sl="ro">3. encouraging the creation of online e-counselling platforms for farmers using broadband and, last but not least:</p>
      <p sl="ro">4. ensuring the compatibility of EAFRD aid with the objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has had comprehensive powers of codecision with regard to agricultural legislation. This fact gives Parliament new rights which we must and will exercise. To summarise, the results of this are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we will ensure that as many areas as possible are regulated by basic acts and that the provisions are clear, in order to give farmers the greatest possible security to plan ahead.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we will make sure that there is flexibility in regulatory cases by using delegated acts to avoid overburdening the basic acts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, in the case of justified exceptions, we will allow technical details to be amended using implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly and most importantly, this means that we will fight to exercise our rights and duties as a democratic body and colegislator. I am calling on the Council to give up its inflexible approach and to accept delegated acts in regulations and amendments. This is not about political decision making, but about the competence of Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is very important, as are the decisions that we are taking. We are discussing purely technical solutions following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are, however, on the eve of a reform of the common agricultural policy and our decisions regarding the measures to be contained in delegated acts and those to be contained in implementing acts will determine how we implement the common agricultural policy in the future. They will also determine whether the focus of our discussions will be technicalities or substantive issues. The European Parliament would, however, favour discussion on specific measures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During our previous debate today, we demonstrated that we are on the side of farmers, that we fight for their interests, for direct payments and for the common agricultural policy. We are on your side, Commissioner. The significant role played by the European Parliament serves not only to defend the Treaty of Lisbon, but also, first and foremost, to defend the interest of farmers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should also be noted that it is not possible to make a clear-cut distinction between delegated acts and implementing acts. The Commissioner has pointed out that certain measures have already been added to delegated acts. For my part, I would like to emphasise that this is not a political decision but a strictly legal one. Such a decision can always be contested before the Court of Justice. This, in turn, would mean that should measures be used that infringe the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon, then the entire legislative package would be suspended and would cease to function. In such a case, farmers would not be able to benefit from the common agricultural policy or from numerous measures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore appeal for a return to the original measures proposed by the European Commission, which were well prepared and which adhered to the letter of the law. Subsequently, as a result of the Council’s intervention, you have backed away from a number of measures, which is regrettable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, along with my colleague, Paolo De Castro, and others, I have had the misfortune to have been involved in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission on the horizontal file for over 18 months and under three different presidencies of the Council, and to date, we have little progress to show for all the effort that we have put in.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the heart of the problem is the Council’s view that every decision on secondary legislation should be made through implementing acts rather than delegated acts. I must remind the Council, although there is no one representing them here tonight to hear this debate, that implementing acts should be used solely for the purpose of the uniform application of non-essential elements of policies across the EU. However, the Council’s position seems to be that Parliament should have no say whatever over what the Commission does in secondary legislation. The Council’s position seems to be that we have no say; they have no recognition that Lisbon has changed the game, that power must now be shared, and that it is not business as usual.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission proudly claims that it is the guarantors of the Treaties, yet time after time in the negotiations on alignment, the Commission ends up siding with the Council and denying Parliament its rights under codecision. The Commission should be sticking up for the rights of Parliament and defending the correct interpretation of the Lisbon Treaty provisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, tonight I hear what you say about being sympathetic to our cause, but that is not borne out by our experience in the negotiations so far. Tonight, I think it is crystal clear from this debate that this Parliament will fight tooth and nail during the CAP negotiations to protect our powers under Lisbon, even if that means holding the final agreement on CAP reform to ransom until the Council and the Commission agree to a sensible compromise on this key issue of recognising this Parliament’s role in colegislation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, while the issue of alignment of the Lisbon Treaty is perhaps not the most riveting issue going through the committee at the moment, especially considering our work on the CAP reform, it is nonetheless very important. I commend the work of the rapporteurs who have worked on these dossiers. It is quite clearly extremely complex and a subject with legal difficulties. I think we recognise that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although we have not been able to reach agreement, the issue must be dealt with in the CAP reform. The vote tomorrow will provide a clear position for the Parliament side. We have to recognise that there is clearly a growing void between the Commission and Parliament. Granting powers to the European Parliament is one of the aspects of the Lisbon Treaty which I totally support.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of delegated acts, I am in favour of Parliament being given more control and influence because this takes that control into the hands of Parliament and elected representatives. However, I urge Parliament to use these powers, and I have no doubt it will. Especially under the leadership of the current chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, we would use those powers wisely and at least it would be more democratic.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the term ‘implementing act’ is enough to send the layman fast asleep. If I shouted out ‘Commission power grab’, he might wake up. The Lisbon Treaty was another remorseless shift in the removal of democracy; it is little surprise to me that the Commission is pushing things to the limit and it is clear why the EU was so desperate to avoid referendums on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here tonight, we are completing the tidying-up exercise of taking a handful of issues that were still being discussed under the old pre-Lisbon regime. One of these is organic farming. This must be one of the most pampered industries in the entire world. There are generous grants to convert into it; organic farmers have exclusive access to generously paying environmental schemes; and they are, I understand, exempt from the inconvenience of the greening measures that other farmers must endure. Despite this, the end product is still more expensive to the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today is 3 July, and a feed compounder in Britain today is having to pay GBP 200 to have a tonne of wheat delivered to his mill. This fact alone should concentrate the minds of political leaders into removing obstructions for real farmers, rather than playing around with implementing acts and organic farming.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Treaty of Lisbon increases the competences of the European Parliament and this requires specific adjustments. Inter alia , it involves identifying, in the current regulations, the implementing and delegating powers granted to the Commission under Article 290 and Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The adjustment to the Treaty of Lisbon is certainly not a technical procedure. In actual fact, it is a struggle for power between the three institutions. The discussion about the application of Article 43(3) of the Treaty or the division of acts into implementing acts and delegating acts are examples of this struggle. I believe that all important issues concerning the common agricultural policy should be contained in the basic act, in order for the legislators, namely Parliament and the Council, to have a direct influence on the shaping of the provisions. In fact, in order to view the full picture of CAP reform, it is necessary to be acquainted with the nature of the delegated acts and implementing acts to be presented by the Commission. The devil is quite often in the detail. I therefore appeal to the European Commission to present the outline of these acts as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to say that Members should be better informed and should be included in the negotiation process with the Council and the Commission. Currently, it is rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs who make all decisions during a trialogue. We need greater transparency. The trialogue should be open to interested Members serving on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, though they would not, of course, have voting rights.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before talking about the content, we must talk about the technical side of things and adapt the decision-making tool since, as others have said before me, particularly Mr De Castro, Mr Lyon and Mr Capoulas Santos, the Council has a tendency to avoid delegated acts, which limits Parliament’s power and, consequently, is at odds with the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following the vote within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), Parliament must reaffirm the power conferred on us by the Treaty, which is only fair when we are talking about the only integrated policy of the European Union – which has been in place for 50 years, as this year is its anniversary – which still accounts today for close to 40% of the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By granting more powers to Parliament, the Treaty of Lisbon restores balance in favour of democracy. We can no longer allow the ‘obstruction’ of the Council – for we should indeed call it an obstruction – which seems to be curled up with its privileges from the ‘old system’ from before the Treaty of Lisbon. This cannot go on any longer and I am pleased with the position that we will take in this Parliament, but also with the position that you have taken, Commissioner, for I think that, politically, in this battle, you must clearly be on our side as regards the pure and simple application of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with my colleague’s report on rural development where it introduces some appreciable elements of simplification such as the reduction in the number of annual progress and summary reports. Under the heading of rural development is the change to the rules on using advisory services, which should help to reduce the administrative burden for Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also agree with Mr De Castro on the need not to exclude support for producer associations in the fruit and vegetable sector, as part of measures to support the establishment and administration of producer associations.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur for the regulation on organic production and labelling of organic products, I would congratulate Mr Häusling on the balanced way in which he led the trialogue on its necessary alignment with the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, regarding implementing acts or delegated acts, the very issue which delayed reaching a consensus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Council remains unwavering with regard to Articles 16 and 21, claiming that authorisation on specific substances constitutes an implementing act, and not a delegated act, as Parliament legitimately claims, based on Article 290(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission began by supporting Parliament’s claim, but then adopted the position of the Council. To break the deadlock, Parliament proposed that a list of substances be inserted in the annex to the basic act, which was also rejected. The bulk of Parliament’s other proposals were consensual.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, and because the dispute that occurred in this trialogue is common to other reports by Parliament, it is important to progress to voting for the plenary at first reading, even without consensus, in order to demonstrate our determination in this matter and gain support and political strength for today and for the future. Second, it is important to promote a solution to this recurring problem at the highest level of Parliament, as it is a problem for various Parliament committees and burdensome for the public.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, it is highly regrettable that, despite the numerous trialogue negotiations resulting, in particular, from the outstanding horizontal questions, it was not possible for us to come to an agreement with the Council. These negotiations have now been going on for years and everyone has put a lot of time and effort into them. The fact that they have failed ultimately means that they have not achieved their purpose. This was primarily about bringing the technical area involving a formal amendment under the Treaty of Lisbon to a conclusion before the actual negotiations on the future of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to make one thing clear to the Council. Parliament has clearly demonstrated its readiness to compromise during the many negotiations. However, I have not seen the same readiness on the part of the Council, in so far as it was possible to negotiate at all, because there was often no negotiating mandate from the Council. I definitely do not want to make any conjectures, but if anyone believes that this central area in the negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy has been neglected by Parliament, then they are deceiving themselves. We will confirm the position of the committee tomorrow in plenary and we will start the negotiations on the common agricultural policy with a clear mandate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to debate these four reports tonight because they highlight the important role of the European Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations on CAP reform. It will act and impact on the lives of many European citizens and, as such, it is important – imperative even – that the citizens’ representatives can speak and implement changes on their behalf.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Lisbon Treaty envisioned a scenario where a greater role would be given to this institution. However, the Council and the Commission are constantly seeking to circumvent this role, something which is evidenced in the phenomenon of delegated acts turning into implementing acts, and we really have to fight this encroachment on our role.</p>
      <p sl="en">I, like many other MEPs, have held public meetings around my constituency and sought the opinion of stakeholders on the CAP post-2013 and I have met many people who have lots of worries about it. But European citizens expect their opinions to be reflected in the legislation which comes from the European institutions and, as such, the role of Parliament is paramount.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened carefully to your various comments. I would like to highlight what I said in my introduction and, in particular, respond to Mr Lyon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will support Parliament every time it is legally possible to do so, in accordance with Articles 290 and 291. Article 290 states that delegated acts are applied to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act. Article 291, as you have said, gives the Commission the unique opportunity to ensure the uniform application of basic acts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the spirit in which we are working and it is the same spirit that I hope we will work in to find definitive formulas and an agreement. Mr Nicholson, who is no longer here, spoke about the growing tensions between Parliament and the Commission. In any case, I can assure you that I will not fuel these tensions. I think that it is in everyone’s interests – those of both farmers and European consumers and citizens, as Mr Olejniczak said – to reach an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the regulations on organic farming, which Ms Patrão Neves mentioned, I am ready to find a solution which includes Parliament in the procedure concerning the decision on substances. However, we must also evaluate producers’ interest in organic farming. How can we do this without overcomplicating and prolonging the decision-making process for a substance? For this reason, I am proposing a compromise of analysing, within the framework of the adaptation of the basic regulation on organic farming, whether we should now provide more specifically for criteria on the basis of which we could choose whether or not to approve the introduction of a substance. Once these criteria are more precise, following ordinary legislative procedure, and only on the basis of these criteria, the Commission could present implementing acts to limit its role simply to the application of criteria which will already be integrated into the basic act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is also the other possibility that you mentioned of attaching the list of substances as an annex to the basic act, but that means applying ordinary legislative procedure for each substance, which risks considerably delaying the adoption process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we manage to agree on a package of criteria in the basic act for the adoption of these substances, I hope that we will succeed in ensuring that Parliament has its place in this procedure. I propose working on these options in order to find a compromise and I hope that we will find one fairly quickly after tomorrow’s vote.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take advantage of this minute just to thank my colleagues for their comments and also to thank the Commissioner. We take note of the support that the Commissioner has shown today, in the hope that the difficulties of reaching an agreement with the Council on implementing acts do not turn into difficulties of reaching an agreement on common agricultural policy reform. For this reason, I appeal to the Commissioner: we are in the Lisbon era, the Council needs to understand that Parliament has new prerogatives, which it is not prepared to surrender. In tomorrow’s vote, we will be following the Commission’s approach, so we hope that the Council will, in the end, join with us on these positions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this has been a useful debate as various Members have had their say regarding their positions on the alignment of the different regulations to the Treaty of Lisbon, thereby enabling us to confirm in the presence of the Commissioner how much Parliament cares about maintaining its role and prerogatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore clear that in this context, irrespective of tomorrow’s vote – which basically does not diverge significantly from the positions initially raised by the Commission – it is just another step in the direction and along the path we need to travel, not only in order to implement into EU rules all the powers entrusted by the Lisbon Treaty, but also and especially in the direction of the new common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, you well know how many times we have met under different presidencies. You well know how this path, when we got stuck on horizontal issues which ought to have included all the regulations and we had difficulty moving forward, cost us greatly in terms of effort, commitment and time.</p>
      <p sl="it">We now need to set off down this path again. Tomorrow is just an intermediate step in which Parliament, through its vote, wishes once again to clearly express its position and its desire not to surrender its prerogatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the other hand, we must begin to work to ensure that it is not alignment with the Lisbon Treaty, of all the regulations within the common agricultural policy, that prevents approval of the policy itself. We will agree on and debate the contents of the agricultural policy, this Parliament will do its part, but as regards alignment with the Lisbon Treaty, I think we can start work again immediately so as to speed things up.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I would like to thank you once again for explaining to us that you are prepared to compromise. I want to make it clear yet again that this is not a case of Parliament harping on about principles. It is about clear regulations for the future which everyone will have to live with, including the Commission, the Council and Parliament. It is no use reaching compromises that do not last longer than a day. We must make sure that the legal framework for years to come is clearly defined.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is sometimes lacking is trust in the institutions and, perhaps, trust in Parliament on the part of the Council. It was repeatedly said in the negotiations, and you have just said the same thing indirectly, that it could delay the individual legislative procedures. It may be the case that there are occasional delays. However, on the other hand, Parliament’s expertise should not be excluded. For example, we have proposed incorporating the substances into the basic acts in the knowledge that there have only been two amendments in four years, which could have been rubber-stamped by Parliament using a rapid procedure. The concern that Parliament is likely to delay or block the process is unjustified.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must send out a clear signal in first reading that we insist on our rights. This signal must also go out to the Council. We must make it clear that we are not open to persuasion, we will not reach uneasy compromises, and we cannot ultimately allow the lawyers to decide by themselves what we will do. There must be a fair political dialogue involving all the institutions. I would like to thank you specifically for once again offering us a compromise. We will be happy to look into it again. If we can move close enough together on this issue that only a small step is needed, I believe that we will be able to amend this regulation so that everyone agrees with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, it is also about rapidly introducing procedures at this point which accommodate everyone and ensuring that no one can claim that Parliament is blocking progress. We do not want that under any circumstances. However, we must look after our own interests in this context and we will not make a deal that ultimately does not suit us. I would like to make it clear once again that until now, all the compromises have been made by Parliament while the Council has seldom proposed a single one.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Direct payments are one of the most important support mechanisms implemented as part of the common agricultural policy, which itself takes up a significant portion of the EU budget. We should, therefore, ensure that these funds are used appropriately. The aim of modulation is to ensure that the agricultural sector is subsidised in a more effective manner. By reducing direct payments, more funds will be allocated to the support provided under the second pillar, making it possible to increase the number of rural development programmes. I support the adjustment to a lower modulation rate in 10 new Member States, as it will lead to a gradual alignment of these payments, which is key to ensuring equal conditions of competition in the EU’s agricultural market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Direct payments help farmers, but they also benefit consumers. Thanks to direct payments, food prices are not only more stable, they are now, most importantly, lower. Payments should be made to farmers and not to landowners, since that is the way to ensure that best use is made of these payments. It is essential to determine the level of the crisis reserve for the years 2014-2020, intended to protect the food sector. In the coming years, financial discipline will be crucial, but it should also be stressed that protection of the food sector is a priority for the Union’s policy. I therefore believe that the planned reserve should at least be maintained at its current level.</p>
