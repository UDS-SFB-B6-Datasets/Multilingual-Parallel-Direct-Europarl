      <p sl="unknown">The next item is report A6-0012/2009 by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2008/2144(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-009" speaker_id="1941" name="Roberta Angelilli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members for their excellent collaboration, which has enabled us, in my opinion, to draft a highly satisfactory text. I am also grateful to all the NGOs and institutions that have followed our work closely. Their valuable suggestions have enhanced the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">We set out with two key objectives, the first being to check carefully to what extent the 2003 framework decision is being implemented within the 27 Member States, and the second being to propose improvements as necessary. The fact is that the framework decision must be updated to increase the level of protection for minors, in light of the rise in new and disturbing cases of exploitation linked to new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first of the priorities identified is the fight against sex tourism, which worryingly is on the rise, partly because of lower travel costs. From this point of view, extra-territorial cooperation should be improved and Member States should be asked to rule out the principle of double criminality for crimes concerning the exploitation and abuse of children.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, grooming, that is to say online psychological manipulation with the aim of soliciting children for sexual purposes, should be considered a criminal offence in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thirdly, Member States should be bound to exchange the information contained in criminal records relating to sexual abuse convictions. The aim of this is to categorically eliminate the possibility that perpetrators of sexual abuse could hold jobs that involve contact with children.</p>
      <p sl="it">Among the proposals to be implemented as soon as possible is the launch of the missing child rapid alert system. This system has already been trialled and implemented, although by only a small number of Member States and so only at trial level, but has given excellent results. We therefore need to roll it out across all 27 Member States. It is worth remembering, in fact, that every year in Europe, thousands and thousands of children disappear without trace.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to highlight one further aspect: in general, national legislative authorities must commit to improving protection for child victims during investigations and before and after any court case in which children are involved. This will prevent children from becoming victims twice over, firstly victims of violation, and then victims of media or legal violation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, we have highlighted the need for urgency in criminalising forced marriages, the majority of which concern children.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, Mr President, I believe it is important to ask all Member States to ratify as soon as possible the most recent Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. This is the convention of October 2007, the benchmark representing the most innovative and up-to-date act on child protection.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Angelilli warmly for her remarkable report. I would also like to thank her for the way she has worked with the Commission on a very delicate, sensitive subject about which we feel so strongly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Children are vulnerable and they are entitled to protection in order to ensure their harmonious development. Sexual abuse and the various types of exploitation, especially child pornography, are despicable crimes with deep-seated, long-lasting effects on its young victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a terrible phenomenon whose scale is unknown. Some sources say that between 10 and 20% of children in Europe have suffered one form of sexual attack or another during their childhood.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union has armed itself with legislation on the issue. The framework decision of 2004 establishes a minimum level of harmonisation for national legislations in respect of criminalisation and jurisdiction. Despite the incompleteness of the information, the Commission considered, in a 2007 report, that the framework decision had, in general, been satisfactorily implemented. That, however, is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The development of the Internet is contributing to the proliferation of new threats for our children. Child pornography is one of these and others exist, such as child solicitation, to which Mrs Angelilli has alluded. Sex tourism to third countries for the purposes of abusing children is a reality, whilst it is not unknown for abuse to be committed by individuals who have been convicted in other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States are not satisfied. At the end of 2007, they negotiated a convention with the Council of Europe to introduce a very high standard of protection. In its first year, 20 of the 27 Member States have signed this convention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That said, Parliament is still not satisfied, and Mrs Angelilli's report is evidence of this. Parliament demands better implementation and especially a substantial improvement in the European framework, with a set of features to reinforce the fight against these crimes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must say that I am not satisfied either. I have announced a review of the existing European legislation on the issue and will submit a proposal for adoption by the Commissioners in March. I want to put an ambitious text on the table that will deal not only with enforcement but also protection for victims and prevention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The suggestions contained in the report will help us to implement this proposal. Most of the report’s contents should find a place in the new framework decision, but if this proves not to be possible, for technical or legal reasons, we will try to identify the most suitable tools to implement any proposals left out of this framework decision. We will see if there is a possibility for political initiatives, particularly to use dialogue with third countries, or even to provide ourselves with financial instruments, as is the case for the existing programmes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There you have it. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to note Parliament’s desire to move forward with the adoption of ‘kidnap warning’ mechanisms in each Member State. I have to say, at the last meeting of the interior and justice ministers, I argued with much determination that it was necessary to provide each of the Member States with a ‘kidnap warning’ system. To be fully effective, these systems would, of course, have to be interconnected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its determined commitment. I also thank Mrs Angelilli, who has unquestionably given us a high quality report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new proposal submitted by the Commission is urgently needed. The members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality have specific questions and suggestions relating to the proposal. It is essential that we go beyond the confines of the Daphne Programme and introduce legislative initiatives in the area of child pornography. Of course, this is also the responsibility of the users, but the states must take action. For example, I believe that Europol is an important tool which, combined with an effective network of experts and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues, can be used to combat child pornography and prostitution. We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by taking a joint European approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need more background information in the form of concrete studies on the social situation of the victims, because family members themselves are often responsible for abusing children and putting them on the net. It is important for us to make definite progress in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that the Commission is prepared to work closely with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality so that we can resolve these questions together.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-012" speaker_id="23866" name="Edit Bauer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Europol’s organised crime report of 2006 stated that the advantages the Internet offers in terms of information and communication technology are extremely beneficial to organised crime. There is no doubt, in this regard, that children are the most vulnerable group. According to experts, around 90% of 12 to 17 year-olds chat on the Internet. Besides classmates and games, they use ‘unknown user’ networks via chat rooms on websites, which are perfect contact points for paedophiles using false identities to lure potential victims.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to Internet Watch Foundation, which processed more than 30 000 reports in 2006, 91% of victims were under 12 years old. Eighty per cent were female, and child abuse domains totalled more than 3 000. Moreover, 55% of all child abuse domains were hosted in the United States, 28% in Russia and only 8% in Europe. It would be appropriate to put cooperation in the field of disabling websites abusing children on the agenda of an EU-US meeting.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are witnessing a well-organised international network of paedophiles and organised crimes connected with the sex industry, as stated by Mrs Angelilli. On the other side, the international cooperation of law enforcement authorities is limited. It is almost incredible that eight ratifications are still missing in the case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; four in the case of the Palermo Protocol, which is the basic document for international cooperation in combating trafficking in human beings. Slightly less than half of the Member States have still not ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this field there is a lot to do. Therefore, it is time to send a strong and clear message to the Council to revise the Council framework decision combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.</p>

    <intervention id="2-013" speaker_id="28129" name="Inger Segelström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Angelilli and everyone else for their very constructive cooperation. You will surely remember how little was done at the beginning of this parliamentary term, but with the children’s strategy a year ago, the issue of children’s rights turned a corner. The decision we are to make here now concerns a child’s right not to be sexually abused and the combating of child pornography.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am, of course, particularly happy with the three proposals that I managed to get accepted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and which I hope will be retained through the vote today. The first proposal is that a child should be classed as such until he or she is 18 years old. It is very important to be able to protect both young girls and young boys against sexual crimes, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The second proposal is to protect children against child sex tourism by all Member States criminalising sexual crimes both within and outside the EU. This means that those who commit crimes will never be able to be sex tourists and exploit the poorest and youngest children and young people in other countries because prosecution and punishment will await them when they arrive home, wherever that is in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The third proposal is that we should now seriously tackle the Internet and, together with the largest credit companies, develop the technical means, with the help of banks and exchange bureaux, Internet service providers and search engine providers and, of course, the travel industry, to close down payment systems when payment is made for sex crimes and violations or the sexual exploitation of children and young people. The same opinions are found everywhere where people are striving to get websites closed down and that is that children come before confidentiality and that the abuse of children and young people must be reported.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With this report we can now sit back and be satisfied that, here in Parliament, we have taken the first step in respect of the rights of children, and when we get a new Treaty of Lisbon, children’s rights will also be a legal basis and a goal within the EU, and this is not before time. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts and her initiative on this report. Protecting children while they are using the Internet and combating child pornography are two of the most urgent issues which we have to deal with. For me, it is very important to ensure that this Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography offers a higher level of protection. The abuse of children over the Internet can only be handled as a joint initiative at a European level, because the Internet is not subject to national boundaries.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are three points in this report which I believe are in need of improvement. Firstly, a balance must be maintained between children’s security and data protection. We must take into consideration not only children’s personal data, but also the personal data of people and content which is relevant for the purpose of providing this protection for children. As well as creating criminal offences for Internet users and suppliers of child pornography, we must first identify the people behind these dreadful activities and arrest them. We can only combat this abuse successfully by attacking it at the roots. We must also target those people who make these services, these appalling criminal activities, available to others and who profit from them.</p>
      <p sl="de">As well as criminalising the offenders, as described in Mrs Angelilli’s report, we must also raise awareness among people who look after children and explain the risks involved in Internet use. We must focus on developing new technological methods and establishing the principle of privacy by design. In addition, we must promote the exchange of information and experiences between the individual authorities in the Member States. The data protection authorities in the Member States can act as important intermediaries in this respect. Only an all-embracing approach will be successful.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I do not approve of making Internet service providers into an extension of the law enforcement agencies. A much better solution is the implementation of agreements which allow Internet service providers to collaborate with the law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis, as is already the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">Child pornography in all its manifestations is no more and no less than a crime against humanity. We must put every effort into combating it. We must ensure that the Member States cooperate with us and that we in Parliament are all moving in the same direction. On this basis, the members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support Mrs Angelilli’s report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, although the legal systems of Member States make provision for sanctions against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, it is still necessary to raise the level of protection of our children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be emphasised that children who use new technologies, and especially the Internet, are at risk of contact with potential perpetrators of sexual offences. In connection with the danger which exists, Member States should be called upon to block access to Internet sites which contain child pornography. This must be a legally binding obligation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is also an urgent need to carry out a Europe-wide campaign to make parents and teenagers aware of the dangers of child pornography on the Internet. Supporting the victims of this reprehensible business, and of their families, is also an important matter. They are often left without help. It is our obligation to give the best possible protection to our children.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank Ms Angelilli for this report. I would echo what has been said by our colleague, Ms Bauer, in terms of our own Member States taking action to sign and ratify some of the conventions and protocols which are missing at the moment. If we are looking for a common framework and a common approach, these are very key reference points which also help to send a signal from Member States that they, too, are concerned about these issues. I think this is one of the key things they should be doing, and it would be interesting to know why certain Member States have not yet actually signed up to the relevant conventions and protocols.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome much of the report in terms of the rights-based approach, which I would like to see leading on and away from the view that it is only about criminal justice. This is actually about the rights and the protection of children and young people. We need those clear measures to support children who have been victims – whether through court proceedings, where obviously the key issue is to find the truth but not in a way that leaves children more traumatised than they were at the beginning of the process, or through the collective work on identifying children.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the protection also has to involve the children themselves. We should encourage Internet literacy among children as well their own understanding of what the dangers are and what they should be looking for so that they, too, can play an active part in helping to combat these crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">We intend to support certain of the amendments this morning, particularly where we think there are certain principles which we tamper with at our peril – such as on double criminality and confidentiality in certain professions – and one or two others where we think the concept perhaps needs further definition. We are, however, generally very much in favour of this report and look forward to its further progress.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017" speaker_id="28134" name="Eva-Britt Svensson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="sv">This report has the support of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. The sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are abhorrent crimes, the prevention of which requires international cooperation. Children are violated by being forced to pose in sexual contexts, photographed or filmed and posted on the Internet. These films and images can be seen all over the world and increased international cooperation is therefore needed to stop these violations. We know that there are definite connections between the sex slave trade and the sexual exploitation of children. The United Nations estimates that 85% of the victims of the sex slave trade are children under the age of 18.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We do not know how many children are bought and sold as commodities to be sexually exploited, but we do know that it is a lot, and we know that every child that is affected is one child too many. The adult world must take responsibility for protecting our children from this, one of the worst crimes that a child can be subjected to.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this debate, we must not forget that many of the crimes against children are committed within the family or within the family’s circle of friends and it is therefore important for society to ensure that children have other adult contacts so that they have someone they can turn to for help.</p>
      <p sl="sv">All kinds of sexual abuse of children are criminal and must be seen as the crimes that they are in all Member States. All citizens who commit sexual crimes against children must be punished, regardless of whether the crime is committed within or outside the EU.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I should like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli on this lucid report. It is patently obvious that the sexual exploitation of children should be brought to an end. The explosive increase in criminal activities via the Internet requires a coordinated approach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should, however, exercise caution when it comes to prescribing detailed sentences for this abuse at European level. The Member States themselves will need to make every effort to penalise the abuse of modern media. Internet child porn will need to be regulated in the Member States’ criminal law. The Council should, in line with the prohibition against pursuing one’s profession, commit to closing the loopholes in the legal network, so that exploitation and transmission via the Internet do not move to countries where there is no adequate legislation. I would have liked to hear from the Commission whether it would also be possible to discuss this with non-EU countries, but the Council is absent, unfortunately.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, I would like to argue in favour of strengthening cooperation with Europol and Eurojust. The fight against international child pornography networks must be given priority in their organisations, as indeed, this enhances the scope for taking appropriate action outside of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we are agreed on the undesirability of the sexual exploitation of children, I suggest we also discuss the exploitation of adults. The initiatives to reduce prostitution at large-scale events, such as football championships and Olympic Games, deserve more support in this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, paedophile organisations are a threat to citizens and, as such, should be treated like mafia or terrorist organisations, with special, severe laws.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is an outrage that there are thousands of people who have been charged with child pornography offences and have spent not so much as a single day in prison. I would also like to remind the rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, the quality of whose work we have all admired, that in her city last year, there was a case known as ‘Lotus flower’, involving 200 Roma children. Once the case was over, these Roma children virtually disappeared; no one knows whether they in fact went back to the same camps where the abuse took place.</p>
      <p sl="it">All Member States must therefore be vigilant, special legislation must be introduced, and this outrage, this horrible threat to society, must be addressed with special and extremely severe laws.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House is debating a topic today which rightfully outrages all people of good will. We condemn the phenomenon, and then believe that such trauma can only happen to other people’s children. Yet all our children are in danger, as the victims of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography multiply. We must therefore fight to prevent such acts using all available means. We must ensure that the sanctions laid down in national legal systems are effectively applied, and that daily practice reflects this struggle. Member States must do everything possible to eliminate demand entirely.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We must be particularly vigilant regarding the constant challenge posed by the use of new online technologies – web cams, mobile phones and, in particular, the use of the Internet – in this regard. The introduction of technologies that block access can be one way of doing this, besides making families and children aware of the dangers. In any case, we must emphasise that these are serious crimes, and that in order to detect them, it is essential to remove any obstacles in the way of the smooth exchange of law enforcement records among Member States, to allow the creation of centralised databases for information on offenders.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I consider it very important and absolutely essential that the existing international documents be ratified by the Member States, and that their contents be effectively implemented. We must make sure that child safety becomes a central issue in all EU Member States. Mrs Angelilli’s excellent report contributes to this effort, and we support it with our vote as well.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, sexual exploitation is a reality endured by boys and girls all over the world, since there is a supply of child sexual exploitation, particularly in poor countries, and a demand for Internet pornography and sex tourism on the part of rich countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">With this recommendation, we advocate that real steps be taken: we request European harmonisation of differences in the age of consent; tougher punishments for sexual abuse; and stronger, increased national intervention programmes and systems. To achieve this, we must focus attention on Member States so that – as Spain has done, beyond transposing the Council’s framework decision on this matter, – we can develop and implement action plans in which interest groups are involved, including public awareness and social mobilisation programmes, without neglecting to work on international cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Angelilli, ladies and gentlemen, the rapid development of information and communication technology has created a new channel for criminals to perpetrate or present their crimes. The crimes that are the subject of the report have been discussed in various global and European forums.</p>
      <p sl="et">In 2003, the Council of the European Union passed a binding framework resolution on the sexual exploitation of children and the struggle against child pornography, and the contents of that resolution have today largely been integrated into Member States’ legal systems. However, in connection with the rapid development of IT, it needs to be brought up to date and, of course, we cannot drag our feet on this. I am glad that the commission will soon have completed a new updated framework resolution.</p>
      <p sl="et">All Member States must define the concept of ‘child pornography’ and declare the sexual solicitation of children through the Internet to be a crime. Harassers operating on the Internet are difficult to catch, but it is not impossible. At the same time, several national laws constrain surveillance. Thus, surveillance cannot be used in the case of second-degree crimes, and data protection is also often an obstruction.</p>
      <p sl="et">In my home country, there have been cases, even recently, where a minor committed suicide due to the activities of an Internet harasser. There have also been such cases in other Member States. We must be able to protect our children before they become victims. There must be zero tolerance for paedophilia and child pornography in the European Union. We must achieve this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sexual exploitation of children is a terrible problem. It is a disgrace of today’s world and a grave sign of our decline.</p>
      <p sl="it">A sharp increase has been observed in recent times, due to the vertiginous spread of the Internet and of new and sophisticated technologies to which children are exposed and to which they have access, without any limits, rules, controls or penalties. These are now more urgently required than ever, and must be applied in an increasingly efficient and exemplary fashion.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Angelilli’s excellent report, on which I warmly congratulate her, and the specific recommendations that Parliament will make to the Commission, indicate and suggest measures that can genuinely curb the spread of child pornography, online grooming of children, sex tourism and all forms of child abuse.</p>
      <p sl="it">Recent disturbing data, including a UN study on violence against children, indicate that sexual exploitation of children is rapidly increasing and that, together with people trafficking, it is becoming one of the major sources of profit and one of the fastest growing crimes at transnational level, with a yearly turnover of approximately USD 10 billion.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to an estimate by the International Labour Organisation, more than 12 million people are victims of forced labour, of whom more than 1 million are involved in sexual exploitation and between 45% and 50% are children.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography in general is prompted by the clear development of new telecommunication technologies.</p>
      <p sl="it">Forms of online grooming of children have certainly increased, but I would like to take this opportunity to denounce the exploitation of images of women also. In the majority of EU countries, an often disgusting view of womanhood is propagated, where the commercial aim is pursued not only with vulgarity but with a real contempt for women’s dignity, not to mention the use of subliminal advertising and also television programming – above all in my country, I have to say.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the rapporteur that Council Framework Decision 2004/68 should be updated to increase the level of protection for children and to better combat sexual exploitation in general. The ratification of the Council of Europe Convention is just as important, but we must not stop there: we also need to criminalise the online grooming of children and press for cross-border cooperation in this field.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, Member States should be obliged to exchange the information contained in criminal records relating to sexual abuse convictions – and I believe that the ECRIS system is certainly a step forward on this front – in order to prevent those who have committed certain crimes from having contact with children and therefore to improve protection for victims, not just during investigations, but also after trials have been concluded.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to close by emphasising that forms of child exploitation unfortunately encompass more than just sexual abuse, and I would like to see a greater commitment from our institutions on those other areas.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli on her exceptional work on such a sensitive issue which concerns us all. The sexual exploitation of children is a phenomenon which continues to shock society in the Member States of the European Union and elsewhere. Child pornography on the Internet is a worsening problem if you think that, between 1997 and 2007, the number of websites showing the sexual exploitation of children increased one thousand per cent. Reinforced cooperation with the private sector could make an effective contribution towards limiting the number of websites hosting child pornography. For example, cooperation could be promoted with credit card companies to fight child pornography on the Internet at European level by using their systems for payments to commercial sites selling photographs of children.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition, the new Community programme to protect children using the Internet will help to promote a safer online environment. The Council of Europe Convention signed by 20 Member States of the European Union is the first international legal act qualifying the various forms of sexual exploitation of children as a criminal offence. In order to deal effectively with this phenomenon, Member States need to criminalise every form of coercion of children to take part in sexual activities. Finally, I consider it very important to take account of paedophile registers and to prohibit them from accessing jobs or voluntary work which brings them into direct contact with minors.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around the world, some 40 million children under the age of 12 are the victims of some form of violent act. Given that the new technologies and, in particular, the constant development of the Internet and the new online methods used by paedophiles, it is of paramount importance that the level of child protection be increased. According to Eurobarometer, 74% of underage children use the Internet on a daily basis, and hence many of them are exposed to violent or pornographic elements.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the interests of effective protection, I would like to recommend the introduction of the so-called free family information packages in Europe. These are already widely used by certain European Internet service providers, and I believe that others can also become partners in this effort. The packages address four basic safety topics – safety and communication, entertainment, downloading, and virtual violence, and, in a playful manner, offer families help with the safe use of the Internet. I further recommend that these packages contain a free, child-friendly Internet browser which could serve as a web filter, to keep children away from undesirable content on the World Wide Web. We must be sure that our children are safe, not only on the Internet, but in public and private institutions as well. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that everyone whose work involves regular contact with children be required to report any situation in which sexual abuse has occurred. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are very serious crimes. Although legislation in many European Union countries is sufficiently stringent, there are still many measures which need to be taken to guarantee children adequate protection. All Member States should ratify the Council of Europe Convention and implement in full the framework decision in order to establish a united approach at European Union level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Illegal material involving child abuse should be removed from the Internet at source and websites should be blocked by providers. Indeed, the telecom legislation review which we are debating at the moment in the European Parliament, along with the Council and Commission, offers a good opportunity to improve the legislation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Perpetrators of sexual abuse should be denied the opportunity to pursue professional activities which involve contact with children. In fact, special orphan homes should be supervised much more closely by the local authorities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I believe that the European Commission and Member States should provide financial and logistical support for the campaigns aimed at parents and children.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am very pleased that Parliament has taken up the question of combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography seriously. I am especially pleased because, until now, many left-wing groups in Europe have been fighting openly for the greatest possible sexual freedom, while not giving attention to the consequences of this course of action in relation to children. There have even been attempts to form paedophile political parties. This must fill every decent citizen of the European Union with horror. The scale of this phenomenon is huge, as can be seen just by looking through the daily papers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Taking the opportunity of this discussion, attention should be drawn to the violation of children’s rights and the sexual exploitation of children of immigrants from outside Europe. The fact that it is permissible in their home countries is one thing, but when they are living in the countries of the European Union, they must rigorously comply with the prevailing law or leave Europe. There cannot be some laws for the traditional peoples of Europe and others for immigrants. This concerns every aspect of life.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly an important issue requiring effective cooperation by all Member States. I would like to point out that the protection of children from abuse in a modern society has weakened in many respects. The reasons range from increasing family breakdown and the growing number of children brought up in single-parent families, to greater mobility of citizens and the spread of modern information technologies. That is why I am strongly in favour of the report.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that frank sex education for children is relevant to the prevention of sexual abuse of children, but it should also be addressed at parents, educators and social and health professionals. It is important that everyone gains a proper awareness of such crimes while acknowledging first of all that they do exist, so that they can detect potential abusers and prevent the abuse.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to draw your attention to the fact that child sex offenders have a high repeat offence rate. To some extent, the adage of our German friends, einmal ist keinmal , applies here. However, if somebody commits such an offence two or more times, then we should be able to prevent them from committing further crimes. In such cases, both therapeutic and various preventive measures should be used, particularly bans on working with children and adolescents. Since extended periods of time can lapse between offences being repeated, information on tendencies to commit such crimes should be kept on record over the long term. I would also recommend the compulsory vetting of persons applying to work as teachers, coaches and youth supervisors for past sex offences.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my experience, child sex offenders often try to circumvent bans on working with children by using various ruses, including false identities, to try to regain access to their targets. The free movement of people in the European Union gives them greater scope for doing so.</p>

      <p sl="en">Sex exploitation of children is a crime against the most vulnerable in our society and I am, therefore, shocked that seven of our Member States in the European Union have still not signed the Council of Europe Convention; nor, indeed, have eight of these states ratified the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that the Internet now provides new routes for these crimes, and I therefore think it is incumbent on us to urge that the acts of using the Internet for child pornography and for grooming children be made a criminal offence. It is not enough for states to plead that this is difficult to do. We have to cooperate and coordinate our efforts in order to ensure we can do it. Indeed, in all Member States, it should be possible for any citizen or person living in the European Union who committed a crime outside the European Union to be brought before the courts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli for her very fine report. I think we will all support such a report.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has been said, it is a crime, and anybody who would attack or in any way undermine children should be treated as criminals. Unfortunately, this is what is going on on the Internet. The Internet is a wonderful tool, a wonderful source of information for all of us and something that will be part of our lives into the future. However, there are those who prey on children and they will use the Internet as much as they possibly can to try to undermine children.</p>
      <p sl="en">About 8 out of 10 children in the European Union use the Internet and I think we must take particular care to protect the most vulnerable children from bullying, grooming and harassment. We need to promote public awareness and online safety, especially among children, but also among parents so that they know exactly what is going on and what can be done on the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think Member States should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach in order to report illegal and harmful content and conduct. It is important that both parents and children feel secure using the Internet and have a point of contact to report any wrongdoing. In order to make those who are responsible for online grooming and pornography accountable, we should see this for what it is. It is a crime and should be treated as such.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen: the 2003 framework decision aimed to narrow the legislative gap between Member States in combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. To this end, it adopted a common framework of provisions to regulate, amongst other things, criminalisation, the applicable sanctions and protection of and assistance to victims. I consider it regrettable that some Member States have yet to adopt the measures necessary for the implementation of this framework decision, even though the deadline for them to do so has already passed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is essential that all Member States criminalise all types of sexual abuse of children and that all European citizens who commit a sex crime against children in any country within or outside the European Union be subject to uniform extraterritorial criminal legislation applicable throughout the Union. It is important to ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes cannot slip through the law’s fingers. I also support the revision of the framework decision so that it guarantees at least the same level of protection as the 2007 Council of Europe Convention. It is regrettable that some Member States have yet to sign this Convention.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is also important to strengthen this framework decision in response to the most recent technological developments in the field of communication. Children make ever greater use of the Internet, which has become one of the preferred tools of potential and actual offenders, in particular through the grooming and fraudulent solicitation of children for unlawful purposes to which Mrs Angelilli has already referred. I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and on the report which she has submitted to us.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am aware of the complexity and difficulty of this struggle, but I believe that it is possible to confront the sexual exploitation of children with unified action and a joint effort. The emphasis should be given to prevention, by promoting campaigns to make parents and children aware of the risks of child pornography, specifically on the Internet and, in particular, the risk of sexual exploitation in online chat rooms and forums.</p>

It is disagreement with evil.’ Today we must say ‘no’ to the violation of fundamental children’s rights, ‘no’ to violence and the sexual exploitation of children, ‘no’ to depravity and pornography on the Internet and ‘no’ to sex tourism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore thank Mrs Angelilli for her report. I have raised this subject many times myself. Prophylactic and preventative measures are needed in this area. It is essential to raise awareness of the dangers, both among children and also among their parents and carers. Rapid crime detection and strict enforcement of penalties are imperative. Cooperation is needed from the media. These measures must include the whole world, because in some countries there are organisations which question the penalising of sexual contact with children. Indeed, there are even specious notions about so-called ‘good paedophilia.’ We should not be indifferent to the degradation of our children, or to their pain and humiliation. This is a reproach of our times.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr Vice-President, the recommendation presented so perfectly today by Mrs Angelilli and supported by my fellow members is directed mainly at the Council. However, as you said that you would be tabling your own proposal in March, I should like to ask for this proposal to be in keeping with numerous policies of the European Union and not move in just one direction. This proposal will need to make provision for criminalisation, strict measures and cooperation with Europol, whose convention is the first to mention trafficking in human beings. Let us not forget that, apart from the threats, violence, deception and abuse of dependents, especially within the family, we also have exploitation from deliberate promotion, mainly of people at an age at which they cannot react. I refer to the phenomenon of trafficking in abandoned infants which we have seen emerging on the Internet and, when I say Internet, I mean not just the World Wide Web and the chatrooms which children enter from their bedrooms, but also the numerous other means, including mobiles, which children can use, which is why we need to make provision for all the parameters.</p>
      <p sl="el">When we talk about a criminal offence, we also need to think about the situation in correctional facilities and prisons. If we cut down on the number of people in these institutions, we have an increased risk of such phenomena. Provision also needs to be made for improving the living conditions of victims. We need to protect victims and their families, given that violence by abusers is spreading and the means which they use are stronger than the means of defence available to victims, because they are mainly economic. I trust therefore that your new proposal will feature a stronger level of protection for minors and high-specification means.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Angelilli’s report will help all parents to protect their children from paedophiles who prowl the Internet. We should remember that all the support we receive in the form of filters and monitoring service suppliers on the Internet does not relieve us, as parents, from our obligation to protect and warn our children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I live in a small village, where people know each other and are interested in what is happening around them. A stranger arouses interest. In a small village in the south of Poland it would be difficult for someone to make contact with the children unnoticed, but I venture to say that in just such peaceful and safe places all over Europe, when the parents are quietly reading the newspaper or watching television, an unwanted stranger is in their children’s bedroom, and has made contact with them over the Internet. Are we, as parents, helpless? No, we are not. Perhaps our children are more proficient in using the new technologies. Perhaps it is difficult to get them away from their computers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Dear parents, do something today to protect your children. Remind them of something we were taught, namely: ‘do not talk to strangers.’ It is such a simple message. Today, those strangers are not lurking outside the school with a bag of sweets, they enter Internet chat rooms and seek their victims there. They are more dangerous, because we do not see when they slip without difficulty from one child’s bedroom to another. We should teach our children that they must not talk to strangers, and likewise on the Internet, shut the door in their face.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is such political agreement on this issue that it seems strange that so little is happening in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our focus on the Internet is obviously very important, but it suggests that this problem is a new one, when we clearly know that it is a very old problem and was very well hidden. It happened not just outside schools with bags of sweets, but it happened in homes, in all of our Member States, in churches and in hospitals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Internet has perhaps shone a light on this very dark part of society which we are still grappling with, and grappling very badly with. It is very urgent that Member States take seriously their many fine words about protecting children, just as we in this House have spoken very much about how we value and protect children, whereas in fact, our actions are often much weaker than the strong words we speak.</p>
      <p sl="en">I mentioned that the home is sometimes the most dangerous place for children. We had a recent case in Ireland which highlighted this. I would also add that those who believe that small towns, where everyone knows one another, are a safe place for children, need to think again. In small towns, people very often close their eyes because they do not want to speak about ‘soft information’ that they have, and are perhaps afraid to pass it on to the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is something that we all need to look at and be prepared to speak about, because silence causes abuse to grow, and causes awful damage to the children who are caught in that situation. I call on the Irish Government to bring forward legislation on a wide range of measures to protect children against sexual abuse. I think we also need to look at our Constitution, which puts the family before the rights of the child. They should not be in conflict: both deserve protection from our Constitution.</p>

I propose that such a listing should be permanent, with no possibility of anyone’s name being erased from it unless there has been a court decision reversing the original conviction. A sexual offence against a child causes permanent damage to the victim and should also result in permanent labelling of the perpetrator.

Realistically, it is impossible to prove this within a family where there is also an exceptional right to remain silent. Secondly, the provision on overriding professional confidentiality would need to be worked out in more detail. Regardless of these two reservations, I appeal to the Member States, the Council and the Commission, including the Czech Presidency, to urgently update the relevant European and national legislation and to ratify international agreements for effectively combating paedophilia. A Europe-wide database of paedophiles must be set up as soon as possible to prevent these people from being employed in education or child services in other Member States.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I believe this debate has shown the European Parliament’s unanimous commitment to the protection of children.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am trying to be as clear as I can: I would point out that we are going to review the framework decision dealing with child protection. We wish to improve its contents to bring child protection in the European Union up to the level of the highest international standards, particularly the new 2007 Council of Europe Convention, and best national practices.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of criminal investigations, the legislative proposal will include new criminal offences to deal with the new forms of abuse which are being facilitated by new technologies. It will be easier to carry out investigations and bring charges. I will say no more on this. As for helping victims, we will make it easier for them to gain access to justice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, and especially, we will organise prevention by managing offenders on the basis of an individual diagnosis and a risk assessment for each offender. In addition, we will try to prevent and minimise the risks of repeat offending and introduce measures to ensure the optimum effectiveness of safety mechanisms in the entire Union. In this respect, the ECRIS system, which will allow the networking of criminal records, will be very valuable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have also had questions on extraterritoriality. We will also take the opportunity to propose more restrictive measures at this level to prosecute crimes of sexual exploitation committed in third countries by citizens of EU countries, even if the third country in which the crime is committed is unable to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the current thinking. Obviously, Mrs Angelilli, we will follow all the recommendations in your report most carefully as we develop this framework directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say to Parliament that it is not enough to have a good legal framework. There is also a need for tools. This is why, at European level, around Europol, we are trying to build a platform which can be used to bring together information gathered in the Member States and distribute reports and statistics from the national platforms. Several EU countries have such platforms, but now there is a need at Community level to ensure that everyone can be familiar with all this information. In this matter, the European Union can offer added value, provided that we can succeed in creating this platform around Europol.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also say that we have a further tool in which I have a lot of faith, in other words, the informal public-private group created by the Commission, which has introduced a European financial coalition against commercial child pornography images. In the face of a quadrupling in the number of sites between 2003 and 2007, we have to involve the private sector, as it controls a large part of the IT infrastructures. In particular, the access providers have to be mobilised. This is fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The coalition will bring together all of the stakeholders: non-governmental organisations, banks, companies that issue credit cards, online payment organisations, Internet service providers and other private operators with an Internet presence. It will set about locating and confiscating the profits made from criminal activities. This is a major factor in bringing an end to a number of commercial practices which are exploiting such child pornography.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, in brief, is my answer, Madam President, but we will have occasion to return to this major issue. I would add that, last week, we had a very nice data protection day. It saw youngsters sending out remarkable warnings to other young people to be careful when they use the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are aware that there are now an increasing number of monitoring mechanisms that families can use to make the Internet safer for children to use. I am not saying that things are perfect, but a major effort is being made and, of course, we need to mobilise the entire Internet community.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to stress the concept of ‘kidnap warnings’, because they have not been the subject of many speeches. It really is important for Parliament to encourage the Member States, as it did in its declaration of 2 September 2008, to arm themselves with warning systems and to conclude cooperation agreements to achieve cross-border trigger mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, you have also very generously created a budget line to encourage Member States to create these mechanisms, or at least to create links between themselves to deal with ‘kidnap alerts’. We know that a ‘kidnap alert’ can be very effective if it is triggered quickly. Now, before the European Parliament, I would lay particular stress on the horror that is child kidnapping, often carried out for the purposes of pornography.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would again like to thank the European Parliament for its support in the struggle to protect children. I would also add that I have noted the speeches on data protection during legal procedures involving children. I cannot go on any longer, but I would stress that in March, we will attempt to give the European Union an exemplary legal framework in accordance with the most stringent standards of child protection.</p>

Too often we lack sufficient data, statistics, which are indispensable as a basis for our work in better monitoring, better understanding and, of course, better combating child abuse. This lack of data is – how can I put it – a recurring issue, but I think it important to emphasise since it is a shortcoming that we must overcome.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as data protection is concerned, some Members raised this topic and the Commissioner has already given them a very specific response. I would like to stress that I am very aware of data protection and I do not believe that there is a conflict between privacy and children’s rights, if, of course, the institutions play their part and if everyone, from the providers to the police, respects the rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, I would point out that children are, in fact, those with the greatest need for privacy and data protection. Mr Barrot mentioned this too: often during legal proceedings, when a scandal breaks in which the victim is sadly a child, it is precisely the exploited child that is fed to the media without any form of protection, and I would say without any compassion either for their image or for their privacy, and all simply to boost television ratings and sell a few more newspapers. I would also like to add that no child is exempt from these dangers, and unaccompanied children and Roma children are often even more vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will conclude, Madam President, by saying that clearly a significant effort is needed at a cultural and political level, and this effort must be made by families, schools and the media. Much can be done in terms of self-regulation, but without binding, weighty legislative instruments, clearly, we cannot fight cases of exploitation behind which there are not only individuals but often actual criminal organisations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">One of the features of sexual abuse of children has been its rapid spread with the help of the Internet, making it all the more difficult to combat. It must become a legal obligation to block access to websites which spread child pornography. Indeed, grooming children must be considered an offence.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We need to be much more aware of the risk of new technologies being used by paedophiles at a time when children are becoming increasingly more active in their use of the Internet. We cannot help but be concerned by the gap that exists between generations in terms of Internet usage and, by extension, in terms of controlling children’s access to websites posing a high level of risk.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is extremely important to establish communication between the school and family in order to educate children in how to identify risk situations and respond. This is the reason why special information and education programmes are useful, not to mention a European strategy for combating sexual abuse and more active cooperation between Member States aimed at setting up a transnational police network for tackling child pornography and prostitution, as well as a network for managing a database containing the details of people convicted of such acts.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report recognises that the violation of a child’s dignity is a serious breach of human rights, as well as a despicable act, which, unfortunately, is not tackled uniformly throughout the EU. It is disturbing that some Member States have not implemented all relevant international conventions for the protection of children. I urge the Commission to use all tools at its disposal to pressure those states into compliance.</p>
      <p sl="en">To fight child pornography, the EU should enforce tough legislation, but also undertake educational projects that inform people about this subject. Existing technical solutions to protect children should be promoted among parents, in particular, software tools that are easy to use and available for free or at a low-cost.</p>
      <p sl="en">Low barriers of entry and minimal risk are making it very easy for criminal organisations to get into cyberspace. To face this new threat, we need to harmonise legislation, boost law enforcement and strengthen cooperation in police work. Moreover, EU legislation would only partially solve the problem since this issue has a global dimension and therefore needs a global framework to enforce the law internationally. In that regard, I urge the EU to take the lead.</p>

      <p sl="en">Exploiting children in any way is unacceptable. Being the future of any society, children are, at the same time, the most vulnerable group of it. Therefore it is the priority duty of politicians to protect children from any abuse, in particular, to free them of the risks of sexual abuse.</p>
      <p sl="en">I warmly welcome the comprehensive report which calls upon all Member States to address the problem in question with utmost seriousness.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the call to the seven Member States which have not yet signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. Furthermore, I join the call upon all Member States to sign, ratify and implement all relevant international conventions to protect our children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, signing and ratifying conventions is merely providing a framework for improvement. Practical actions are needed because of the increasing evidence of sexual exploitation of children. Children need to grow up in a safe environment for which parents have the primary responsibility.

      <p sl="et">In order to prevent crimes, one must increase awareness. The 2008 Eurobarometer study shows that a large percentage of parents do not pay attention to what their children are doing on the Internet. I, for instance, represent a country where Internet use is among the highest in the EU, but parents’ disregard is also among the highest in the EU.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0026/2009) by Claudio Fava on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-053" speaker_id="4469" name="Claudio Fava" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, four minutes will be enough to give you a summary of two years’ work – work that has been hard but, I hope, useful – which has involved Parliament alongside both the Commission, with its proposal, and the Council. The essence of this work has been to prepare a directive which, for the first time, lays down sanctions for employers who benefit from the work of illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe we have succeeded in changing the philosophy behind this directive, which had been confined solely to fighting illegal immigration. The compromise text agreed with the Council also provides some protection for those immigrants forced to work illegally, who are often held hostage by criminal organisations. Otherwise, Madam President, there would have been a risk of punishing them twice over, both as exploited workers, often forced to accept indecent working conditions, and as illegal immigrants who have to be repatriated, with the repatriation ban which, in many countries, means years and years.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, in Articles 7 and 14, we have provided that, in cases involving minors, serious exploitation or people trafficking, the Member States will be obliged to draw up rules for issuing temporary residence permits, the term of which may be extended until any remuneration due has been paid. We should have liked this possibility to be extended to all illegal immigrants, but that is prevented by the Return Directive adopted last year. I was not one of those who supported it.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have, however, succeeded in introducing a rule allowing Member States to apply more favourable measures to immigrants regarding the issuing of residence permits. Article 10 is, in my view, the key article. For the first time, it provides for criminal sanctions to be imposed in the worst cases, including those where the regular workers are minors.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think the additional sanctions laid down in Article 8 are important. They include withdrawal of licences, closure of establishments in particularly serious cases, and exclusion from state aid derived from European funding. Otherwise, we would be guilty of extraordinary hypocrisy: we would be punishing employers with one hand yet still giving them generous subsidies with the other.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is fundamental that we have succeeded in including a definition of remuneration that equates the pay due to an illegal immigrant with the pay of a regular worker, without any discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have included temporary work agencies in the scope of the directive. In certain countries – such as my own – in particular, these are the organisations that most readily recruit illegal workers under the very worst kinds of exploitative conditions. Just think of the cases where illegal agricultural workers have been hired, which have long filled the crime columns.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have successfully asked for the trade unions to be able to represent immigrants in administrative and civil cases. The text previously mentioned third parties in general, but now it mentions trade unions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need a running-in period to see how it works, and we have therefore asked the Commission to report to Parliament and the Council after the directive has been in force for three years, specifically about the rules on inspections, residence permits, sanctions and subcontracting.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the subject of subcontracting – Article 9, which was the subject of discussion between Parliament and the Council and within the Council itself – your rapporteur would have like to extend liability to the whole contracting chain, as the Commission had originally proposed. The Council and Parliament, or rather part of Parliament, were for excluding subcontracting entirely, but we have reached a compromise solution that I believe is workable: dual liability, which should not prevent us from legislating again on this issue in future. That is why tomorrow, for my part and on behalf of the other shadow rapporteurs, whom I thank for the collaboration they have given me during these two years, I shall ask the Council to add a statement to the compromise text on which we are going to vote, to the effect that the provisions of this Article 9 shall not prejudice any future legislative action on subcontracting.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, Madam President, I believe this directive lets us envisage a Europe in which immigration has finally become a matter of collective responsibility and recognised rights, and not just of rules against immigrants.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would, of course, like to thank Mr Fava and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Major efforts have been made by various parties to reach an agreement at first reading and, given the broad majorities in favour of this on the LIBE Committee several days ago and on the Permanent Representatives Committee just before Christmas, I think we will get there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This text, of course, does not fulfil the initial ambitions in all respects. The Commission can, however, support this compromise without hesitation. This directive lets us introduce an effective instrument, a common framework to discourage the employment of workers from third countries who are residing illegally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will be vigilant about the inspections. The compromise text recommends better targeted, qualitative inspections, so it remains to be seen in the coming years if these qualitative criteria have been used and if the obligation on Member States to regularly identify the risk sectors for illegal working on their territory has been really effective. This is what we want, in order to fight against the employment of people from third countries residing illegally and, above all, to impose sanctions on the employers who profit from these people. Examination of the implementation of the provisions relating to the inspections will, therefore, be a priority for the Commission in its future reports on the application of this directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, there are, of course, positive results emerging from this compromise, particularly the consensus achieved on the difficult question of subcontracting. I have noted that Mr Fava was hoping for a statement from the Council and Parliament. Personally, I do not see any drawbacks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is pleased that the directive recommends criminal sanctions for particularly serious cases, for which these sanctions are both necessary and appropriate. They are necessary to reinforce the deterrent since, in the most serious cases, administrative sanctions are not sufficient to deter unscrupulous employers. They are appropriate in an instrument intended to match the ambitious European policy to combat illegal immigration. In this context, the Commission appreciates the fact that criminalisation of employers of the victims of trafficking has been reinserted in the text in the final compromise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is a first significant step in the fight against illegal immigration. It targets the practices of unscrupulous employers, whilst protecting migrant workers who, most often, are the victims in such cases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This directive should be adopted and implemented quickly. The Commission will support and accompany this process by calling regular meetings of experts from the Member States during the transposition phase to discuss any issues that might arise. It is an important tool and the Commission will do everything necessary to ensure this tool is used effectively.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My thanks go to Parliament, Mr Fava and the LIBE Committee.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is hoped that legislating against employers employing illegal migrants from third countries will be an instrument for reducing the ‘pool-factor’ of illegal migration. However, on the other hand, one can also see its possible effect on improving conditions for competition and I also believe that it will help to combat human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There is a view that this legislation will not bring added value. As no such legislative instrument exists yet at Community level, for some Member States, the added value is high, while for others, where such legislation already exists, the added value may not be evident.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In discussions of possible compromises with the Commission and the Council, the discussions concentrated on particular problem areas. Firstly: the issue of the contractor’s liability for obligations under law on sub-contractors, where the draft proposal limits the liability for the actions of direct sub-contractors. Secondly: the means of ensuring effective procedures by which illegal migrants can be paid outstanding wages where we have pursued the principle of non-discrimination, and we looked for a way to provide available help to illegal migrants and to provide tools for them to receive wages even after their return to their home country. Thirdly: the possible effect of postponing the execution of the return of an illegal migrant until that person receives their wages. Here I would say that postponing the execution of such a decision would greatly undermine and possibly negate the purpose of the proposed legislation. And finally, the problem of inspections has been left to Member States in the knowledge that labour inspectors play a vital role in making the legislation effective.</p>
      <p sl="sk">No doubt there are various views on how to resolve this and other problems in this draft. Some of these will be decided when it comes to their implementation. I would like to finish by thanking Mr Fava, the Commission and the French Presidency for successfully incorporating the compromises.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur for his work, without overlooking the efforts, though, of the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Busuttil, and the social affairs rapporteur, Mrs Edit Bauer. It is, after all, thanks to their efforts that the compromise reached ultimately does what it is supposed to do, namely take away the prospect of work as an incentive for illegal immigration by actually penalising workers who are staying in the European Union illegally.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Contrary to what some parties in this Parliament tried to achieve in the first instance, this legislation has not become an instrument for subsequently legalising illegal immigrants. Indeed, the debate on legal migration is being held elsewhere. As rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I do believe, though, that more thought should be given to gender issues when dealing with this group of people who are staying in the European Union illegally and, as has already been stated, are often the victims of exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Estimates of how many people from third countries are staying in the European Union illegally are not precise and vary between 4.5 and 8 million. Moreover, these estimates give no indication as to the proportion of men and women in that total, and neither do they grant an insight into the gender-specific problems which illegal female immigrants face. I would draw your attention to the fact that female illegal immigrants are very vulnerable and that they are often at the receiving end of forced labour, human trafficking and violence. This, therefore, requires specific education within the bodies that deal with these issues.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As ever, though, this is about effective monitoring. I am pleased that the arbitrary 10% monitoring level that was suggested initially has now been dismissed and that a risk approach has been incorporated in the compromise text. The reports in the Belgian newspaper De Standaard last summer about house slaves in certain embassies in Brussels, only a stone’s throw from the Berlaymont building, prove that these scenarios are not far-fetched. I would therefore like to say to the European Commission that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Face up to your responsibility to examine critically how countries deal with this legislation and whether they apply it effectively.</p>

      <p sl="mt">This law, Madam President, is probably one of the first that directly tackles the illegal immigration phenomenon using legislative tools, and now it can be said that this law has finally arrived. It was sorely needed and therefore I am extremely pleased that we have managed to reach an excellent compromise here. What exactly did we achieve by way of this law? What we did was to attack one of the main sources that motivate people to turn to illegal immigration. We attacked incentive. What kind of incentive are we referring to? The incentive is that a person living, for example, in Africa might have to risk his life in order to journey to another country, thinking that he might find work there, even if illegally. From now on, we are sending out the clear message that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated and therefore it makes no sense to make the crossing over to Europe, while under the mistaken impression that there are jobs to be had here. As of now, this will be absolutely impossible. As the previous speaker said, it is important that this instrument is not used to regularise irregular situations, but should serve as a clear message that illegal employment can no longer be tolerated. This is being enforced through effective measures and sanctions: financial, administrative and even criminal ones. These also serve to pass on the unequivocal message to employers that we shall no longer tolerate the recruitment of workers without a permit. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we have managed here in the European Parliament to radically change the objective of the directive which we are debating today. Claudio Fava deserves our congratulations on this in particular. Firstly, we have managed to obtain provision for the mandatory payment of remuneration outstanding to illegal immigrants who are deported. Secondly, we have helped to ensure that provision is made for strict and binding criminal sanctions for employers of immigrants under unacceptable living conditions. Thirdly, we have safeguarded the right of trade unions and other bodies to go to court on behalf of immigrants and, fourthly, we have imposed the right to grant residence permits of short or longer duration to illegal immigrants who uncover criminal organisations. In other words, we are at last treating illegal immigrants as human beings, without at the same time legalising illegal immigration, which is why we support this compromise.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, there is still a dangerous mismatch between the continuing police approach to illegal immigration and the reality in numerous Member States. That is why the application of the directive will also require special attention. It could lead thousands of illegal immigrants into poverty, ghettoisation and crime and, although we demonstrably cannot or will not deport them, these illegal immigrants may remain out of work. If, in fact, numerous illegal immigrants are currently occupying jobs in Europe which Europeans do not want, we should now be debating in this House, at long last, common rules on legal immigration into Europe and the legalisation of these people, not new rules to deport them.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, the absolutely necessary fight against the black labour market obviously does not only concern illegal immigrants; it mainly concerns legal immigrants, it concerns millions of European citizens whose employment rights are trampled underfoot by their employers on a daily basis, it concerns the fact that employment laws are being trampled underfoot, without any material control or material sanctions. Today’s directive should therefore have as its legal basis, in my opinion, the general fight against undeclared work in Europe, not immigration in particular. This targeting of immigrants every time something goes wrong in Europe is very dangerous for social cohesion in our countries. Obviously, illegal immigration also needs to be combated, but we cannot demonise people who are fleeing miserable conditions in their own country in the hope of a better life.</p>

      <p sl="nl">For years, the European Union has had to contend with the presence of millions of illegal immigrants on its territory, and the pressure to find a solution is mounting. This pressure is considerable, and rightly so, frankly. Indeed, if we wish to adopt manageable and reliable migration policy, in which refugees are entitled to protection and in which we create transparent opportunities for legal migration, then an approach that takes due account of all discouraging and encouraging factors that lead to illegal immigration is a necessary measure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last summer, the Council and Parliament reached agreement on what was known as the Return Directive, which mainly focuses on the illegal immigrants themselves, whereas today, we are looking at the employers who do not hesitate to employ illegal immigrants. This is not only a significant inducement for illegal immigrants, but also unmistakeably creates cases of abuse and gross exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The importance of harmonised European policy is, in my view, beyond dispute. After all, when internal borders are non-existent, Member State A may worry itself silly, but if Member State B barely addresses the employment of illegal immigrants, if at all, then Member State A will remain nothing but a voice in the wilderness.</p>
      <p sl="nl">After a rather slow start, there is now, following intense negotiations with the Council, a compromise before us that is acceptable to me, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive and pragmatic way of working. It was like a breath of fresh air which, in fact, cannot be said of a few of his fellow MEPs who now insist, at any price, on this accompanying written declaration, a show for the Bühne , which does not do much for the image of this Parliament. That too, my group will accept.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Moreover, it should be clear that, once this directive has been adopted, it is up to the Member States to galvanise themselves into action. It should be clear that neither the European Commission nor the European Parliament have magic wands at their disposal when it comes to decisiveness or enforcement. The Council was emphatically opposed to a binding percentage of inspections, and this is exactly where the problem often lies – as has been said by many in this Parliament, as well as the Commissioner. All I can do now is urge you to turn this enforcement into reality so as to ensure that we do not get bogged down with empty words on paper once more as, indeed, nobody benefits from this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The proposal is again a step in the right direction when it comes to achieving comprehensive migration policy. We still have a long way to go though, so what we must do now is persevere. In this connection, I would like to ask the 64 thousand dollar question that has been on everybody’s lips today: why is the Council absent from this debate? This is, quite frankly, unacceptable, in my view.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Union is not coping with illegal immigration. Many facts prove this, and we also see this in Mr Fava’s explanatory statement, where we read, amongst other things, that ‘[i]t is estimated that there are between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants in the EU, a figure that is steadily increasing, notably because of easy access to illegal work.’ The very fact that the numbers from 4.5 million to 8 million are used shows that we are not even able to state precisely the scale of this problem and issue. And yet, economic migration also concerns many EU Member States, especially those which acceded more recently.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, millions of Poles and citizens of other countries are moving within the EU to the old Member States. These citizens are subjected to the same ills and are in the same situation as migrants from third countries. For illegal employment means the exploitation of workers while denying them the benefit of health insurance or pension rights, the exploitation of juveniles and even human trafficking. We can overcome this phenomenon only when there are severe legal sanctions and when we consistently make use of them.</p>

    <intervention id="2-061" speaker_id="4531" name="Jean Lambert" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, we very much appreciate the work of both Mr Fava in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and Ms Bauer in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I think we in this House will have to get used to the enhanced cooperation procedure on measures which actually link employment and migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has already been said, this is supposed to be part of the common immigration policy of the European Union, dealing with the pull factor of possible work, often within the informal economy and amongst vulnerable and non-organised workers. However, it can also apply where there are genuine vacancies, which cannot be filled from the national labour pool, and where Member States are not issuing sufficient work permits, or where there is a creaking bureaucracy that cannot respond quickly enough to applications with a labour-market purpose. There is also a gap that we have yet to fill for people for whom no return to their country of origin is possible – for example, to Zimbabwe – and who are often left legally destitute, as it were, and, therefore, need to find a way to keep themselves alive.</p>
      <p sl="en">The majority of Member States already have, in theory, measures in place to deal with the situation of irregular migration, and you would think that would signal an apparent commitment to action. Yet the Commission proposals on inspection in its original document have been really watered down, and Parliament has had to fight to get even what we have currently in Article 15. It is to be hoped that those inspections will not just pick off small businesses but will actually look at some of the larger enterprises that rely very heavily, at the bottom end, on vulnerable workers. That is why the issue of subcontractor liability was extremely important to many of us in this House. Some of us consider that what we are left with is, again, a watered-down version of the Commission’s original proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">People have mentioned the issue of the residence permit, where Member States may choose to make this available for particularly severe cases where complaints have been brought. That, I suppose, is a step forward – at least from where some Member States were.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues that has concerned many of us is remuneration – when you cannot determine what the length of an employment contract was – and issues regarding payment of national insurance and tax, which we know for many vulnerable workers are often taken out of their pay packets but not necessarily handed on to the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">For many of us, this issue about payment for work done is a question of principle; it is also that companies and economies have benefited and that this is not supposed to be a legislative measure to punish the irregular migrant. It is also – if you are looking at this as part of an overall policy – part of a sustainable return that people will actually go back with what they have earned.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have no guarantee that Member States will ensure that people are paid. We have an assurance that mechanisms will be in place so that claims can be made but not that money will be paid out. There is thus no guarantee that payment will be made. Some may take the view that individuals take a chance and there is a risk, but if we are looking at questions of human dignity, and where this fits in the overall goals of a common immigration policy, this is a serious issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, for my political group, the balance of this proposal is no longer clear either on inspections or remuneration, and other areas have been watered down. We do not feel that Member States are showing much commitment and, therefore, we will not be supporting this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are between four and a half and eight million non-EU citizens in an irregular situation in Europe – these are the Commission’s figures.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is an utterly negligible number: just over 1% of the resident population of the European Union. It is clearly a problem that has been over-exaggerated. These are workers who perform useful services, such as personal services and work in the tourist industry and, in the vast majority of cases, they have been absorbed by the job market. These are workers who are useful to our economy, but they are exploited workers – exploited to reduce labour costs and to enrich unscrupulous employers. These are workers who often do jobs not performed by EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need these people, but they have entered Europe illegally for a simple reason, which is that there is no legal way for them to come in. The same thing happened to the great majority of citizens whose situation is now legal but who entered the European Union illegally.</p>
      <p sl="it">What was needed was another measure: one that regularised the situation of these millions of people. What was needed was a measure to free them from slavery, blackmail and exploitation. Instead we have a directive that carries on where the Return Directive left off. First we decided on the expulsion procedures; today we are deciding on the potential expulsion catchment area and are even specifying who will pay for the expulsions. With this directive, the exploited pay more than the exploiters. Unfortunately, there is no provision for a general regularisation measure, not even for those who report their own status, or who report their exploiters or the crime that is being committed. They go straight from being exploited in illegal work to being expelled.</p>
      <p sl="it">We needed something different. We needed a measure to favour legality, and not the criminalisation of those who are currently here illegally. We needed a measure to curb xenophobia. Yesterday, the Italian Minister for Home Affairs said specifically, ‘We have to be hard on illegal immigrants’; in other words, we have to be hard on the vulnerable. I believe we are fostering this kind of xenophobic attitude with this directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">We in the European Union need immigrants – the Commission says so itself: 50 million by 2060 – because we are in the middle of a demographic crisis, but we are doing nothing to help them enter. Instead, we are harmonising the expulsion system and today we are deciding to expel those who are here illegally even though they may be workers who have been absorbed into the European job market.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think the effects of this directive will be devastating, because it will make immigrants and the job market go even further underground and increase the exploitative crimes of unscrupulous bosses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, illegal immigration is a problem, which is made worse by the free movement of peoples. However, the current wave of unrest that is spreading rapidly through Britain is, of course, being caused by legal migration and by the European Union’s own rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">For 20 years, British trade unions, having being seduced by Jacques Delors, thought the European Union was in their interests. Well, now the penny has dropped and they have realised that a British government is unable to put British interests first.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am afraid it will get quite a lot worse. As we embark upon a round of massive public spending projects, such as the Olympics and council house building, thousands of European workers are set to benefit. British jobs for British workers cannot be guaranteed all the while we are inside the EU. The prospect of British taxpayers funding foreign workers is, frankly, unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">But the Government is holding firm, saying that the European Union is a wonderful thing. Well, it is not surprising is it? Lord Mandelson is still getting GBP 78 000 a year from the European Commission and, of course, gets a dependent pension on this in just a few years’ time – a conflict of interest if ever I saw one.</p>
      <p sl="de">The big concern now is whether the xenophobic far right will benefit. We do not want that either. We in UKIP will put a non-racist agenda to the British people at the European elections, saying that it is time to put British interests first. We are not protectionists, but we want good common sense. We want to control our own borders and decide who lives, works and settles in our country.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, throughout the world the hope of obtaining a well-paid job has a very strong appeal. In particular, in difficult economic times, the black economy starts to grow which, of course, results in many people risking their lives in the search for the land of plenty. It is important for us to make it clear that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the recent report on fundamental human rights presents a few problems in this respect. The report indicates that breaches of EU entry requirements will be rewarded, as immigrants will be given greater protection than the people of Europe, whose identity and social harmony are under threat from mass immigration. Illegal immigration will be trivialised if, in future, every illegal immigrant is seen simply as a person without a valid work permit.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must not forget that migrants without residence permits will ultimately have to be deported. It is important for us to do away with incentives, such as mass legalisation and the prospect of employment. In addition, we must negotiate effective agreements on deportation with the countries of origin. Also, the FRONTEX border security organisation must finally be expanded so that it can be deployed efficiently.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The current directive helps consolidate the common policy on illegal immigration and is a first step towards combating illegal employment by imposing financial penalties on employers. However, I should remind you that all Member States have national legislation governing illegal work and tax and duty evasion. Applying these laws also helps to identify the employment of illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I believe that it is important for us to have adequate regulations, but it is even more important for Member States to ensure that these regulations are strictly applied. I welcome the provisions in the final text on sanctions which are proportional to the number of illegal employees, as well as on imposing smaller fines where the employer is a natural person and the employee provides personal services or domestic help, and the working conditions are not regarded as exploitative.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council have resulted in clarifying the concept of a subcontractor which can be held liable and in establishing the amount of the retrospective payments which need to be made by the employer. I firmly believe that the application of this directive will improve the situation in terms of observing Community preference when assigning jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also feel that the application of this directive should be an additional reason for Member States to remove the labour market restrictions imposed on European citizens, in view of the fact that restricting the chance of employing illegal immigrants will create new opportunities for the EU to recruit its own citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I would like to begin by thanking Claudio and everyone else who made this report possible. In previous debates about future asylum, refugee and migration policy, we mainly focussed on those who stay here illegally, on those who are well-educated and who are permitted to come here, or on people who are simply poor and wish to provide for their family and want to be able to come here.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Now we are placing the responsibility on employers who employ people with no documents. There would not be as many people without documents staying here if we did not always have irresponsible employers who will pay and exploit them. To me, it seems quite right to impose sanctions and to introduce an information requirement for employers, and if an employer has exploited someone, compensation should be paid even after that person has gone home.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, there is one proposal that I would have voted against had there not been a vote in the committee, and that is that the majority is introducing less stringent rules for employment in the home. This, for me, is a question of equality, as it has mostly been women who have been working in the home for low wages. This group has also found it more difficult than those in workplaces with several employees, but I see this as a first step.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I was sorry to hear in the news today that the Swedish Conservative Government has a negative view of the report, which is intended to support responsible undertakings and criminalise irresponsible undertakings that exploit workers with no documents.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I am, of course, also concerned about the opinions we received from the trade unions regarding the report. I hope that we will be able to resolve these issues before a decision is taken. The same rules must apply to all employers, such as shared responsibility in connection with works contracts, otherwise we will be incorporating loopholes and encouraging cheating.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the best way to safeguard a controlled form of immigration that is manageable for our society – manageable in both economic and social terms – is to combat illegal employment as well.</p>
      <p sl="es">This does not mean we should fight against illegal immigrants themselves, since every one of them has his own story to tell, but rather against the phenomenon of illegal immigration as the only way to justify and truly systematise controlled immigration, particularly in today’s world.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of course, this should be done not only through those seeking work but also through those offering it. The fight against illegal immigration cannot only be waged in the underground stations in London or Madrid but must also be carried out in the human resources departments of the many companies that employ illegal workers in order to exploit them and deprive them of their rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">That, therefore, is our reason for wholly welcoming this directive. It is a directive that gives context to employers’ obligations and, certainly, the sanctions that must be imposed on employers who exploit workers without rights for their own benefit.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is a well-balanced directive. The rapporteur should be congratulated on having reached a fair compromise and achieved a good balance on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to highlight those articles that safeguard the rights of workers who have been exploited. They protect workers so that they can report the situation in which they find themselves. They protect them by guaranteeing that they can claim back what they have earned, without, of course, this resulting in a right to remain. However, any work that was done illegally, without national insurance and without payment will, of course, be remunerated regardless of the employment status of the worker who was working illegally.</p>
      <p sl="es">The sanctions are certainly suitable and in proportion. The agreement on subcontracting, to which the rapporteur has already made reference in his speech, is very important. It is of great importance in practice, and that is what we are talking about.</p>
      <p sl="es">Just one final mention: I consider the 24-month transposition period for this directive to be excessive. I realise that this cannot be changed, but 24 months is too long and should be shortened if possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, employing third-country nationals who are staying illegally in the European Union makes fair competition impossible and also denies the employees concerned the right protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am thinking first and foremost about safe working conditions and social protection in the case of an accident at work. The number of illegal immigrants in the EU is estimated at 4.5 - 8 million people, and they are most often found working in the construction, agriculture, tourism, hotel and services sectors. Cases of slave labour occur, under conditions of exploitation and child labour. Illegal employment plays a significant role in reducing standards of employment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is why the right of trade unions to represent the interests of these workers is so important. It is the employer who decides to take on a person who is staying illegally, and so it is the employer who should be subject to a penalty for breaking the law. Coordinated action by all the countries of the EU is needed to tackle every aspect of illegal employment.</p>

      <p sl="en">While Member States need to take steps to regulate immigration, I regret very much that the legal base for this proposal is the fight against illegal immigration. The real fight is against rogue exploitative employers, and what we need at this time is an agenda that is pro-worker, not anti-immigrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">The political and economic imperative must be to stop the exploitation of irregular migrants, to punish rogue employers, not to scapegoat or criminalise workers, migrant or otherwise.

      <p sl="nl">It is to be welcomed that a directive will be introduced that will penalise employers of illegal immigrants. It is stated, with good reason, that the possibility of finding a job in the European Union is an attractive factor for illegal immigration. We should, however, be consistent and also tackle the other factors that attract immigrants. The most important of these factors is the impunity with which aliens can come to Europe illegally. There are, in fact, Member States that reward illegal aliens, the mass regularisations in Spain, Italy and Belgium, among others, being a case in point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is also the hypocrisy of the so-called individual regularisations on humanitarian grounds. Last year alone, there were no fewer than 12 000 in as small a country as Belgium. Illegal immigrants should be deported, not regularised, for indeed, every regularised illegal immigrant attracts a multitude of new immigrants. Every Member State that regularises them does so on behalf of the other Member States. It is therefore not enough to tackle the employers. We must address illegal immigration in its entire context.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, during this plenary sitting, we have adopted several measures aimed at creating a coherent and integrated immigration policy. This common policy must, firstly, involve legal channels for immigration as well as the integration of these immigrants into the host societies. To this end, two months ago we adopted the Directive on the Blue Card and the Directive on a single application procedure for a single permit to reside and work in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At the same time, we must fight illegal immigration effectively, as well as all forms of criminality that are associated with it. This initiative seeks to fight the pull-factors for illegal immigration into the European area and bring an end to the exploitation of illegal workers. It is important for those who attempt to enter the European area at any price – sometimes paying with their own lives – to understand that there is only one possible route: legal immigration, with all its inherent rights and opportunities. It is estimated that there are between 5 and 8 million illegally staying immigrants in the European Union; a significant number are doing low-skilled, fairly low-paid jobs and, in some cases, being severely exploited. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fava, and, in particular, my colleague Mrs Bauer, on their work and on the compromise reached.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore agree with combating illegal work across the European Union. The intention of this directive is to ensure that all Member States are able to introduce similar sanctions for employing illegal immigrants and enforce them effectively. It will be possible to impose three types of sanction: financial, administrative and criminal, depending on the gravity of the infringement. There will also be a requirement for employers to take preventative measures and to check the immigration status of these individuals in order to avoid employing workers who are staying in the Union illegally.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Claudio Fava, on this report and on the fact that agreement was reached in the trialogue meeting. Of course, it is always possible to ask for more and to achieve more. However, the fact that it has at last been recognised within the European Union that illegal immigrants who are caught must also be granted rights and must be protected against exploitation represents an important step forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, this must form part of an overall policy on migration and immigration. No one disputes this. However, there is one thing that I do not understand. While the Greens – Jean Lambert is no longer here – or those on the left from the so-called communist side, such as Giusto Catania, maintain that this does not work, that it has once again come to nothing, that nothing can help, I would like to say that it does not help to promise the people living in these difficult situations a four-course meal and then to fail to give them their daily bread. This is cowardly and unhelpful. I have to ask myself what the Greens really want if they always vote against measures which would improve people’s situations. We have already seen this in the case of many reports and actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, there is nothing to prevent national states from establishing proper controls, imposing fines and making subsidies and national and EU funding unavailable to companies who employ illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to see the same tough approach which the Member States sometimes use in the case of illegal immigrants being applied to tax evaders and those who work on the black market. Of course, we must speak to our colleagues in the national parliaments to encourage them to demand that illegal immigrants be granted the rights which have been decided on here. There is, of course, one thing that we can be sure of. If someone is employed illegally because he can no longer survive in his own country, he does not have the option of going to the police and saying that he is being exploited. In the same way, a woman who has been raped cannot report the crime. Both of these people know that if they do go to the authorities, they will be deported.</p>

      <p sl="de">The report makes it clear that both parties involved in illegal employment must be held equally liable, which will create a legal balance. Illegal employment must be penalised and prohibited in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Employers must be made responsible for upholding this ban, but it is also the job of the relevant authorities to monitor the observance of the ban and to impose penalties. The most important issue is to protect the people in these employment relationships from exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Establishing legal penalties certainly represents a step forward. However, the authorities must put in place more controls and prosecute those suspected of committing offences. The report is a compromise between the Council and the European Parliament and specifies minimum standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, the prospect of Member States strengthening or weakening the requirements is not inspiring. We have taken the first step forward.

It concerns illegal employment, which often leads to wage compression and a reduction in state revenue, with all the concomitant difficulties in providing benefits, and a reduction in the operation of the welfare state. It deprives employees of access to social and other insurance, to pensions and even to bodies responsible for protecting the conditions that prevail at their place of work.</p>

They have managed to achieve an exceptional compromise with the Council, with the help, of course, of Vice-President Mr Barrot, whom I also congratulate. At long last, the directive imposing sanctions on employers of illegal immigrants has been advanced to the stage of final approval. I believe that, formulated as it is now, the directive will effectively serve the objective of combating the employment of illegal immigrants. This is the first time that the European Union has turned its attention in the right direction towards people who exploit illegal immigrants, towards employers who break the law. At long last, the employment of illegal immigrants has been criminalised. The criminal and other sanctions provided for in the directive will, I am sure, be a frightening deterrent which will help to limit and prevent the unacceptable exploitation of illegal immigrants. Multiple, balanced and realistic sanctions are provided for in the directive. I trust that they will prove to be effective. Despite the fact that illegal immigrants are treated as victims and protected by the directive, they too are being given a dissuasive message that it will no longer be easy for them to find employment and, consequently, that there will be no attraction in obtaining work even on unfavourable terms. However, special care must be taken for all those illegal immigrants who are already in the European Union. In my country, Cyprus, where illegal immigration is a huge problem, illegal employment was criminalised some time ago. Of course, it has not wiped out illegal employment, but it has limited it. However, with the multiple sanctions provided for in the directive and the system of inspections of employers being introduced, the problem of employment of illegal immigrants and of illegal immigration in general will certainly be mitigated.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It was no easy task and the path was strewn with pitfalls. However, I think the results are very positive and I will mention three points in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The sanction applies here to the offending employer, whilst the migrant is considered to be the victim. Apart from financial penalties, penal sanctions are recommended for repeat offenders, for trafficking in human beings or exploitation of minors. I believe that penal sanctions are essential and I also believe that it is up to us to ensure that regular checks are carried out so that this directive is effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another positive point to mention is the automatic payment of outstanding wages to the workers. Finally, associations and unions are advocating the defence of the interests of workers living in a country illegally so that they can report a dishonest employer without fear of subsequent prosecution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, as with many other texts, we could have gone further but can we take the risk of threatening the compromise position when this text will already allow major advances in protecting workers and their dignity?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to support a balanced view of the migration issue and recognise that immigration for work is more than necessary and will become increasingly so in the future given the demographic forecasts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, it is therefore essential to state that the model we want is one in which immigrant workers are viewed as fully-fledged workers enjoying the same rights as workers from Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must therefore mobilise to defend these rights and this is why I think we should give our support to this report, because it is a decisive step in the introduction of minimum standards and in the fight against illegal working and the exploitation of migrant workers.</p>

We also know that thousands of people every week are trying to find a better life in Europe. Many of them die on their way to our continent. We know that many people without documents are exploited and live in miserable conditions. This is not worthy of the European Union. The universal values that the EU wants to spread throughout the world include the right of every person to a dignified life. There is a shameful paradox here.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The fact that the EU is to have a common asylum and migration policy is reasonable, but it must not mean that those countries that want to take a harder line and hunt down people in various ways should be the ones making the decisions.

At the same time, it is important that the devious employers who exploit people in a vulnerable position know that punishment and sanctions can be meted out anywhere in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Fava report introduces progress and humanisation into the immigration laws. It provides us with the moral reassurance which we have owed ourselves since the Return Directive. The general ban on employing illegal immigrants not only avoids the endemic illegality of immigration, but above all avoids the potential for exploitation and taking advantage of human misery that generally goes hand in hand with this type of work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first essential point about the Fava report is that it challenges the school of thought on illegal immigration that settles for an easy but unacceptable condemnation of immigrants, instead setting out a systemic response that makes the state and the employer equally responsible. Until now, the main failure of immigration policies has been the lack of a fair response to the terrible situation of illegal immigrants, with the weight of the legal system falling on them and their status as culprits rather than as victims.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second essential point about the report is that it brings into the European public arena an ethic of shared responsibility between the state and companies. The obligation of employers to carry out advance supervision by checking workers’ residence status is valuable in that it grants a competency to the private sector; something that the European Union has not often tried. We applaud this competency because the defence of legality and public ethics falls not just to the state, but to everyone. The report is therefore blazing a trail for a new political method which other reports ought to follow.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The third point – and, coincidentally, the most fundamental one – is the crucial separation of the obligation to pay remuneration from the problem of the legality of residency. It constitutes a simple declaration of the universal moral precept that states that humanity comes before the rules of the legal system and takes precedence over them.</p>

The aim of this directive is clear: to fight against mafia groups, to penalise unscrupulous employers and to protect exploited immigrants who have no form of social protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">We want to see the disappearance of starvation wages, which are unfair on immigrants and, what is more, distort average wages, particularly in sectors such as construction, agriculture, domestic services and the hotel industry.</p>
      <p sl="es">These measures require a great deal of courage and political will, for there are many vested interests and a lot of money circulating in the informal economy. Particularly in difficult times, it is more important than ever that we manage migration flows intelligently and generously, but responsibly.</p>
      <p sl="es">It would be easy to succumb to the temptation of not trying to keep the informal economy in check. We cannot look the other way and leave some 8 million illegal immigrants defenceless against working conditions bordering on slavery.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, if we want this directive to be effective, there need to be rigorous inspections and economic sanctions, including criminal sanctions in the most serious cases, which will act as a deterrent to employers.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will thus succeed in shrinking the informal economy market and putting an end to the incentive to migrate that arises from the possibility of working illegally. It must be made clear that working legally is the only way to work in Europe. For this reason, we want to move forward with a global approach and, Commissioner, Mr Barrot, we call on the Commission to introduce the new ‘blue cards’ for all other employment categories as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The result of easy access to illegal work is that there are several million illegal immigrants in the European Union. Illegal employment, very often in conditions of exploitation, leads to reductions in pay levels in the sector concerned and also imperils competition between businesses. Furthermore, unregistered workers do not benefit from health insurance or pension rights. It is therefore essential to establish mechanisms which will enable exploited workers to file complaints against their employers personally or through the agency of a third party.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I will also draw your attention to the fact that the directive should also include in its scope workers who are legally resident in the EU, in particular, citizens of the Member States which acceded to the EU in 2004 and 2007, and who are still subject to transitional provisions which restrict their access to legal work.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, today’s proposal forms part of an overall attempt to find a solution to immigration policy in the European Union which, of course, we must all accept smacks of dishonesty. Dishonesty because we are trying to correct certain aspects of this policy with the blue card, with the decision to remove illegal workers, with the decision today to punish employers of illegal immigrants, but these are only some aspects of the problem that we are trying to correct.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, we cannot understand how an illegal worker takes on work and the person who takes him on in order to cover his residency and survival costs is ultimately punished. It is a logical contradiction which we need to cover with the terms imposed by decent work. The legislation of all 27 Member States prohibits illegal and undeclared work, especially with the dual absurdity we have here of illegal entry to the Member State and illegal exploitation. The problem is therefore a complicated one and the compromise achieved does, of course, have a lot of gaps. One such gap is with employees who are used mainly by people, shall we say, for charitable reasons and, of course, they provide work but, at the same time, they find a way to live. What will become of them? How will they live the rest of their life within the framework of their forced illegality, given that neighbouring countries have not accepted the return of immigrants?</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we well know in this House, compromises must be analysed by separating the pros and the cons and reaching an overall judgment that takes on board the constraints and the legislative and political context.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the employment sphere, a prominent element in the directive that will be put to the vote tomorrow, our judgment is positive on many aspects. Some positive points include the insertion of a definition of remuneration that makes comparison possible with legal employment relations; the reduction of the procedural burdens of sanctions for domestic and care work; and the linking and strengthening of Community provisions protecting the victims of trafficking and exploitation, particularly minors. The undertaking not to regard the provision on subcontracting as a precedent is also important.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some doubt remains on liability in the chain of employers and on the difficulties workers face in receiving payments due to them before they leave the country. The question is not entirely hazy but, since this directive is tightly bound to the Return Directive, its hands are tied with regard to the situation of illegal workers and employers who have not been able to find legal employment routes.</p>
      <p sl="it">My confidence that we will decide to adopt this document at first reading is not diminished if I point out a couple of risks: the risk that Parliament’s work will continue to suffer pressure from the national governments, and the risk that we will be reinforcing the ‘evil stepmother’ face of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, this draft directive is of key importance in the fight against illegal immigration and has been essential to the introduction of a common policy on immigration. We are all aware that undeclared work is the main attraction for the thousands of men and women who cross our borders every day in search of a decent job and a way to feed their families.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In reality, they often find employers who use and abuse their fragile situation and their ignorance of their rights to exploit them and use them as cheap labour. This is what we know as modern slavery.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must not hide the fact that this phenomenon also involves individuals, be they European citizens or people from third countries, who are working and residing normally, but who fall outside the scope of this directive, as it forms part of the framework of the fight against illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not a case here of pointing the finger at men and women who are often of good faith yet are victims of dishonest networks or employers. The aim of this text must be precisely to protect these vulnerable people and ensure that their most basic, most fundamental rights are respected; this is precisely the declared objective and ambition of the compromise achieved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should not tar all employers with the same brush and, of course, we should not treat someone who employs a person in good faith, believing them to be working and residing legally, in the same way as those who seek to exploit the situation of these people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to be firm, to send out a clear message. We need courageous provisions that are conscientiously applied. The adoption of this text will indeed send out two clear signals. The first is to employers, to tell them they will be unable to carry on abusing this vulnerable workforce and they will thus be truly dissuaded from recruiting an illegal immigrant. The second signal is to those thousands of would-be illegal immigrants who will be discouraged by the rigorous employment conditions in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and to the rapporteur and, like many, I hope this text will soon be put in place to fight against illegal immigration and, therefore, the promotion of immigration …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur. I am aware that it was no easy task to reach a compromise solution taking account of the interests of the national labour market whilst simultaneously protecting immigrants against exploitation. Mr Fava is certainly to be commended.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I travelled to Italy, to Foggia, as soon as the so-called work camps were discovered. In the latter, both Union citizens and illegal immigrants were living and operating in appalling circumstances. I have an abiding memory of the conditions in which they were living and working. Indeed, they often died as a result of hunger and cruel inhumane treatment. I warmly welcome this directive because it will at last put labour relations on a civilised footing. It represents a victory over grasping employers, their pursuit of profit, a cheap and often even free labour force, and their exploitation of illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this directive to come into force, it must be implemented in all Member States. Paradoxically, under the internal law of the latter, illegal employment is considered a punishable action, and an offence. Nonetheless, the law is not working. We must therefore make every effort to implement this directive. All the necessary legal mechanisms need to be in place so that no more unfortunate cases of this kind can arise.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should now like to address the British Members of this House, and ask them to tell their employers that illegal employment of immigrants is a crime. Do not complain that the Union …</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the most important result of this report is that not only illegally employed third-country nationals, but also their employers, will be penalised. We must be aware – and this really is a crime – that these people are being exploited even in a progressive confederation of states such as Europe. Someone is making a good profit out of them. They have no right to healthcare or pensions and they live in constant fear of being caught and sent back to their home country.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, I believe that another very important point is the opportunity in future of imposing penalties on employers who exploit illegal immigrants. Measures such as fines, responsibility for the cost of deportation, withdrawal of public funding or support or even temporary or permanent closure of the business are, in my opinion, urgently needed to bring about a change in the situation. Regular and effective inspections by the individual Member States are also, of course, essential in this respect, along with the possibility of requiring tax and social security contributions to be paid retrospectively.</p>
      <p sl="de">A Europe in which some people are exploited by others is not a truly social Europe. It is my belief that this directive represents a step in the right direction. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work. However, this must not, under any circumstances, be the last step that we take.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I feel that this legislative initiative is welcome at a time when workers from third countries account for a non-negligible percentage of the European Union’s labour force, making illegal immigration a concern. With this in mind, I would like to stress the need to establish a legislative framework which will allow us to define more clearly the sanctions to be imposed on employers of third-country immigrants staying illegally in the European Union, considering that illegal work is an alarming problem at European level and exploitation of the immigrant labour force is a reality.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We also need to be aware that a number of employers are boosting their profits by employing immigrants without papers, thereby avoiding payment of social insurance contribution or taxes to the state. We must also ensure that this kind of behaviour is appropriately punished.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why each individual state must adopt measures to combat illegal employment, offer greater protection to immigrants and organise regular inspections, especially in business sectors where illegal immigrants are assumed to be employed. We also want access to be given to the European labour market in a controlled manner and for immigrants’ rights to be respected. For this reason, we are asking Member States to adopt all the measures necessary to ensure more effective cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information between the national authorities involved.</p>

      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to draw your attention to the complexity of the current situation. We need to draw up legislation which is equal to this complexity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Throughout the European Union, those who place orders are resorting to a cascade of subcontracting, using subcontractors from the Member States without knowing whether or not the employees are working legally. An amendment was proposed that would check the legality of their employees’ situation. Why has it not been included?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Also, it is stipulated that the main contractor is responsible for the payment of wages, but only if they know that the subcontractors are employing illegal immigrants. Well, you are not going to find anyone who places an order who will spontaneously admit their guilt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the best directive in the world can only be effective if it is accompanied by real checking mechanisms. We could improve these checks if we had more employment inspectors in each European country with wider roles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is essential that we design a more rigorous legal arsenal as soon as possible so that those placing orders are declared wholly responsible in case of fault on the part of subcontractors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should not close our eyes to known practices in certain economic sectors that are complicit in the activities of organised illegal immigration networks.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, in the context of this report, I would like to draw your attention to an urgent problem that has emerged as regards the present crisis. In some countries – including my own – we are witnessing the mass dismissal of agency workers, the majority of whom came to our country from eastern European and Asian countries. They have become illegal workers. After their dismissal, they have been left with no means of support, and so become pawns in the hands of so-called ‘entrepreneurs’ who subject them to even worse exploitation than the agencies did. At the same time, I would like to reiterate the very inadequate human resources that labour inspectorates have at their disposal in many of our Member States. Nothing will change unless we set up a thoroughly trained and equipped network of inspectors who understand labour legislation and who are familiar with European directives.</p>
      <p sl="cs">While the European institutions have now agreed on certain standards for business, there is usually an outcry among the Member States whenever even the slightest attempt is made to do something similar in the field of social legislation. Referring to tradition, subsidiarity and the like in a situation when workers in the European Union are subjected to unbridled exploitation is ridiculous and hypocritical. For this reason, I welcome any attempts to prosecute and sanction those who employ illegal immigrants and I thank Mr Fava.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Illegal employment is concentrated in certain sectors where the work is assumed to be of an unskilled nature, such as construction, agriculture, cleaning and the hotel and catering industry. These sectors use illegal labour to an alarming degree. Especially in times of crisis, employers are tempted to try to get round the law and resort to illegal workers in order to maintain profits or simply survive on the market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The document we have before us today marks a step towards reducing the incidence of illegal employment, which has so many adverse repercussions from a fiscal and social perspective. It is a good idea for us to punish the illegal employment of third-country nationals, but we must not forget that the same scourge is afflicting our fellow citizens from the European Union’s less developed Member States. Even Romanians are facing numerous abuses by employers within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that we are dealing with this subject at a particularly sensitive time.</p>
      <p sl="it">The international economic crisis has led, or is leading, the countries that are in the worst crisis to use illegal labour, which almost always involves illegal immigrants, especially in certain sectors, among which construction, agriculture and others have been mentioned. This encourages illegal immigration, resulting in the tragedies that we have been experiencing. It is not surprising, then, that illegal immigration is increasing enormously, and this afternoon and tomorrow, we will be dealing in this House with the problems of Lampedusa and other border countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">This measure therefore comes at just the right moment. I believe, therefore, that the sanctions laid down for employers will certainly act as a further deterrent, because there are already sanctions for illegal work, especially involving illegal immigrants. These sanctions will further deter employers from hiring workers.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have heard that there are 8 million illegal residents doing illegal work; we must assume that as soon as these measures enter into force, we will have 8 million illegal immigrants on the streets, and we will have to deal with them. I think this is a problem that we must start to recognise, because otherwise those who survive illegally, but survive none the less, will be officially reported as illegal by their employers, who will no longer be able to house them, and we will have an enormous problem of 8 million people in Europe that we will have to expel and help. I believe this is a subject that must be addressed in advance – I am finishing, as I see I am out of time. We must look carefully at the problem of the temporary hiring of workers, particularly in agriculture, and we must cut out red tape to facilitate their inclusion and acceptance.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, illegal employment not only affects five to ten million people but, in particular, those who employ them. Unlike the author of this report, I believe that the problem affects not just illegal migrants from third countries, but also millions of citizens of the European Union who do occasional work for wages which are not taxed and from which the employers do not deduct insurance contributions. The growth of illegal work seriously undermines economic competition. One effective cure that the Member States have at their disposal would be to reduce the tax burden on employment. However, I also support this proposal of the Commission to harmonise sanctions for employers, as I believe that consistent sanctions aimed mainly at employers who are repeat offenders will restrict the availability of illegal work and, hence, also the number of illegal migrants. It will also reduce the scope for social exclusion and, to some extent, also the exploitation of the citizens of third countries. However, I see problems in placing the onus of checking the residential entitlement of workers on employers.</p>

I am very concerned about this provision, because an employer has no way of checking if the subcontractor is employing such persons or not. Should the employer even harbour any suspicions that such is the case, what action should the employer then take? Should he or she report the matter to the police, or terminate the contract? If the contract is terminated, the employer risks being taken to court, and it would then be necessary to justify the reasons for terminating the contract. The employer would not be in a position to provide the relevant evidence. I would therefore like to reiterate my serious concern about this provision. The provision may well turn out to be useless. Alternatively, it may be that it will be used to sanction employers unfairly and unjustifiably.</p>

It is very important to encourage citizens of third countries to enter the territory of the Union in order to take up employment. We are, however, only interested in legal residence and legal employment. Illegal foreign workers mean budgetary losses and distort healthy competition between enterprises. The employers benefit most from the efforts of illegal workers. They can easily procure a cheap labour force. Foreigners from third countries are most often employed in the heaviest and lowest paid jobs. As they are in a difficult situation, they are prepared to do everything the employers ask of them. The latter often exploit their despair. Not only are these people poorly paid, but they are also working without any social protection or health insurance and are under constant threat of expulsion from the country where they are staying. The Union should make it easier for immigrants to take up employment, and we should act accordingly. I have in mind, for example, work in Poland for citizens of Ukraine.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I think this very interesting debate, for which I thank all the speakers, has shown that there is very broad agreement in Parliament on the need to target employers who take on and, very often, exploit illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would point out to Parliament that the impact assessment the Commission carried out showed that the current sanctions have failed to guarantee compliance with the rules. The directive has improved this situation by obliging Member States to introduce equivalent penalties and ensure their effective application. At the start of this sitting, I also stressed that the Commission will monitor the inspections that Member States have to carry out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to thank Mr Fava and Parliament once again for having enabled this compromise. It seems to me to be a good first step.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also point out that this directive is part of the framework of the European Union’s common immigration policy. We must, of course, fight against illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. This is the subject we are dealing with today, but we must also underline the benefits of legal immigration. Apart from the two proposals presented in October 2007, on the blue card for highly qualified migrant workers and on the single permit, relating to migrant rights, in spring 2009, the Commission will present three other draft directives on legal immigration aimed at establishing common rules for seasonal workers, who are generally less qualified, for individuals transferred within their companies and for paid trainees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add that the Commission, in accordance with its commitment to the European Parliament and within the framework of the preparation and implementation of the Stockholm programme, will consider if there is a need for legislation for other categories of migrant workers.</p>

Parliament has, I think, said quite clearly – and not just today – that measures on legal immigration are needed and immigration needs to be dealt with in an overall context, which does not just seek to produce punitive measures against illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are overdue in that respect, and of course we are not happy that the Treaties do not authorise this Parliament to enter into a codecision procedure with the Council on legal immigration. The legal basis that now constrains us to talking only about legislation to combat immigration is something that I too find frustrating, but it is the legal basis that we have to abide by.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having said that, I believe that our report today has introduced articles that genuinely protect the rights of foreign workers, even if they are illegal immigrants. I am thinking of the temporary residence permit for minors who have been exploited. I am thinking about pay: it is, at last, expressly stated that remuneration cannot be lower than that which the law recognises for all other European citizens. I am thinking of the role of the trade unions which, for the first time, can defend and represent foreign workers, even illegal ones, in administrative and civil cases.</p>
      <p sl="it">These, I believe, are all reasons why we can talk of recovered rights, a step forward and not back, and a directive that tackles a difficult and sensitive subject, but with a sense of balance to which this Parliament is particularly alert.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Its first is that it aims to be informative: it records the alarming facts of the growth of illegal immigration in Europe, immigration estimated, according to the Commission’s own figures, at between 4.5 and 8 million people. It also identifies those sectors of the economy in which illegal working is most concentrated, namely, construction, agriculture, cleaning, hotels and catering.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Its second merit is that it intensifies the fight against undeclared work, particularly with the option of financial and penal sanctions for employers of illegal workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, the report has many limitations. It says nothing on what measures should be taken to stem these intermittent flows of illegal immigration. It does not even consider the reintroduction of checks at internal borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a time of both social and economic crisis and a big rise in unemployment, the first requirement for the countries of the Union is to protect their jobs. To do so, it is essential to introduce national and European social protection policies. Jobs in France must be reserved for the French, while jobs in Europe are reserved for Europeans. Application of the principles of national and European preference and protection is an essential condition for economic and social recovery in the countries of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The report compiled by Claudio Fava is part of the package of measures aimed at combating illegal immigration by discouraging companies from employing these people. Unfortunately, the rapporteur placed too much emphasis on measures aimed at punishing employers and supported the extension of illegal immigrants’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As it is extremely important to maintain a balance with regard to the sanctions which can be imposed on employers, I have tried, with the amendments I have proposed, to highlight those provisions in the report where sanctions against employers are too harsh and which could have left scope for an interpretation which would lead to abuses against them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, special attention must be focused on the humanitarian situation of these immigrants. For this reason, it is of paramount importance to encourage Member States to impose criminal sanctions in serious cases, such as when the employer knows that the employee is a victim of human trafficking. In addition, the verification and notification obligations incumbent upon employers as specified by the report play a proper role in making the latter accountable with regard to this acute problem which we are facing in the EU with ever-increasing frequency.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Member States should cooperate more closely to combat illegal immigration by strengthening action against illegal employment at the level of Member States of the European Union. One of the main factors encouraging illegal immigrants to travel to the EU is the possibility of taking a job without the need to regularise their legal status. Action against illegal immigration and illegal residence should serve as a deterrent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nonetheless, the directive on combating illegal immigration should apply without detriment to national legislation banning illegal employment of third country citizens who are legally resident on the territory of Member States, but who are working in violation of their status as authorised residents.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Reducing the financial penalties for employers of third country nationals should also be considered in cases where the employer is a natural person.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all those involved in drafting the directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The statistics on the number of illegal workers in the Union are alarming. Close cooperation is undoubtedly needed in order to combat illegal immigration. Dealing with illegal employment is a priority of the EU’s strategy in the area of immigration.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The draft directive leaves something to be desired. It could be wider in scope and cover citizens legally resident on the territory of the EU, but employed in very unfavourable conditions. It would also be beneficial to broaden the definition of employer to include temporary work agencies and also employment agents. Despite its shortcomings, the project under debate merits commendation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is true that employers bear responsibility for illegal employment. The directive imposes additional administrative obligations on employers and provides for a range of different sanctions for failing to meet these obligations. This does not, however, mean that the directive is only about penalising employers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to make it very clear that our primary aim is to do away with situations where individuals are exploited at work. It must be made impossible for people to be employed in undignified and inhumane conditions, deprived of their rights and of basic social benefits. I believe that the directive in question is essential in order to obtain minimum harmonisation of provisions banning illegal employment. I trust, too, that these provisions will be effectively implemented by the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, if we wish to halt the accelerating process of loss of biodiversity, it is essential to protect Europe’s wildernesses forests and water bodies. For our common actions to be effective, it is vital, firstly, to draw up unequivocal definitions of wildernesses and to establish the precise location of the latter on the map of the Community.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also vital to develop a strategy based on expert analyses of risks and of the processes involved in the degradation of wilderness areas.

This aspect is particularly important at a time of recession. The success of pre-commercial procurement will enable public institutions to collaborate in developing new products in order to improve the quality of public services. We believe that this will increase the interest of SMEs in proposing innovative solutions for improving the quality of public transport, healthcare, reducing energy consumption in public buildings and protecting citizens from security threats without having to intrude upon their privacy. This new approach will help Europe’s public sector to tackle fundamental public tasks without state aid while, at the same time, increasing the innovative potential of European firms.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President-in-Office, at this point, I would like to express my opinion on the unbundling of production and transmission systems for gas in connection with the adopted legislation. The proposed certification procedure for third countries seems a reasonable solution. This is the very first time that the EU is giving its attention to energy security in the context of the gas market. In response to the gas crisis which we have experienced, it is also necessary to speed up the construction of alternative pipelines to Europe which are not dependent on Russia. The main infrastructure projects, such as the Nabucco gas pipeline, which is to link the Caspian region with Europe, cannot exist without large-scale vertically integrated undertakings and their investments. However, these are hardly going to come pouring in if the risk of unbundling, and hence a weakened economic position, is hanging over them. The solution that Parliament could use is to establish exemption from unbundling for the new infrastructure until such time as there is a return on investments. I do not know whether we have exhausted all the possibilities open to us in this legislation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the common energy policy is currently one of the greatest challenges facing the European Union. Our response to it must be based on solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are all aware that Russia remains one of our most important and also most difficult trading partners. The fact that Russia is our main source of gas supply cannot, however, be allowed to mean that it can receive special treatment. The rapporteur suggests relaxing the Union’s policy towards the Russian Federation. I believe that we must pursue a fair but strict policy towards a trading partner that uses the raw materials of energy as a weapon with which to exert political pressure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is emphasised that diversification of energy sources is one of the fundamental issues arising in the area of energy security. One way of tackling this would be to free ourselves from dependency on Russian raw materials. The construction of the Nabucco pipeline and the exploitation of other sources of energy are steps in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Yes, we should use and promote sustainable energy sources, but pursuit of what for most has become a dogma with no regard to cost or viability needs to be tempered by reality, including the reality that climate change is not new, but cyclical, as well as the reality that while we inflict these targets on ourselves, manufacturing increasingly switches to where no such restraints inhibit them.

The current gas crisis between Ukraine and Russia, unfortunately, not the first one, has affected 15 Central European and Balkan countries. I have not seen figures showing the extent of economic losses which the countries affected have experienced, but I would like to underline the moral and valuable losses. How are EU citizens supposed to feel when the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which was obviously political, ruins the EU economy, energy security, political stability, and EU states are unable to take any measures? I refer to Slovakia and Bulgaria's intentions to renew operations at safe nuclear power stations which had been closed, something which many of us parliamentarians support.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I distance myself from the amendments just announced to the Záborská report on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity. A mature European society must learn to see full-time care for children and other dependents as a fully valued alternative to professional life. The proposal from the Greens, which attacks this approach by the Czech Presidency and calls it reactionary, is, in my view, erroneous and immature, although the MEPs have unfortunately voted for it. Far from being a reactionary relegation of women to a role of subordination to men, it is a way to rehabilitate the family within society, giving equal rights to men, too. Today it is men, too, who push prams and care for children in hospital. Those men and women who devote part of their lives to caring for a child or for infirm parents are performing socially important work which must not, in future, be considered an inferior occupation. I welcome the fact that the Czech Presidency has placed this approach among its priorities. Our aim must be to create conditions where a man or woman who decides to take this course will not suffer discrimination in the job market and will be able to use a range of options for balancing work and family life according to the principles of flexicurity. We must strengthen parenthood, and hence inter-generational flexicurity, instead of weakening it with obstacles imposed by the labour laws. The prejudices of the last century are deepening the demographic crisis. The Záborská report was a step in the right direction, and I object to the amended version which has been adopted.</p>

This is not only a question of care for the younger generation, the new arrivals in the family. In many cases, we also need to solve the problems of caring for older members of the same family.</p>

My second point is that it is evident that there are different social, cultural and economic conditions which can hardly enable the achievement of the Barcelona targets in general terms and equally all over the EU. Thirdly, the report does not take into account further factors, such as the freedom of each family, as well as the interests of children.

Gary Becker, a Nobel prize winner, refers to the importance of the economic contribution made by people undertaking domestic tasks to the economic progress of society as a whole.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I was glad to support the report just now, but I should add to my previous comments the fact that seven countries have not yet committed themselves to the Council of Europe Convention or to the UN’s Optional Protocol containing modern instruments for fighting child trafficking, prostitution and pornography. I am sorry to say that this also applies to my country, the Czech Republic, which, of course, wants to combat this more effectively, but for a long time has been resolving the issue of incorporating criminal liability of legal entities into its legislation. It is, of course, these legal entities that are organising child trafficking and making fat profits from it. I therefore call on the Czech Presidency to ensure that this domestic problem is resolved and that it serves as an example to the other EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, experience shows time and again that the most fruitful scientific collaborations are obtained when two researchers from two institutions collaborate on a commonly designed and jointly funded project. Therefore, in order to bring more substance to the scientific cooperation with the US, I call upon the Commission to explicitly establish simple, project-oriented financing instruments of joint research grants between researchers in the US and the EU. The explicit inclusion in the agreement of fields such as biomedicine, nanotechnology and space research is welcomed. I would like to see included also other cutting edge fields, such as stem-cell research. The fact that there are justified ethical issues related to some research fields should be a drive to a common reflection on these aspects rather than a barrier to common scientific progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Due, in particular, to the European Research Council grants, the EU is increasingly attractive for American researchers. The EU now has instruments to seek higher and longer term incoming scientist mobility and must act so that the EU achieves a net brain-gain.</p>

      <p sl="en">When we talk about wilderness, in reality we are referring to a natural environment from which significant human activity has been absent, in other words, virgin areas. Wilderness may refer to both land and sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are two different approaches: one refers to the concept of conservation and the other to that of preservation. These are distinct. The former can be described as ‘proper use of nature’, the latter ‘protection of nature from use’. I believe that conservation and preservation may be distinct, but their application depends on the particular area. To take an example, Europe is too small to have forbidden areas for its citizens. Forests cover about one third of the land area of which only 5 % can be described as wilderness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most areas in Europe which are wilderness are protected under Natura 2000. This is a European network which already covers the most valuable and bio-diverse areas of the EU.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report. There are several reasons why Europe should be interested in protected wilderness areas. Firstly, they function as refuges and genetic reserves for many species that cannot survive in conditions that are even only slightly altered. There are also many species that have not yet been discovered and described. Most of these live in the soil or in rotting wood and are highly sensitive to change. These unpolluted areas are ideal for studying natural changes and the evolution of nature. At the same time, these areas are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change caused by humans outside their boundaries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there are many purely ethical reasons for preserving wilderness areas in Europe. We have a moral obligation to ensure that future generations can take enjoyment and benefits from the protected wilderness areas in Europe.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report because, in my view, Europe must protect its wilderness areas and contribute to the upkeep of its national parks. According to the ‘Wilderness in Europe’ report, there are 10 national parks in several regions of Europe. The upkeep and protection of these national parks also mean protection for the species of animals and birds which inhabit these areas.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In view of the fact that some of these species are on the point of extinction, I feel that the European Union must become actively involved in developing programmes which will help to revitalise these species and repopulate certain areas where, unfortunately, some species of animals and plants have disappeared.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the same lines, I believe the following measures are necessary: a closer analysis of land clearing activities in areas which are not designated as national parks and the development of specific projects aimed at reforestation in areas which have been cleared. I personally give my strong support to any such project and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The term wilderness refers to a natural environment that has not been significantly altered by human activity. Even now, 46% of the surface of the Earth is classed as wilderness.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a difference between the notions of conservation and protection. The former involves proper use of nature. The latter implies protecting nature against exploitation. In my view, nature needs to be protected, but through human action. Europe is too small for it to be sensible to ban its citizens from entering certain territories. The territories in question are of particular and exceptional value. This can be exploited in an environmentally friendly manner by developing new products in the area of tourism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, these territories are especially vulnerable to the impact of environmental change caused by human beings. It is our moral duty to ensure that the next generation is able to see and experience genuine wildernesses in Europe. The development of sustainable tourism may prove a way of benefiting from the economic importance of wilderness lands and acquiring resources for their protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An interesting initiative linking programmes aimed at wildernesses and sustainable tourism has arisen in Europe. I refer to the PAN Parks Foundation, whose aim it is to develop sustainable tourism in those lands.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is no need to introduce new legislation regarding wildernesses, but the European Commission should develop appropriate recommendations to ensure that that Member States of the EU receive assistance concerning the best ways of protecting present or potential wildernesses that might be included in the Natura 2000 network.</p>

This can be altered through what is known as pre-commercial procurement. Pre-commercial procurement is a special approach for the public sector to procure research and development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU needs a broader innovation strategy. And what we are terming pre-commercial procurement has to be seen as part of the strategy. This is essential to re-enforce the innovation capabilities of the Union and to improve public services for European citizens.

It is obvious why pre-commercial procurement is crucial to help the public sector in Europe address major public challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the problems existing in the EU is a lack of awareness of how to optimise research and development procurement. The problem is a result of what is known as exclusive development. Companies which have developed a product or service for a public body cannot use their findings for other customers. Pre-commercial procurement will address this anomaly. It will allow a specific approach which involves risk benefit sharing. This will also result in cost-effective development of innovative solutions.</p>

Pre-commercial procurement contracts offer major opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises, in relation both to the public contracts sector and to their global development and experience.

Europe does not appear in a favourable light either in comparison with the United States, whose public sector allocates USD 50 billion a year to public procurement in the area of research and development, an amount 20 times greater than the sum spent in Europe. This is most unfortunate if we really want to strengthen our innovative potential.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worth noting that many products and services currently available would not exist were it not for the commitment of public resources. The GPS satellite navigation system and semiconductor technology are but two examples.</p>

For many of these areas, no commercial solutions are yet available, or if they are, further research and development action is required.

Therefore, I particularly support the rapporteur when she urges the Commission ‘to prepare a European strategic plan which would set out long-term investment intended to satisfy the needs of future electric energy production and concrete guidelines for investment in nuclear energy’. As the financial crisis has hit the construction sector particularly hard, equally so in Lithuania, the rapporteur’s call for ‘greater efforts to solve the problem of final disposal of all types of radioactive waste, and especially very radioactive waste’, becomes particularly relevant with the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power station.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (in particular with Russia) must be a means of safeguarding the interests of all EU Members, and EU Member States must adhere to the principles of solidarity and unity in discussions with energy suppliers in third countries. Only a united Europe is strong and competitive in an age of rapid globalisation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The issue of the European Union’s energy security is a regularly recurring topic, which is becoming increasingly relevant, clearly indicating that there are deep-seated, unresolved problems. The recent gas crisis has demonstrated the absolute need for Member States to join forces at Community level and show solidarity, both in crisis situations and in devising and implementing joint solutions which are mutually beneficial.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Being located at the EU’s eastern border, Romania is aware of both the risks and benefits accorded by this geo-strategic position. For this reason, Romania supports and promotes, on the one hand, the construction of alternative energy transit routes, primarily the Nabucco gas pipeline, while, on the other, it supports the process of clarifying and strengthening partnership relations with Russia, which is a major player in the international arena, not only in this difficult sector involving the supply of energy resources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With this in mind, the recommendations made by the rapporteur regarding the Southern Europe Corridor, especially Nabucco, and the interconnection of the gas and electricity networks running from north to south in South-East Europe, must be considered and implemented as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">The gas crisis which we have just survived has clearly demonstrated once again how important a secure, reliable and cheap energy supply is for the EU. It is disturbing that nuclear power is suddenly being promoted as ‘climate friendly’ as part of the energy debate and that reactors which have come to the end of their useful life and which have had millions in subsidies spent on decommissioning are suddenly being reactivated. This is probably a result of the fact that the EU ignored the gas dispute and left the Eastern Member States in the lurch. This is a lesson for the future. We must reduce our energy consumption, although critics doubt whether the compulsory introduction of energy-saving bulbs will achieve this, and we must push for the use of alternative forms of energy. However, while the focus of the budget is on nuclear power, this will never happen and new energy technologies will be marginalised.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although considerations relating to the security of the EU’s energy supply are important, they must not result in support for Turkey’s entry into the EU for reasons of energy policy.

      <p sl="pt">The context in which a strategy that is intended to be long-term is given consideration has a decisive influence on the result of the analysis and the content of proposals. The debate on the Strategic Energy Review is no exception. In this context there are, however, repeated indicators suggesting that it is more permanent than transitory. These indicators include energy dependency (whether on Russia or on the main oil-producing countries) and its consequences; increasing energy costs, whether because of higher prices brought about by greater global demand or because of the decreased purchasing power of states impoverished by a severe economic crisis; and the environmental consequences on various levels of constantly increasing global energy consumption, which the economic crisis is unlikely to reverse. Together, these factors point to a need for a strategic approach based on lesser dependency and, as a result, greater diversity (either of suppliers or of energy consumed); greater efficiency; a sustained research effort into alternative energy; greater integration; and, at the same time, the development of production capacities at a local level – specifically, those using alternative energy sources. It is an enormous challenge, but it is a strategic issue which we cannot ignore.</p>

In my view, total commitment to bringing about an energy-efficient economy should receive top priority in European energy policy. Restricting the consumption of energy should be given absolute priority in a bid to achieve the objectives concerning climate change, sustainable development, innovation, job creation and competitiveness. In fact, an approach such as this is a very effective and inexpensive way of safeguarding a continuous energy supply. As already stated, it creates a huge number of jobs for both highly qualified workers and unskilled ones.</p>
      <p sl="nl">European energy policy must give due consideration to the changing way in which energy is consumed and produced, with a view to the future. Decentralised energy systems will need to be combined with extensive sources of renewable energy. Alongside energy efficiency, energy-saving measures are of key importance. We should therefore insist on insulation, as well as other measures, in the building industry. In this report, the significance of nuclear energy is overrated. It may cover about a third of total demand for electricity, but that only comes to 6% of the total demand for energy.

There are activities carried out by both men and women which do not qualify as formal gainful employment, but one cannot deny that these activities constitute work. For instance, voluntary, domestic and family work are all different aspects of the concept but do not fall within the traditional definition of gainful employment.</p>

Many people of either gender care for dependents and yet, notwithstanding this, the input of such work is ignored by employment statisticians.

There are some six million women in Poland who are homemakers.

To put it clearly and succinctly, we are talking essentially about educating children and, in our ageing societies, caring for dependent people.

Firstly, the left has shown that it does not respect the work of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, although it ostensibly recognises its importance.

The police forces of the various Member States should exchange information and cooperate so as to prevent as many crimes of this sort as possible. I should also like to underline the need to develop effective methods of helping children who have been the victims of paedophilia.</p>

The fight against the dissemination of child pornography must be prioritised. In this regard, European cooperation has a very important part to play in various roles. We Conservatives therefore voted in favour of the report.</p>

Unlike the rapporteur, we do not believe that we should compromise the strict professional secrecy by which certain professions, such as lawyers, priests and psychologists, are bound.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We also believe that we can hardly hold the owner of an Internet site strictly responsible for all discussions that are held on a website, including in private conversations in closed rooms. In spite of the objective, it is disproportionate to require all owners of Internet sites to monitor all of the private conversations that are conducted there in order to be able to guarantee the lawfulness of the site in accordance with this proposal. Instead, we must focus on other, more effective methods of combating networks that disseminate child pornography that do not have such serious consequences for the integrity of ordinary Internet users.</p>

Previous common positions have not yet been implemented in all Member States, while the threat posed to children’s safety by greater technological progress continues to mount. This report would update and strengthen existing measures for combating these abhorrent behaviours, and define them as criminal offences, punishable by law. The implementation of Ms Angelilli’s report means that the protection of children from these abusive practices will increase in response to technological developments, targeting, in particular, the sinister practice of ‘grooming’.</p>

This protection does not apply only to the Internet. It also applies to media advertising, which should be decent and in keeping with moral values, and should not attack young people’s right to innocence.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Parents play a special role in protecting their children against sexual abuse. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly says, in Article 26.3, that ‘parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children’. The education given by parents includes education on responsible use of the media. However, parents cannot consistently perform their educational role if they do not have adequate time to devote to their family and their children. The state should allow parents this free time.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am certainly aware that the issue of Guantánamo has been a subject of great concern to this Parliament. I am also aware that this Parliament, through the various resolutions adopted since 2002, has consistently expressed its opinion on that particular problem. I therefore believe that you have welcomed, as has the Council, President Obama’s decision to close Guantánamo within a year. The Presidency expressed this sentiment through a statement which was issued shortly after President Obama signed the Executive Orders. Ministers unequivocally welcomed this decision at the last General and External Affairs Council meeting, as you probably know.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Obama has also announced his decision to suspend military commission trials, to reaffirm the Geneva Convention, to end the secret detentions programme and to put a stop to enhanced interrogations. These welcome developments will enable us to strengthen even more transatlantic cooperation in the area of countering terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The decision to close Guantánamo is, of course, primarily the responsibility of the United States. Nevertheless, given our shared interest in countering terrorism, and in upholding human rights and the rule of law, ministers at last week’s Council discussed ways in which the Member States might be able to offer practical assistance to the US and, in particular, whether they might accept former detainees.</p>
      <p sl="en">In his executive order to close Guantánamo, President Obama ordered a review of the status of all detainees. This is now under way. Resettlement of detainees would concern those cleared for release in the light of this review. The question of whether Member States might accept former detainees is a national decision. However, it was agreed last week that a common political response would be desirable and that the possibility of coordinated European action could be explored further.</p>
      <p sl="en">This subject raises a number of political, legal and security issues which need further study and consultation and which – and this is also very important – will require the involvement of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in the Member States. This process has just begun, and the Council will return to this issue once some of these issues have been further clarified. This is a subject of ongoing work and COPS is discussing it today, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully understand the continuing interest in this Parliament, as reflected in the draft resolution which has been tabled at this session, and which I have read. I would like to assure you that the Presidency will pay great attention to this issue and will keep you fully informed of the outcome of further discussions in the Council, as well as any other developments.</p>

    <intervention id="2-266" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacques Barrot" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Vondra and am glad to be able to echo what he has just said, since it is obvious that the Commission has to work closely with the Presidency on this difficult issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also particularly like to add my support to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner who, at the last moment, has been prevented from joining us this evening. I will therefore speak on her behalf and on my own.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has given a very favourable reception to the initiatives taken by President Obama since his inauguration. All of the components are now in place for a relaunch of US/European relations and the Commission will make major efforts to revitalise this partnership.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The most striking example of the change of direction by the United States is their intention to look at the issues of human rights in relation to the treatment of suspected terrorists. We welcome, of course, President Obama’s haste to close the Guantánamo detention camp, to reach out to the Islamic world and confirm the United States’ commitment to the Middle East peace process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also note with satisfaction other equally important features of the orders signed on 22 January, namely the closure of the secret CIA prisons, the total ban on the use of torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, and the suspension of trials by military tribunals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union maintains an active political dialogue with the United States in which, of course, we give priority to the promotion of human rights throughout the world. We are also active partners with the US in the fight against the terrorist threat, but always in accordance with our human rights obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The detention without trial of prisoners at Guantánamo over several years has played into the hands of the terrorist groups who are trying to radicalise and recruit new members. The European Union has already shown its opposition to Guantánamo. Your Parliament, the European Parliament, has incessantly called for its closure, because the fight against terrorism has to be carried out in accordance with international law. In the fight against terrorism, it is important to respect human rights not only as a matter of principle, but also to counter radicalisation around the world. We believe that the rights conferred under international law to all detainees should be respected. Except in the case of armed conflict, individuals should not be detained arbitrarily and should have the right to a fair, legal trial. We have raised these issues in the framework of the political dialogue with the United States. The European Parliament has played an important role in raising awareness of this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add, still echoing Mr Vondra, that the case of each of the Guantánamo detainees should be reviewed by the American authorities. A working group, chaired by the Attorney General and consisting of the Secretaries of State for Defence and Homeland Security and high level officials, has just started work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President Obama has announced that new diplomatic efforts will be made to find a solution to the problem of Guantánamo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the last Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers of 26 January, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner would have reported, there was a brief discussion about Guantánamo. Several Member States have expressed their desire to establish a common framework for a concerted European Union approach, even though in the first instance, Mr Vondra, it is up to the Member States to decide, on a case-by-case basis, on the response to any requests from the United States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have proposed, in close collaboration with the Council Secretariat, to investigate these issues more closely. We are examining the issues around how third countries might receive former detainees. Even if freed detainees ought, in principle, to return to their countries of origin, some of those likely to be released after review could not return to their home country for fear of persecution, torture or ill-treatment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conjunction with the United States, we wish closely to examine what the European Union could do to help to relocate these people in a safe place. However, these particular cases will raise delicate, complicated questions that have to be considered in advance. The principle never changes: we should do whatever is needed to guarantee absolute respect for human rights. In all cases, we want to take a positive and constructive attitude towards the new US administration. At the same time, we must take all measures to ensure that the European Union’s approach complies with our obligations on human rights and our own legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This approach will be neither easy nor quick. We will face complicated questions requiring coordination of the Member States’ action to arrive at a coherent European Union response. We will do all we can to contribute to the debate on what practical measures should be taken at a Community level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At present, the US has not made a formal request. As Mrs Ferrero-Waldner repeatedly says, positive cooperation is required. We have to work together with the Member States to put this in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the next Justice and Home Affairs Council of 26 February, we will call on the Member States to take a concerted approach and we might also use the precedent of the solution used when the Palestinians were brought to Europe in the wake of the events at the Church of the Nativity in 2002.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission wishes, of course, to assist those Member States who decide to receive former Guantánamo detainees on their territory. Obviously, though, it is up to those Member States to define the status of former detainees who are also citizens of third countries and who could potentially be transferred to their territory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Each case will be considered individually, taking into account the situation of each individual, humanitarian considerations and security implications. The decision to receive and allocate a status falls, in the end, within the competence of each Member State. This approach must, however, be part of a joint framework as far as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, that is what I have to say on my own and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner’s behalf. I wonder if I should now make the statement about the transport and illegal detention of prisoners across the European area. I shall continue then and make a statement which, although fairly short, will answer a lot of Parliament’s questions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It concerns the CIA using European countries for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners. The line taken by the Commission from the beginning revolves around three ideas: first, the war against terrorism has to be carried out in full respect of fundamental rights; secondly, the truth, whatever it may be, must be established; thirdly and, for me, most importantly, such acts must be prevented in future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has repeatedly expressed its view that the practices referred to as extraordinary rendition and secret detention are a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has also stated that it is essential for the Member States involved to conduct comprehensive, independent, impartial investigations to establish the truth, whatever it may be. This is a positive obligation resulting from the European Convention on Human Rights. It has to be said that investigations have begun in several Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the allegations of secret detentions in Poland, the Commission has written to the Polish authorities several times. As I have been entrusted with responsibility for ‘justice, freedom and security’ issues, I myself wrote to the Polish authorities on 28 May 2008 to stress the importance of conducting proper investigations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following this letter, in August 2008, the assistant attorney general informed me that a criminal investigation had finally begun and that he will inform me of its results. I believe that this is a major development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have also approached Romania about this issue of secret detentions. In June 2008, the Prime Minister of Romania sent me the report from the Romanian Senate’s investigations committee. After further contacts, the Romanian authorities decided to carry out further investigations to examine the information included in the second report from Mr Marty, who himself has been chosen as rapporteur by the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only such an approach, that puts the accent on the need to conduct proper investigations at a national level, will allow us to move forward. The Union and the Commission have neither the powers nor the resources to replace the Member States in this task of uncovering the truth. Only the investigative instruments and resources of the Member States will be sufficient for the task.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, the Commission, and here I am going to make a commitment to you, hopes that these investigations will be completed and will make it possible, where appropriate, to determine who was responsible and, where appropriate, ensure compensation for the victims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to the requests to the Member States to carry out investigations, one of the practical contributions made by the Commission, following the European Parliament resolution of 2 February 2007, was to clarify the definition of ‘state aircraft’ and, when I was Commissioner for Transport, I presented a communication on civil and business aviation that clarified matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament has also requested an assessment of national anti-terrorist legislation. To get an overview of the current situation, the Commission has sent a questionnaire to the Member States on the effectiveness of the measures to combat terrorism and on their relationship with fundamental rights. The Commission has received replies from the 27 Member States and a document presenting these replies will be published in the next six months. There is now a need to throw real light on all these replies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There you have it, Mr President; I have taken up quite some time, ladies and gentlemen, but it is true that, whilst this is an area in which the Union has limited powers, the Commission has endeavoured to encourage the truth to come to light and promote respect for fundamental rights. I can only say one thing, but in saying it I am making a personal commitment. I will, of course, continue to ensure that the whole truth is established, above all, so that we can be sure that such regrettable actions will not be repeated.</p>

    <intervention id="2-267" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Alexandr Vondra" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was expecting two disconnected issues: Guantánamo, on the one hand, and the secret detentions and renditions on the other. As we are all aware, during his first days in office, President Obama in fact made three decisions. The first one I have already told you about, i.e. Guantánamo, but there were two other important ones as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, he ended the CIA secret detention programme. He ordered that in future, all detainees held by the US must be registered with the ICRC. With this decision, he addressed an issue which has been of concern to both the Council and the European Parliament. This is why the Council has also warmly welcomed this decision. I am sure that it is equally warmly welcomed by this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Obama also ended the use of ‘enhanced’ interrogation techniques by the CIA. The US investigators can no longer rely on the legal opinions concerning torture and other interrogation techniques written since 9/11. This decision is important. The European Union is committed to the absolute prohibition of torture and of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the third decision, President Obama has also ordered a review of transfer or rendition policies to ensure they are in line with US obligations under international law. In future, policies must not – I quote – ‘result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the US to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody and control’.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that these decisions, taken together with the decision to close Guantánamo, which I have already mentioned, will further strengthen cooperation with the US in countering terrorism. I think it can also restore a better climate in transatlantic relations and can respond to feelings which were articulated very strongly in this Parliament, as well as among a substantial part of public opinion in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think here we can all agree on one point from the outset: that the context of today’s discussion changed immeasurably. I am also aware that the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners has been a source of deep concern among many Members of this Parliament. You have been following these issues very closely, not least through the activities of the Temporary Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">The position of this Parliament was clearly expressed in your resolution of February 2007. I want to underline to you that the Council has always reiterated its commitment to combating terrorism effectively, using all legal means available, because terrorism itself is a threat to a system of values based on the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council has also stated repeatedly that the existence of secret detention facilities, where detained persons are kept in a legal vacuum, is not in conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law. That remains our view today and we are committed to it, but the change of context with the current developments in the US means that I would also like to focus primarily on the future. Let us look forwards rather than backwards. The Council very much welcomes the recent decision by the US President on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The transatlantic community has been a community of shared values and must remain one if we are to be able to defend our interests in the global world. There is no doubt that human rights and support for the rule of law in the fight against terrorism belong to this shared heritage.</p>

    <intervention id="2-268" speaker_id="1920" name="Hartmut Nassauer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, should prisoners from Guantánamo be accepted in the European Union? This is the question which we must ask ourselves today. The answer will depend on the considerations which we choose to be guided by.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some people allege that the prisoners have been tortured. This is a reason for accepting them, under the dictates of humanity. It is without doubt true that torture is the most inhumane and degrading practice. If these people have been tortured, then they have a right to our sympathy, regardless of the individual accusations made against them. However, is that the only aspect which we have to consider?</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, many of the people who are or were imprisoned in Guantánamo went to training camps for terrorists in Afghanistan after 11 September. They were not tourists who wanted to experience the beauty of the country, but potential terrorists. We have a duty to protect European citizens against potential terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, torture takes place all over the world and we constantly condemn it. We have not yet gone as far as saying that anyone who has been tortured has a right to be accepted in Europe. We have not yet done this, for good reason. Instead we have weighed this consideration against the need for security in the European Union. We must also do that in this case. We must ensure that potential terrorists do not descend on Europe and, therefore, in evaluating this problem, I would like to see the need for security being given the highest priority above all other considerations.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-269" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Claudio Fava will speak on behalf of our group on questions relating to the CIA flights and that part of the discussion. I will focus on the issues relating to the closure of the Guantánamo camp and I will begin by responding to Hartmut Nassauer.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is true that the security requirements of the people in the European Union represent a standard against which we must measure our actions. However, I would like to begin with the question: What causes more damage to our security? Is it the fear of accepting Guantánamo inmates here because they are considered to pose a security risk after their release? Or, more likely, is it the fact that the existence of this camp, which runs contrary to international law and infringes human rights, is the basic reason behind a wave of overwhelming anger felt by millions of people throughout the world? This is because the so-called Western world, which admittedly was provoked in an unprecedented way by the events of 11 September, was, to a certain extent, unable to influence what happened and therefore had to accept the fact that a president of the United States of America disregarded fundamental human rights because he considered this to be an appropriate response to this provocation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that this has made a more significant contribution to increasing insecurity in the world than if we were to state now, when another president wants to return his country to its former greatness, by making the United States of America a symbol for the preservation of fundamental rights throughout the world, if we Europeans were to say now, we want nothing to do with this, you must work out for yourself what to do about it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We would give out the message that a confederation of states such as the European Union, which believes itself to be, and indeed is, a community ruled by law, wants to evade its responsibilities by using this argument at the moment when an illegal situation is being brought to an end. We cannot expect our citizens to accept that this is a security risk. This is the wrong message. It is disastrous, because our behaviour is worse than those people who, like Barack Obama, go there and say that despite all the risks that they themselves are taking, despite the opposition among the military, despite the opposition in the USA, because the people there are also saying ‘leave them in Guantánamo, do not bring them here, here they represent a bigger risk’, who say that despite all this opposition, there is a symbolic power which results from the fact that a new president is returning to a respect for human and fundamental rights, including the rights of those who themselves have not shown any regard for human and fundamental rights. A failure to help him in this situation would be wrong and would run contrary at least to my group’s understanding of the task of the European Union, which is to ensure that the community ruled by law that we have created internally is exported as an aspect of international politics.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can only do that when we contribute in a credible way within our own boundaries to ensuring that the fundamental rights of every individual have priority. Guantánamo is a place of shame. It is a place of torture. For this reason, it is also a symbol of the fact that the Western confederation of states cannot claim to practise what it preaches, which is that, most importantly of all, human dignity is inviolable. This is the first article in our Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Charter does not state that this inviolability can be reduced. Our sense of superiority over the terrorist philosophy has something to do with the fact that we say that we will even grant those people their fundamental rights who want to withhold those rights from others by means of their actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, I believe we can make a greater contribution to the security of the world by closing Guantánamo, by supporting Barack Obama and by playing an active role if the US Administration asks us to do so and if we can work with the government to put in place a process for accepting these people, than if we were to preach a false concept of security which, Mr Nassauer, could only be implemented if the police and the secret service were to do their job. It is not the case that when people come out of Guantánamo, they can move around here freely and unobserved. The security aspect is important, but fundamental rights must, in this instance, be given a higher priority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, when Senator Obama became President Obama, we all heaved a sigh of relief. The axis of evil, regime change, the war on terror: European citizens yearn to see those euphemisms consigned to history, along with the people who invented them.</p>
      <p sl="de">But breaking with the past and reverting to the rule of law take guts and grit, so I congratulate the new President. He was right to condemn waterboarding as torture, right to call a halt to the flawed military trials at Guantánamo Bay, and right to signal his determination to close the camp completely within a year. I welcome the assurance of the Council Presidency today that the US has now disowned all the squalid practices that have tarnished its Government over recent years, including torture in third countries and extraordinary rendition, in order to put an end to the axis of illegality.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, Europe cannot stand back, shrug its shoulders and say that these things are for America alone to sort out. We lack the open debate and the collective change of will which American democracy allows. Yet, too often, Member States from our Union were complicit in what the Bush Administration did. If the 43rd President taught us anything, it is this: that in the administration of international justice, the ‘go it alone’ mentality ends in a cul-de-sac of failure.</p>
      <p sl="de">So the challenge of Guantánamo, the problem posed by 245 suspects floating outwith the justice system, is not an issue for America alone. It is a conundrum we must solve together. The United States must prosecute suspects, where sound evidence exists and in accordance with the rule of law. America must free those suspects against whom there is insufficient evidence and defend them if they are likely to face torture at home.</p>
      <p sl="de">But what about those who are released, who pose no threat, but who have no wish to remain in a country that wrongly imprisoned them? If asked, should not Europe offer those few citizens the rights and freedoms that no other country will? We cannot forever balance the Council’s assertion that it is for individual Member States to decide with the Council’s stated desire for a coordinated European position. Europe has to speak with one voice and play its part in ending this affront to justice. Many of us have criticised America in the past for its failure to work with others. We were right to do so, but our help may now be sought and we would be wrong to say ‘no’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, standard conservative interpretation of international law requires Guantánamo to be closed immediately and unconditionally. After September 11, though, nothing is standard any longer. That is why even President Obama, who is so eager for change, is facing a serious problem in terms of what to do with the people who are currently held in Guantánamo. These are no ordinary inmates. Every ninth person of those released from Guantánamo has immediately resumed terrorist activities. I would therefore urge caution when offering advice to the United States and to Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Three things are absolutely certain regarding this matter. We are certainly bound to remove our citizens and residents from the camp. We are also required to effectively isolate individuals who represent a serious threat. In addition, we should review the Geneva Convention with a view to finding a suitable response to the problem of stateless terrorist armies. Unfortunately, none of these issues have been dealt with appropriately in the draft resolution.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my group welcomes the remarks made by Minister Vondra about Guantánamo Bay. It appears that, in principle, the European Union is seeking a common response, and the Czech Presidency will help us in this. Where exactly inmates will be moved to is still a question of national agreement, but it is reported that Europe will, in principle, react positively to the request from the US. This will please Parliament, because we asked back in 2006 for the EU Member States to insist proactively on the resettlement of former inmates, including in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My question to the Council is: are you prepared to do this in a proactive manner? Would you ask the US now who the inmates are? Will you ask about their backgrounds and what will happen to them, so that we can make the necessary arrangements? I am, however, pleased with this positive attitude, which will hopefully end the human rights violations to which these people have been exposed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, whilst this is wonderful for Guantánamo Bay, which is a symbol, we should not forget that there are also other prisons we should voice an opinion about. Bagram, near Kabul, springs to mind, for example, where some 600 to 700 people are being held. I am asking the Council and Commission to ensure that those prisons will also be closed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Although I was pleased with the remarks about Guantánamo Bay, I am a little dismayed at the CIA. I appreciate that above all, the Council wants to look ahead, not back. I can understand that very well, because when you look back, you see a huge mess. It would be too simplistic to say that since the US now has a new President, we can apply the same standards again for us all, and forget to look in our own hearts and overlook the aid that we have given to a government of which you now say that it has acted incorrectly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, has demanded the closure of the US prison camp in Guantánamo right from the start. Contrary to all the relevant fundamental legal principles and international agreements, people have been held captive and tortured over a period of years and denied a fair trial. Their fundamental human rights have been disregarded. The very power which tries to uphold human rights, democracy and freedom throughout the world has violated fundamental rights in this case and created its own unlegislated area for its war on terror. This is unacceptable!</p>
      <p sl="de">It was important that the European Parliament constantly repeated its call for the closure of Guantánamo over a long period. However, now that a new government has said that it is changing its policy, we Europeans are now starting to cast doubt on what we ourselves have been calling for. We are hesitating and starting a shameful period of horse-trading. I regard this as a cynical approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">What has happened to our call for the universality and indivisibility of human rights? We cannot really be saying that we want to preach one thing and do another. It cannot be true that, in some way, we want to justify and accept this shameful camp. We cannot only regard upholding human rights as an important principle when we demand it of others and do not do anything to promote it ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on the Member States to state their position clearly, but I also say on behalf of my group that the closure of the prison camp at Guantánamo only represents the first step. The US military base at Guantánamo must also be removed.</p>

It is similar to the situation we had at the beginning of the 1950s when the American people and the American system demonstrated its ability to get rid of McCarthyism. It is now demonstrating the same ability by electing a new President, who, on his first day, declared that Guantánamo should be closed. Thank goodness for that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What was wrong here, of course, was the detention of those suspected of terrorism or other crimes. They should be tried and acquitted or convicted, released or punished. Those who are not convicted should be treated as innocent. If we then still suspect them, it is the job of the security services to follow up on that at a later date. I find it difficult to understand why those whom it has not been possible to convict cannot stay in the United States, but European countries should themselves, of course, be prepared to receive those who have not … Thank you for the opportunity to speak.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Anyone who manipulates the principles of rule of law uses the methods of those which the rule of law claims to fight. The closure of Guantánamo Bay prison, where the rights of defence, as we know them in our western world, were not guaranteed, is a good thing. There is no need to expand on this as this has been stressed by many before me. The fact that Mr Bush, through his tough policy, has managed to protect the American people against a second September 11 does not change matters much.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A democracy should respect the rule of law at all times and throughout the world, but democracy should also consider resolute ways in which it can protect itself against the religious extremists who wish to destroy our open society. This is an emphasis that I cannot find in the draft documents before us.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, we should not be fixated on Guantánamo. Cuba itself, which is where the enclave of the American Guantánamo is, is one big prison where thousands of innocent political prisoners remain bereft of any prospect of a fair or swift trial.

      <p sl="en">Firstly, let me make it clear that I for one am not discussing inmates deemed to be dangerous but unsuitable for trial by the United States, and please remember that such a sizeable group still exists. But even those cleared of charges and deemed to be no risk at all still, in my opinion, pose a risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have legitimate fears because, according to the Pentagon, 61 former inmates cleared of all charges and subsequently released are now reported to be engaged in terrorist activities. One is the deputy head of al-Qa’ida in Yemen, and one has blown himself up.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday, President Obama stated on public television that he cannot be sure whether inmates cleared and released will not pose a security threat. Can we be asked to take that risk in the EU? Well I think we can be asked, but we must have the right to decide whether that risk is acceptable to us or not.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States have shown different degrees of willingness to take former inmates. I stress that the decision to accept inmates must be the sovereign one of the Member State. It cannot be forced upon a Member State by the EU, but neither can it be made in isolation. Given the freedom of movement we enjoy in Europe, especially the border-free Europe of the Schengen zone, Member States’ decisions to allow Guantánamo Bay inmates to settle in their country has security implications not only for that Member State, but also for its neighbours. Therefore I require, and we require, that such decisions are consulted with other EU members.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the closing of Guantánamo allows us to rectify a violation that has shamed international law and, above all, has done no service to the war on terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, however, it is not enough to welcome President Obama’s decision. Now is the time to take responsibility, and responsibility also involves Europe and the Member States. Guantánamo is, in part, the consequence of Europe’s silence and the collaboration of many of our governments in the system of rendition. In recent years, what has happened is that our governments were, on the one hand, saying that Guantánamo must be closed and, on the other, sending their police officers there to interrogate the detainees. We are talking about responsibilities which were denied when this Parliament investigated the matter, but which have been acknowledged and verified in the past two years.</p>
      <p sl="it">February 2008: London apologises for the CIA flights; some aeroplanes have used British bases, said Foreign Secretary Miliband, contradicting what Tony Blair had said three years earlier, maintaining that nothing illegal had taken place on British soil. December 2008: the Spanish Government under Mr Aznar knew that many CIA flights had overflown Spanish air space and used Spanish airports. This emerged from a secret document published by El País that turned out to be true. The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Josep Piqué, who acknowledged the use of Spanish airports, said that he did not know what happened afterwards in Guantánamo. Perhaps he thought that it was an amusement park. In October 2008, we learnt that in Portugal, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Amado, admitted that the former centre-right government of Mr Barroso knowingly made Portuguese airports and air space available for illegal CIA flights. Mr Amado said: ‘I did not talk about it so as not to disrupt the serenity of the European institutions’. We ask: and what about the citizens’ right to know? Or are we to imagine that not even Mr Barroso knew what sort of civil and juridical obscenity Guantánamo was then and still is now?</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the point, Mr President, and I am about to conclude: in recent years we have shown much good will and much hypocrisy, not least in what the Council has left unsaid during these years. Two years ago, Parliament addressed 46 recommendations to the Council. We would have expected that at least some of these recommendations would have been given due examination and due attention, that there would eventually have been replies to at least some of the recommendations. For this reason, we believe that providing some help in closing Guantánamo and assuming our collective responsibility, as Europe and the 27 Member States that it comprises, would be a contribution, however small, to atone for our collective silence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the main responsibility for closure of Guantánamo Bay and the resettlement of detainees undoubtedly lies with the US Government. However, Europe needs to recognise the political reality that the US cannot manage this alone. We have expressed a lot of goodwill towards President Obama and commitment to transatlantic relations. That must imply an offer of practical assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also other reasons for EU Member States to cooperate in closing the prison. First of all, the humanitarian argument, which I hardly need to labour, to rescue these men from the hellhole in which some of them have suffered for seven years. Secondly, Europe’s credibility: we have called on the US to close Guantánamo, now we have to help to make that true. Thirdly, our own self-interest in ending a potent symbol that acts as a pretext for terrorist recruitment and radicalisation and, lastly, the moral responsibility that Claudio Fava was talking about.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I think we will deal with rendition and the collusion by European governments in a second motion for a resolution in two weeks’ time. So, I strongly welcome the joint resolution that we have agreed between the groups and across the political spectrum, and I really hope we will have a strong vote tomorrow. Assuming the ALDE Group accepts my advice, we will neither table nor support any amendments to this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just want to deal with a couple of things. Firstly, the allegations about 61 released detainees having become involved in terrorism: we have heard from lawyers who know about these things that this is largely baseless. We know of two who have become involved in terrorism. Others include those, like the eight people in Albania, who gave interviews to the media; the so-called ‘Tipton Three’, British citizens who made a film criticising Guantánamo. That is not ‘returning to terrorism’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, concerning the security issues: we need to discuss those, but credible solutions are being put forward, and we can involve the lawyers in that.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, after Barack Obama’s election as president of the United States of America, and his signature of the document on the forthcoming closure of the Guantánamo detention centre, an unhealthy excitement was felt in this House. Members of the now dissolved Temporary Committee on CIA Affairs took the floor. I would remind the House that the aforementioned Committee did not contrive to establish anything, although it was at pains to express its outrage and to condemn types of so-called extraordinary rendition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We already know now that the new President appreciates the serious nature of the problem. He has modified his stance since the election campaign and shortly after being sworn, in he issued a regulation extending the period in which the methods used to date in dealing with terrorists may be employed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We realise that for many Member States of the European Union, including Poland, it is impossible to accept arrested terrorists. Nonetheless, Member States of the Union and our Parliament, instead of criticising and weakening the front in the war on terror, should cooperate with the United States and take upon themselves part of the responsibility for combating this phenomenon. I must remind the House once more that terrorism is a global threat that also affects Union citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the prison camp at Guantánamo has become a symbol of contempt for human rights and the rule of law. The new US president Barack Obama has given out an equally powerful and essential message by ordering the end of the military tribunals in Guantánamo and promising to close the camp within a year.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is not only the United States of America which has lost credibility as a result of its contempt for human rights in the war against terror. Our European governments cannot disclaim responsibility, as the Temporary Committee of the European Parliament on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners established in its report in February 2007. This exposes the double standards of many countries in the European Union, who rightly demand that candidate states uphold human rights, but themselves trample on human rights within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union also has the responsibility of playing an active role in the process of finding a joint solution for all the prisoners who are no longer under suspicion and who cannot return to their home countries. This applies specifically to Germany which can, and should, help to make the acceptance of refugees a possibility. We must not repeat the mistake we made in the case of the German Turk from Bremen, Murat Kurnaz, who wrongly spent four years in Guantánamo Bay.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new beginning in Washington is an opportunity for us to send a clear signal that human rights must not be eroded in the war against terror.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it is my hope and wish that President Obama’s statement on the closing of the Guantánamo detention centre will herald a change in US foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope it will mean the rejection of a policy that repaid terror with terror and crime with crime, one that, ultimately, rode roughshod over international law.</p>
      <p sl="es">My hope and wish is for this to be the case. The problem for the European Union is that many European states have been committed to Mr Bush’s former policy of repaying crime with crime and torture with torture. And they have been accomplices in that policy. This is why the committee of inquiry into CIA flights could not finish its work: there were European governments that were hiding their shameful acts, the shameful acts of Mr Bush’s foreign policy. And this is why we must insist they be held accountable. The American people have done so through the polls.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also hope that President Obama shows courage and brings to justice those officials who have tortured and those officials who have detained people illegally, because, ladies and gentlemen, for the Guantánamo prisoners, there is only one solution as far as the law is concerned. If there is proof against any of them, they should be tried. If there is no proof, then they must be released. And US Administration officials must take responsibility for those people who have been detained illegally.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think it is not our role to act as an outlet for the arbitrary policy which the United States of America has unfortunately been deliberately pursuing in this area. The policy flies in the face of our common Western principles and is being conducted in a cynically chosen area which is a relic of colonial times. There is no rule of law there: neither Cuban law, which, as Mr Dillen rightly said, affords no protection to the individual, nor US law, nor our common heritage of international law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In legal terms, I think the issue is clear. If there are criminal charges under common law against some of the prisoners, they should be judged by due process of law. If they are suspected, for example, of having organised the attacks of 11 September, they should have been told seven years ago of the charges they face, had access to lawyers and appeared before the American courts. There is no shortage of these in the United States of America.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If others are considered to be prisoners of war following the Allied intervention in Afghanistan, they should be held in the conditions set out in the law relating to war until hostilities officially end.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If there are detainees who fall into neither of these two categories, then they should be freed and sent home.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am told that some are potentially dangerous, but if I personally were detained for seven years in complete isolation, whilst I might not have been potentially dangerous to begin with, I would certainly have become potentially dangerous by the end. I believe this is the case for most people here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If some do not wish to go home, they can ask their gaolers for political asylum. That is all I have to say and, in passing, I wish to thank Mr Barrot for his investigative work. Time will show it to have been the best analysis of these illegal transfers of prisoners.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, this House called for the closure of the prison at Guantánamo Bay several times. We were joined by the other two institutions: the Commission and the Council. Now that the decision has been made, let there be no mistake about our position. We heartily congratulate President Obama on this decision, one that he justified with the need to reinvest the United States with the moral authority which it previously enjoyed in the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us be clear: the Bush Administration’s decision to open the prison at Guantánamo Bay, as well as the ‘extraordinary renditions’ programme, was a blow to that moral authority. The ends do not justify the means. It is not acceptable for international law to be violated, for torture to be carried out, for secret prisons to be opened or for prisoners to be made to disappear. In states governed by the rule of law, prisoners are brought to justice and have the right to defend themselves. The Bush Administration was wrong to commit these abuses, just as its accomplices, whether through conniving applause or ashamed silence, were also wrong.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the United States requests the help of the European Union, it must not be refused – just, in fact, as Mr Barrot said – provided that we do not forego our citizens’ safety, but without using that as a pretext for non-collaboration. We also need the collaboration of the United States in order to shed light on the abuses that were committed in Europe, to investigate who was responsible and to ensure that the same crimes will not be repeated in the future. We must also ask the Member States and European institutions what they have done to implement the recommendations that this Parliament adopted in February 2007 and, where applicable, what explanation they give for not having done so.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Since Mr Fava referred to President Barroso here, I believe that a word of thanks is owed to him because, unlike the Council, which resisted, lied to and hid information from this House, the European Commission behaved loyally and collaborated fully with our investigations.</p>

      <p sl="nl">President Obama has kept his word. One of his first policy actions was the closure of the prison in Guantánamo, which we are naturally delighted about. Or rather, it was the announcement of the closure of Guantánamo, because the new US Government is faced with the difficult task of finding a solution for the inmates who are still there.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, their status should be identified, and it should be established whether they can all be released without risk. They have been locked up illegally by the Bush administration, which clearly violated international law. It is, therefore, first and foremost an American problem that needs to be solved by Washington. Whether the US will ask for help from the European countries and the European Union is currently not yet clear, and it would be somewhat speculative to run ahead of events too much.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also beg to differ with those fellow Members who believe that we should already make pledges on the basis of the assumption that the European Union is morally obliged to do so, because some countries could possibly have been involved in the transport of inmates to Guantánamo. This is based purely on assumptions. We have never been able to prove that there was any truth in this, and neither do we know which countries would have been involved in such transport, so to base our argument for receiving inmates on this is somewhat weak, in my view, and I am pleased that this has not been done in the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should, obviously, not rule out the possibility of the US still making this request, and I share my group chairman’s opinion on this. If this request is made, we will certainly need to react positively on account of considerations of international law, but also on account of the need for the European Union to react in a humanitarian manner in a situation like this.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Guantánamo is a problem that was not created by the European Union. It is a problem that, to be sure, would not exist if the European Union – as well as condemning it so many times – had truly rejected it, rather than passively and, at times, actively, collaborating in the very existence of that black hole of international law. Yet it is clear that we did not create it ourselves. However, we most certainly do have a duty to cooperate in order to put an end to this situation. This is a clear duty that we should carry out.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no doubt that each case must be dealt with individually. The prisoners of Guantánamo cannot be dealt with as if they were an undifferentiated herd. They are people with rights, but also with their own personal stories. Some of them are criminals who must be tried as such; some are innocent and some, no doubt, are potentially dangerous.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Having failed to take the lead against the exemption from international law in the fight against terrorism, the Union is now attempting to go along with Mr Obama’s commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This explains why we have this still timid call from members encouraging Member States to receive those innocent detainees who cannot return to their own countries for fear of torture. This is done not out of solidarity, nor charity, nor even generosity, but purely to comply with our international commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Beyond the message sent by Mr Obama, will Europe be able to raise itself up, will Europe not only be able to investigate, target and assume its responsibilities, but also bring an end to its illegal complicity in extraordinary rendition? Will Europe be able to reform the control of its own secret services? Will the Union be able to rehabilitate the victims via legal processes and compensation?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome Mr Barrot’s declaration of intent to this end. I have to say, however, that whilst we are finding out more and more about what the ex-prime minister of Portugal covered up between 2002 and 2004, the results of his initiatives as the head of the European Commission to get the Union out of this grey area of non-legality remain completely unknown to us.</p>

      <p sl="it">The first point of the resolution mentions the important changes in United States’ policy concerning humanitarian laws. I see some changes, certainly in tone, but also considerable continuity with the politics of the ‘detested’ Bush, given that President Obama has not abandoned the programme of extraordinary renditions and CIA prisons in foreign countries. I say this for the attention of the Czech Presidency, which seems to have a different idea. I would not wish Obama enthusiasts to suffer any early disappointment.</p>
      <p sl="it">Anti-US propaganda, already active in the CIA committee two years ago, has returned in the oral question on CIA flights in Europe. I shall give you just one example: in one recital, the existence of a secret CIA organisation in Poland is exposed. Now the fact that there is a CIA organisation in a country like Poland should not come as a shock – it would be strange if there were not – but I believe that the signatories to the question are annoyed that this organisation should be secret. They would always want secret services to act without secrecy, openly, and the CIA aeroplanes to have ‘CIA’ displayed on their aircraft as if they were British Airways or Air France. Here again, I fear that they are going to be disappointed: not even Obama would go that far.</p>

As far as this is concerned, unfortunately, Europe also obviously bears responsibility as regards the fight against terrorism. One very serious cause for concern is the fact that the only national parliament which has invited the European Parliament to present the conclusions and recommendations of its committee on the CIA is the American Congress.

It is not acceptable to say now that this problem is not our business. It is even less acceptable to say that the closing of Guantánamo and the ensuing consequences are exclusively the US Government’s problem.</p>
      <p sl="es">For years, US secret service aircraft have been flying around Europe with impunity, transporting detainees, while we have turned a blind eye. We should, therefore, shoulder our responsibilities and not only demand the immediate closure of Guantánamo but also accept some of the prisoners who, unable to return to their own countries or, indeed, stay in the United States, demand that other countries, European countries included, be able to take them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Portugal has already promised to do so, and I believe this is partly due to a certain feeling of responsibility and guilt. Spain’s own guilt is just as great, at least, and I therefore take this opportunity to call on the Spanish Government to take in some of those people, to make that commitment, as Portugal has done and as many organisations have asked us to do.

      <p sl="ro">Combating terrorism is the number one priority of modern society. However, mistakes have been committed and controversial decisions have been made in the name of this desired objective. The closure of the Guantánamo detention facility, which has been a blemish on the image of the civilised world during the last decade, is a just decision of paramount importance. The next normal step would be for this measure to be followed by the United States resolving the situation of the people currently being held in detention. The European Union and the United States have championed, and still do champion, respect for human rights and respect for human dignity, and they should therefore work together to correct the mistakes that have been made.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that before raising the issue of accepting the inmates in Europe, it is absolutely necessary to make available all the information relating to possible terrorist activities which the latter were involved in or to possible membership of a terrorist group. A detailed check must be carried out on this information, along with an objective evaluation of the possible repercussions which allowing inmates to return to their country of residence could have. An official request from the United States is an absolute necessity and I believe that the decision to accept inmates in Europe must be up to Member States, while those which make this decision must also bear in mind that they are assuming these responsibilities on behalf of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As regards Commissioner Barrot’s reference to Romania, accusations have been made in the past without any basis. However, Romania has responded to all the enquiries from the European institutions, received the CIA committee and supplied all the relevant information.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is no question that the responsibility for Guantánamo lies with the USA. However, it is an act of solidarity to help and support Barack Obama to return to the rule of international law when he asks us to do so. I am thinking, for example, about the Uighurs who cannot return to China. However, we also need to consider the people who have spent five or seven years in Guantánamo. We cannot decide whether or not they want to live in the USA. That is their choice. For example, the city of Munich and the Uighurs who live there would be ready to accept these Uighur people and to support and care for them so that they can come to terms with their traumatic experiences.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, one thing must be made clear. It is not acceptable for the Bavarian Interior Minister, Joachim Hermann, to say: ‘Everyone who is held in Guantánamo must have committed a crime’. The right to the presumption of innocence must apply in this case. As the head of a police authority, this minister should pack his bags and go.

We made it very clear that the establishment of Guantánamo represents a breach of international law and a violation of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The then newly elected German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, also said this in the presence of President Bush on her first visit to Washington and she also demanded the release of Mr Kurnaz. I believe that President Obama’s decision is a good one and that it will help to restore the credibility of the United States of America and of the Western world as a whole. For this reason, we must make it clear that the question of credibility is of great political importance.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we must establish that the prisoners there should not be regarded as peaceful human rights campaigners and that they must be judged on that basis. During the course of this debate, I have sometimes had a quite different impression. We must ensure that the United States of America takes primary responsibility in this case and that it explains why it cannot accept many of these prisoners. The home countries of these people must also explain why they do not want to accept them or the prisoners must prove that they cannot return to their home countries because they would be exposed to serious persecution.</p>
      <p sl="de">When all this has taken place, we can begin to consider whether the European Union should accept some of the prisoners. However, this is only possible once we have investigated in every single case the extent of the risk posed by each person.

I think we should ensure that those people who have a link with our Member States should be accepted, such as Mr Kurnaz in Germany or the nine people, I believe, in Great Britain. In total, I think 60 people have already been taken in by the European Union and we should not forget this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Portugal urged an EU agreement on resettling persons from Guantánamo, and this is strategic for transatlantic solidarity as well as being a humanitarian gesture towards people cleared of suspicion who endured detention, torture and deprivation of justice. However, it is also a duty for 14 EU States which colluded with the Bush Administration in subcontracting torture to Guantánamo and secret prisons, as this Parliament pointed out. European responsibility for violations of the rule of law and human rights cannot be erased.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the position of the European Parliament on Guantánamo was set out in a special resolution in 2006. Guantánamo should never have been created and it needed to be closed. The position of the European Parliament on terrorism is equally clear. We want to combat terrorism with all legal means; we do not want to combat terrorism by infringing human rights and international law. It is a fact that the United States has shouldered most of the burden in the fight against terrorism. However, they have also made huge mistakes. It was a huge mistake to create Guantánamo. It was a huge mistake to treat detainees as they did. It was a huge mistake to transport them as they did. This has been said in this Parliament. What is important today is that President Obama has made the right decision to close this prison of shame and this decision both speaks well of America and is true to the history of America and of the international community in general.</p>
      <p sl="el">How is the European Union involved? The European Union is involved in that it wants to support and help with the implementation of this correct decision by President Obama. However, the European Union should do this on one condition: that it does not put the safety of its citizens at risk. This is a basic requirement and whatever is decided by any Member State should therefore be decided from this point of view.</p>

      <p sl="es">In this Parliament we have, for some time, denounced the torture and inhumane, humiliating treatment being used at the Guantánamo military base in the name of the fight against international terrorism. We therefore welcome President Obama’s decision to suspend trials for four months and his intention to close the prison permanently within one year.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, even though the responsibility lies with the US Government, the European Union cannot look the other way but should offer its assistance in order to guarantee closure of the detention centre.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the terrorists have declared a cruel, bloody and uncompromising war on our civilisation. They wish to destroy our world, which is founded on respect for human rights and devotion to freedom. The attack on September 11 demonstrated that terrorists are prepared to use any means whatsoever. The United States undertook to defend the free world on behalf of us all. Close cooperation between Europe and the United States offers the only hope for success and destruction of the terrorist networks. Europe needs to feel responsible for the war on global terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is right that human rights defenders drew attention to violation of these rights, and to the use of humiliating methods during interrogations at Guantánamo. Often, these methods amounted to torture. It is right, too, that attention was drawn to detention without trial, and without the right to defence counsel. No means deemed inadmissible under signed international conventions may be used.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The newly elected President of the United States has already issued a regulation banning the use of torture during hearings involving terrorist suspects. It is right and proper to interpret this as a victory for all those who raised the alarm on this matter. Pursuant to this same regulation, however, it will still be possible to kidnap terrorists and hold them for short periods in transit countries. In a nutshell, respect for prisoners’ dignity is increased but, at the same time, the possibility of effectively paralysing terrorist activity must remain, otherwise we would be in danger of becoming helpless.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should also like to draw the attention of the House that on the same island where the Guantánamo detention centre is located, political prisoners are being held in prison conditions that violate every conceivable standard. These people have been condemned to long years in prison because they dared to oppose the Communist propaganda of the tyrannous Fidel Castro.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Chechen nation was murdered before our very eyes. So far as I am aware, the European Parliament did not set up a special committee to deal with that. The United States has recognised that the use of torture is inadmissible, as is the existence of secret prisons. That should put an end to the debate on secret prisons and transit flights.</p>

We can be helpful, but if we are helpful, if there is no other way, this is only possible on the basis of a European decision, European standards which we will need to establish jointly.

Some of them have not even been charged and duly tried. Obama made a popular gesture and is now deciding what to do with them. He should, above all, persuade Congress to change the law so that the prisoners can be transferred to US soil and some can be given a new identity. It is an extremely hot potato: after release, 60 Guantánamo prisoners returned to terrorist activity, and therefore each case should be examined individually. The Czech Presidency’s negotiations on a solution for Guantánamo are an opportunity to emphasise that dialogue between the United States, Europe and Cuba on changes on the totalitarian ‘island of freedom’ begins with human rights, and not only the human rights of prisoners at the American base. Above all, this dialogue should entail the release of political prisoners in Cuba, and freedom of speech and movement for innocent Cuban citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">I do not regret the detention of the most dangerous terrorists intent on destroying our way of life when they were proven to be so. However, one of Guantánamo’s major drawbacks was that it forestalled any regular criminal proceedings against those held there. Ultimately, regular criminal trials are the only way to resolve the status of Guantánamo prisoners who are non-EU nationals.</p>

I should also like to state quite clearly, that even if Portugal or another country consents to take in 20 such prisoners, that does not mean that those people will wish to remain in Portugal or in any other given country. The Union is now a unit, and this problem must therefore be considered. Finally, the appropriate procedures should be used so that such people are no longer stigmatised as suspects or as dangerous. Unless they are freed from such stigma, nobody will wish to accept them. This is a serious problem that merits consideration.

    <intervention id="2-316" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Alexandr Vondra" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for this debate. I believe it was very useful. If you had listened to the debate in the last Council meeting during lunch, you would have seen a similar will to cope with the problem, but also an appreciation of the complexity of the problem we are discussing. It has a moral and political dimension, but also a security and legal dimension.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all agree that President Obama’s decision to close Guantánamo was an important and good one, which we all appreciate and which is applauded by practically all of you here. But now that we are discussing the consequences and what we can do to express solidarity – and our interest here is to act in transatlantic harmony – we, of course, see that the problem is a complex one. Martin Schulz has said that we cannot fight terrorism and, at the same time, get into a conflict over fundamental rights. He is perfectly right, but Hartmut Nassauer has said that there are two dimensions: one is the moral one and the other concerns security. He is also right, and that is exactly why the Ministers for Justice and home affairs have to discuss this as well. From the political perspective, it is not just a flexing of moral muscles, nor should we approach this problem just out of guilt. It is certainly more complex than that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Graham Watson spoke of the need to approach this with one voice. Again, he is certainly right but, at the same time – because this also concerns the legal problem and the competence issue – we cannot force Member States to invite the detainees from Guantánamo on demand. If you had to solve this problem by deciding to invite those detainees to your homes – imagine taking on the responsibility of the Ministers for the Interior – you would certainly think twice about how this problem is to be handled. I certainly do not think it should be approached by the Council and the Member States as an issue of horse-trading – not at all. It is not about washing ourselves but not getting wet. At the core of the problem is simply the fact that the decision to close Guantánamo is, of course, the primary responsibility of the United States, the country which built the facility. But we have – and have to have – the goodwill to express solidarity and to be cooperative in solving the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also the tactical debate. Should we offer this on a gold plate now, or should we wait until a request has been made? But if we do receive a request, we need to be prepared to react. Therefore, the Council started to discuss this seriously on the second day after President Obama’s decision. I do not think we can underestimate the security issue – as you have pointed out – as it is a simple fact that some of the inmates who were released re-engaged in terrorist activity, and it is a simple matter of fact that one man, Mr Said al-Shihri, is now the deputy head of al-Qa’ida in Yemen. So the US has to start the serious work of clearing up who those people are, and we have to break with them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legally, I think we have to be aware that the decision on the admission of foreign nationals to EU Member States is the national competence of the Member States. This is one level. However, on a second level, there is the agreement that we should now work towards a European framework in which to embed the national decision. Both the Schengen and the Dublin Agreements call for a European approach because the security of all Schengen members will be affected in some way by the decision of the individual Member States. So there is an internal imperative for a coordinated approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the EU is looking into the possibility of assisting the US with the resettlement and rehabilitation of former detainees in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you have raised the question of speed: can we act faster than we are doing now? I think we should be aware that the discussion has only just begun. It has only been one week. The questions that have to be addressed are really complex and will need some time, although President Obama himself has requested a review of the prisoners’ files and has set a one-year deadline for the closure of Guantánamo. One should not expect the Council to be ready to fix all these complex problems in a matter of a few days.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, it has to be kept in mind that the primary responsibility for Guantánamo rests with the US. Although the Member States express their readiness to work on a coordinated approach, the issue has a bilateral dimension as well as the multilateral one. A clear position of the respective Member States on the resettlement of detainees is not yet known. The meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, which is to take place later this month, will be very useful here. In the meantime, the anti-terrorist coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, is also working on various option papers here.</p>
      <p sl="en">So that is my summary on Guantánamo, which occupied most of the time. On the other issue of illegal detention, Mr Fava’s favourite issue, I will just repeat what has been said several times by my predecessors: the allegation concerned the involvement of national intelligence agencies; the supervision of those agencies is the responsibility of individual Member States, and the Council has no power here to act beyond what was done.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Commission broadly shares the views expressed by Mr Vondra.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even so, I would like to say that, after this long debate, we are at a major turning point. It is a key turning point in the fight against terrorism. We have to try, henceforth, to take on this fight with a restored moral authority for the entire Western community, fight whilst respecting fundamental values and fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe must then lead the entire international community towards a desire to fight terrorism in the spirit of those self-same fundamental values which gave rise to the fight in the first place. It is a key turning point and Parliament’s declaration is, in this regard, extremely useful, as it assumes that all of the Member States have the will to participate in this major change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true, however, that initial responsibility lies with the United States. They have to verify the status of each detainee before they make an official request for transfer to an EU Member State. This really is the essential condition. The United States must send us a clear and reasoned request for each individual case. That is absolutely essential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the end, it is, of course, up to each Member State to decide if they are willing to receive an ex-detainee from Guantánamo, but the debate has shown that cooperation at a European level is evidently very, very desirable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Coordination will be beneficial in determining the legal status of ex-detainees and will also be necessary to protect Member States in the case of diplomatic or other requests from the countries of origin of these detainees. This coordination will be needed to reassure the Member States, in particular, and I am thinking about what Mr Nassauer said, those with worries about public order and security.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A coordinated European approach could finally give us greater leverage in negotiations with the United States over access to documents and transfer processes. We could then possibly add financial assistance to facilitate reception in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would say in Mr Vondra’s presence that we will naturally work closely with the Czech Presidency. With Mr de Kerchove, we are also in the process of writing the study document which will serve as a basis for the discussion to take place at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 26 February.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will also say here that we will no doubt use our visit to Washington with Mr Langer, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Interior, to raise all of the issues relating to and consequent upon the closure of Guantánamo with our US colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We now have to deal very seriously with this issue and make legal preparations to respond on a case-by-case basis to the US request. We have to take this very, very seriously, taking into account, of course this desire for positive cooperation in this new fight against terrorism, which will include compliance with the fundamental values which unite us and which have to unite the world community.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The recent decisions of the Government of the United States have simply confirmed – as if it were necessary – that which has long been denounced: the existence of a US-sponsored kidnapping, torture and illegal detention network.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These decisions must not serve as a whitewash for the responsibility of the United States and of the governments of European Union countries for systematic violations of international law and of the most basic human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As before, we must demand a complete end to such ignoble practices and an investigation into the truth, including EU governments’ culpability regarding the use of their airspace and territory to imprison and transfer illegally detained prisoners to, for example, the US military base at Guantánamo Bay. This is all the more necessary in light of reports that the clandestine US operations called ‘extraordinary renditions’ – in other words, the illegal detention and transportation of citizens – have not been called into question by the new US Administration.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Accordingly, we are opposed to any agreement between states or between the United States and the EU regarding the ‘transfer of prisoners’ detained in Guantánamo. This does not mean that decisions and requests freely expressed by individuals, specifically for asylum in Portugal, cannot be considered within a framework of respect for national sovereignty, the Portuguese Constitution and international law, including the right to asylum.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European Union proved an incomprehensively lackadaisical community when it did not take any firm diplomatic action in the context of international organisations to condemn, on the basis of human rights, the illegal activity the United States of America was engaged in.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The action taken by the new President shows that that activity is regarded as illegal and intolerable on ethical and moral grounds. This is all about the EU’s commitment to America’s illicit behaviour while it tailed behind the old US President, and in the eyes of free EU citizens, that means that the EU lost face and respect. May the EU be ashamed of its failure to act.</p>

    <intervention id="2-324" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Alexandr Vondra" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you on the issue of the situation in the immigration and detention centres situated in the European Union, of which you have highlighted two in particular, i.e. Mayotte and Lampedusa. I am very aware of the close interest you have shown in these centres, of the various visits which some of you have made, and of the concerns you have expressed about the conditions in some of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to begin by underlining two fundamental principles which lie at the heart of today’s debate. The first is the need, in the case of third-country nationals requiring international protection, for full compliance with the commitments which we have given, as enshrined in various international instruments. The second is that we respect fully the human rights and the dignity of migrants and members of their families.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are all very aware of the pressure resulting from migrants entering the European Union, as well as those seeking asylum here. This pressure is particularly great along the Union’s southern and eastern borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have responded by developing, over the last 10 years, an effective EU asylum and migration policy. However, the significant increase in the level of arrivals underlines the need for this policy to be strengthened and further developed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to do this internally in order to establish our own common standards and rules in the area of asylum and migration, but we also need to act externally, in partnership with countries of origin and transit, in order to manage migration flows more efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="en">All parties stand to gain by such an approach. The development and shaping of an EU asylum and migration policy depends on your input too. I am grateful to Parliament for its positive contribution and I am sure that we can work constructively on further developing this important policy area.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have specifically raised the situation on the islands of Mayotte and Lampedusa. We should take care to distinguish between the two types of migratory flows in these two cases. The migratory flows affecting Lampedusa and Mayotte can be characterised as mixed ones: some of the third-country nationals concerned have claimed international protection, others certainly fall into the category of economic immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the first category – those who claim international protection – I would draw your attention to the existence of minimum standards for the protection of asylum seekers, set out in Directive 2003/9/EC, which was adopted in 2003. This Directive has already been transposed into the national law of the Member States and it is for the Commission to ensure that the provisions set out in this Directive are properly and fully applied.</p>
      <p sl="en">In December 2008, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and to the Council a proposal to amend and update this directive. Since the codecision procedure applies here, the European Parliament will be fully involved in the negotiations on this new proposal. The Council will shortly begin consideration of this new proposal and looks forward to working closely with you.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members will be aware that, in the specific case of the French overseas territory of Mayotte, Community law does not apply.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the second category – other third-country nationals who have unlawfully entered the territory of a Member State – the competent authorities of the Member States are entitled to detain those falling into this category prior to the adoption of a return decision, and/or with a view to facilitating its enforcement. Detention may prove to be the only option in cases where it is necessary to seek identification of third-country nationals without travel documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until now, the legislation and practice regarding detention in the Member States has varied considerably. The recently adopted European Parliament and Council Directive on common standards and procedures for returning illegally staying third-country nationals has introduced specific principles and rules on detention, and so goes some way to establishing a common legal framework in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">This directive clearly states that detention for the purposes of removal may be used only where less coercive measures cannot be applied in a particular case and only on specific, very limited grounds. Furthermore, the directive provides that detention shall be for as short a period as possible, shall require a decision in writing with reasons in fact and law, and shall be subject to judicial review at regular intervals. It should also be stressed that the directive provides for clear upper limits of detention and the grounds on which – in limited specific cases – a detention period may be prolonged, but not longer than a maximum term.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the conditions of detention, the directive makes clear that detention shall take place as a rule in specialised detention facilities – or, in any case, away from ordinary prisoners – and that the rights of the detainees – especially those of vulnerable status including minors and families – shall be observed.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the return of illegal immigrants is concerned, the recently adopted European Parliament and Council Directive on common standards and procedures for returning illegally staying third-country nationals is already in force. Its provisions now have to be transposed by Member States into their national law within a deadline of two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">This overall legal framework underlines our strong commitment to ensuring that third-country nationals who are held in detention for the purpose of removal are treated in a humane and dignified manner, and that their fundamental rights are fully respected. It also, through the most recent legislation, sets commonly agreed standards on return policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">This framework is not only in line with the principles I set out at the beginning of my statement, but actually gives them legal force. Our asylum and migration policy is thus rooted in the rule of law. It ensures respect for human rights and for the dignity of the individual.</p>

    <intervention id="2-325" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacques Barrot" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as Mr Vondra has just pointed out, we now indeed have a legal framework which is beginning to assert itself. It has made its presence felt first by the Return Directive, which is the first horizontal document to harmonise return standards in the Member States. It brings into Community law the applicable provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and its implementation will allow the application of Community control mechanisms for checking compliance with the acquis .</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am well aware, however, that some of you find this directive insufficient. For me, though, it constitutes a Community control resource that can be used for checking compliance with the acquis . Of course, by monitoring its implementation, and let me remind you that the time limit for transposition is 24 December 2010, the Commission will ensure the strict observance of the fundamental principles as regards respect for the rights of migrants and it will assess, in particular, the impact of the provisions on detention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have myself said that I will monitor the transposition closely to ensure that no Member States use it as a pretext to extend the detention periods to which they currently adhere. Others, who had unlimited detention, will be expected to comply with the time limits set out in the directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second text on which we will base our actions is that adopted by the Commissioners on 3 December 2008 on accommodation conditions for asylum seekers. I hope, Mr Deprez, that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs might examine this text in the near future so that we can make progress with this new policy on asylum.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would point out that this text includes clear rules on detention, in full compliance with the fundamental rights, and limits detention to exceptional cases. We are, of course, talking here about asylum seekers. Secondly, it takes greater account of the needs of vulnerable asylum seekers and will make it easier for them to gain access to the jobs market. We therefore now have a legal framework and it must, of course, be put to use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now turn to the questions that Parliament wanted to raise in this debate. The Commission is aware of the difficult situation facing the Italian authorities with the mass arrivals of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers on that country’s southern shores, in particular, on Lampedusa. Up to now, Italy has been able to give access to its territory, saving the lives of many migrants, whilst introducing a procedure which can be used to examine requests for asylum in appropriate conditions. The Commission also notes that Italy has recognised a need for international protection in half of all individual cases, thus showing that in these flows, there are asylum seekers alongside the illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For several years, the Commission has been finding the financial resources to support some Member States, including Italy. This is the case with the Presidium project and the European Refugee Fund emergency measures. In addition, a few weeks ago, the Commission approved emergency aid of EUR 7 million.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If Italy thinks it necessary, the Commission is ready to examine a new request for emergency aid from the 2009 budget to improve the reception structures on Lampedusa, in Sicily and on the mainland, thus increasing the Italian authorities’ ability to examine the individual situations of migrants in appropriate conditions. I will soon be going to Lampedusa, as well as to Malta, to examine the situation on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also well aware that one of the keys to the solution is the establishment of a solid framework for cooperation with Libya, the main country of transit on the migration routes from East Africa. I am relying on the efforts of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner to achieve a quick result in the current negotiations. That is indeed one of the keys and unless this negotiation is completed, it will be very difficult to confront all of the problems we face.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now turn to Mayotte. Whilst the Return Directive includes specific rules on detention conditions, with the emphasis especially on minors and families, these Community rules do not presently apply on the territory of Mayotte. The European Union recognises the territory of Mayotte as French, but it has the status of an overseas country or territory, not an outermost region. Therefore, private law does not apply, although it is true that France has to take into account the remarks and requests of the Council of Europe and I believe that the French authorities are currently looking at other reception conditions in Mayotte. That said, it is true that European law is not properly applicable, as Union law is not directly applicable in a territory that is not an outermost region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the remarks I wished to make to you. Once again, let me say to Parliament that the conditions for receiving illegal immigrants, particularly asylum seekers, are receiving my full attention and they really are a priority for me. That is why I will be making these visits to see how things are working on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like, in any case, to thank Parliament for having opened this debate.</p>

    <intervention id="2-326" speaker_id="4340" name="Margie Sudre" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Vondra, ladies and gentlemen, our Parliament takes pride in its unceasing defence of the respect for human dignity in all circumstances, including, of course, the conditions in which illegal immigrants are held.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will concentrate on the case of the administrative detention centre in Mayotte, with whose problems I am very familiar. The differences in the standards of living and economic and social development between the islands of this Indian Ocean archipelago incite many Comorans to cross the 70 kilometres that separate them from Mayotte, which is a French department as you said Mr Barrot and, as an OCT, is not a European territory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">People residing illegally on the island of Mayotte account for 30% of the population. Yes, you heard correctly, I said 30% of the population. This is a percentage which is unknown in our European countries, thank God. It obviously has a major impact on Mahorais society, and represents a source of serious difficulties for public infrastructures and services, crime and illegal working.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The French authorities are well aware of these difficulties. Work to renovate the current detention centre has just been completed to improve the living conditions of detainees significantly. Besides these temporary measures, the French Government has also decided to build a new detention centre with a more suitable capacity and in accordance with national standards. This should be open in June 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has just adopted common rules so that it can take its share of legal world immigration but we should not hide the fact that certain regions are faced with extreme situations. Stigmatising the Mayotte detention centre will not bring a quicker or more effective solution, as the pressure of migration is subjecting the island to such a tension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mayotte is on the verge of taking historic decisions for its future, in order to become a French overseas department and then join the territory of the Community by gaining the status of an outermost region of the Union, I believe that the Mahorais have greater need of our assistance than our criticisms.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘To thwart illegal immigration, one has to be unkind. Immigrants come because it is easy to get here and no one sends them away, but precisely for this reason we have decided on a change of tune’: these are the words of the Italian Minister for the Interior, Mr Maroni. It seems a parody of a policy and yet it is the policy of the Italian Government. It seems clear to me that inherent in this policy is a profound contempt for what we are discussing here and for the rules that the European Union gives us.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, we have spoken about the closure of Guantánamo. I think that we need to speak urgently about the closure of Lampedusa: about the Centre for Temporary Stay and Assistance in Lampedusa, as it has been pictured in recent months, namely as an open-air prison. The Presidency has rightly recalled the legal framework, referred to also by Mr Barrot – the use of coercion only in exceptional cases, detention only on absolutely clear grounds and for as short a period as possible – a legal framework that is substantively and formally violated every day in Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Most of those who are in Lampedusa are asylum seekers. The Council recalled the minimum standards envisaged by a Directive on asylum seekers adopted in 2003; these rules are being substantively and formally violated. We often have 180 days of detention, including for those who are fleeing from political persecution or war. All this, of course, constitutes acts of legal barbarism which, however, are measured by the numbers offered to us by newspapers. 1 200 people died in 2008 when trying to cross the Mediterranean. Of those who managed to survive, many went through the torments of Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, Mr Vice-President, I invite you to visit Lampedusa, as you yourself have promised, to go there soon, and (if I may make a suggestion) to announce at the last moment that you are going to Lampedusa. Otherwise they will smarten up the Centre like a ballroom for you and make you imagine that this is the detention centre that we are talking about this evening.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The reports about the tragedies unfolding at our external borders are as plain as day. The urgency is great, and has been for a while. This is also what the Council has noted time and again – but only on paper. With all due respect, President-in-Office of the Council, and we are, of course, grateful for your contribution, but we have been here before. It is all empty words and no action. It could almost be considered ironic that we are also voting on the Roure report this week. This report contains our findings further to our visits to all the hot spots, including Lampedusa. The European Union is falling short, and not just by a little.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What we would like to know, President-in-Office of the Council, is whether you have taken the trouble to read our interim reports at all? Tampere, the Hague programme, the French Pact on immigration and asylum and soon the Stockholm programme: all these fine words are in stark contrast with reality. It is, after all, this reality that demonstrates to us that the European Union is still a long way off when it comes to facing up to its responsibility. The lack of solidarity is shocking. Nobody, not one single person in this Parliament, is suggesting that this is a simple task. Of course it is difficult to face up to large waves of immigrants and asylum seekers adequately, but this is nothing new.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The review of existing instruments has now got underway, but I already have doubts as to whether this will yield the desired results. Experience has taught us that the Council tends to cry off at crucial moments. The fact is that while, in theory, the Member States are aiming for far-reaching harmonisation, in practice they take decisions that have exactly the opposite effect. The largest common denominator suddenly appears to be minimal then, or this is what my experience has been over the past five years. And this is quite apart from enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As I already stated earlier today in a different debate, it should be clear that neither the European Commission nor the European Parliament have magic wands at their disposal because, at the end of the day, it is the Council and the Member States that will have to take action in this area.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that for electoral reasons, Mr Fava has been compelled to say a series of things that are not true. After the electoral campaign, I shall bring them to his attention. However, he takes such an interest in the problem of Lampedusa that he has already left the House – a House that ought to express its gratitude for the generous welcome accorded in recent years by the citizens of Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Instead, we must emphasise the European Union’s delay in solving the many problems linked to illegal immigration and in allocating support and aid to at-risk countries with external borders. Some countries have not shown the welcome given by Italy to thousands of desperate people who risked being drowned in the sea, thanks to people traffickers and the inertia of many non-European governments who have not respected and signed the agreements for the control of illegal immigration. We call for specific financial assistance to go directly to the people who live in frontier zones and who are more exposed geographically to the arrival of illegal immigrants. Assistance could also be given by creating free zones which would lead to the investment of resources and fiscal relief, not to be taken into account in the agreements on the Stability Pact.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is clear from your speeches that international and Community law is being violated daily in Lampedusa. However, all your statements remain formal and reflect wishful thinking that will not be followed by action. I fear that this especially applies to your statement, Mr Vondra.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am wondering whether the European Union has any means for bringing this situation to an end: there is unlawful detention, the aberrant retention conditions are obvious, and there is a risk that the right to asylum will be virtually eliminated. The European Union is the only organisation, and Mr Barrot knows this very well, that can get Italy and other countries out of this situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why, Commissioner, I am very worried by the announcement of new money for Italy without conditions. How will it be spent? Is the Commissioner aware that the much criticised monitoring – in other words, cataloguing – of the Roma last year had financial support from Europe? It is something that is included in your press releases. Therefore, what sort of trust can we have in action of this kind?</p>

    <intervention id="2-331" speaker_id="28979" name="Giusto Catania" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday Mr Maroni announced that one had to be unkind to illegal immigrants, but for days and months, Mr Maroni has been practising unkindness towards migrants whose position is irregular.</p>
      <p sl="it">I say this because the Lampedusa emergency, the so-called Lampedusa emergency which has now lasted for 10 years – therefore it seems to me to be a bit of a pleonasm to go on calling it an emergency – was desired and created by the Italian Government. In fact, by choosing Mr Maroni, the government made a decision not to allow any more migrants to leave Lampedusa. The Centre for Temporary Stay has had at least 1 800 people shut up in there without the government arranging for any of them to be transferred. They are held in such inhumane and degrading conditions that the centre exploded into a true democratic emergency.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now I believe that this is the true Lampedusa emergency, that is to say, the need to establish a sort of juridical free zone, a place where migrants would enter and be deported without each case being examined individually. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees states that at least 75% of those who arrive by sea in Italy and gain the right to asylum request it. Thus, if Mr Maroni’s practices were put into effect, the migrants would probably not have the right to asylum since they would immediately be deported directly from Lampedusa in accordance with the wishes of the Italian Government.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence, there is a genuine emergency and the cause of it is Italian government policy. The citizens of Lampedusa have become aware of this, Mrs Muscardini. Indeed, they have carried out a general strike against the government, against its immigration policy, in order that the centre for immediate expulsion from that place – the centre for identification and expulsion – should not be opened. They have also asked the Italian Government to modify its position on the Centre for Temporary Stay.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is good of Commissioner Barrot to go to Lampedusa in the next few days and I appreciate this. I have prepared a dossier and sent it to Mr Barrot. In the next few days, my group, too, will organise a delegation that will visit Lampedusa.</p>

      <p sl="nl">It is now a good two or three years ago, in 2005 and 2006, that a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs visited various refugee centres. After Lampedusa, visits were also made to places including the Canary Islands, the Netherlands and Poland. The reports on those visits resulted in heated debates, and this Parliament urged the Council and Commission to take action.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This morning, we discussed the proposal to tackle illegal employment in the absence of the Council. The period within which the Member States have to transpose these directives into legislation is two years. The issue of immigration is urgent, though, and a two-year period is too long. We have been debating Lampedusa for three years now, and each time, we discuss measures to drive back illegal immigration. After each measure, though, it turns out that, after a brief reduction, there is an increase in immigrants. It is shocking that the reception situation at Lampedusa should need to be discussed in this manner again. Parliament reports regarding the reception situation appear to be completely ineffective. I would therefore call on the Council Presidency to make this a priority.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I understand that, in 2007, more than 12 000 immigrants arrived at Lampedusa, and this figure rose to more than 30 000 in 2008. The detention centre was not built to cope with this capacity. We have known this for three years. The old NATO base is being rebuilt to house more immigrants, but this is not an adequate solution. I should like to hear from the Council what you will do to back the Italian initiatives for better reception facilities. Is this, perhaps, something Frontex could do, and are other Member States prepared to support Italy financially and equipment-wise?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last night, on the 8 o’clock news, the whole of the Netherlands witnessed what the situation at Lampedusa is like, but the door has now been closed again to journalists and NGOs alike. I would call on Italy to be open and transparent about the treatment of immigrants on Lampedusa.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Everyone has been aware of the problems surrounding Lampedusa for years. Capsized ships with unfortunate asylum seekers before the European coasts were, in recent years, a regular occurrence. Tens of thousands of people try to reach Europe, enticed by unscrupulous human traffickers who are prepared to bring economic fortune hunters to Europe for huge sums of money.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do not intend to mince my words, though, when I say that Lampedusa’s plight is, first and foremost, the result of the failure of European immigration policy and should not be attributed to the Italian local authorities or the people of Lampedusa. Europe should dare to send clear messages, for desperate times call for desperate measures. We should come down hard on human traffickers, and their punishments cannot be severe enough. This should go hand in hand with a strict asylum policy, one that demonstrates to the rest of the world that Europe is serious about protecting its borders.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe should follow the example of the Swiss, who decided two years ago to tighten up legal conditions for immigration and asylum. It is the only way of sending human traffickers and economic fortune hunters a clear message that Europe is prepared to protect its borders to avoid social catastrophes. Only then will a debate such as the one we are holding today prove unnecessary in future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing in this House surprises me any more. However, someone who declared in July last year, concerning the same topic, that he was ashamed to be an Italian citizen would have no choice but to make the assertions that Mr Fava has now made. I am sorry that he is not here in the House. It would be interesting to know how many votes he gains in his city and how many constituents he represents.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, Mr President, some ignorant and stupid things have been said by some people on this occasion. I hope and believe that Commissioner Barrot will indeed pay an early visit to Malta, Lampedusa and so on and realise how wrong it is that the European Community lacks a policy on this matter, because the truth, Mr Barrot, Mr Vondra, is precisely this: there is no Community policy. What is the consequence of this? That some stupid ignorant people can be allowed to attack what are, in fact, the tragic realities experienced by citizens, individuals and, above all, national governments.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that it is important to give you a few figures. In 2007, around 11 000 migrants arrived in Lampedusa. In 2008, three times as many arrived, about 31 000. It is not true that the number of asylum seekers corresponded to the total number; they made up about one tenth of the total. Two thousand migrants arrived in just the three days from 26 to 28 December, that is to say on St Stephen’s Day and just after Christmas. 76 requests were examined in 3 days. Of these 76 requests for asylum, 36 had a positive outcome, 3 were suspended and the rest … I have nearly finished, Mr President. After the assertions that have been made, be patient. Then Mrs Frassoni will reply when you wish, when it seems right to you and in any circumstances; there is no problem.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now what counts are the true facts: Lampedusa and Malta and others are carrying a terrible burden. The citizens are not annoyed with the Italian Government. They are annoyed because they themselves can no longer endure this situation. Therefore, this Parliament, rather than accusing the lawful authorities who are doing as much as they can, should instead try to get the European Union to carry out its obligations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The situation is difficult for this small island which, in 2008 alone, had to cope with the arrival of almost 31 700 immigrants. These massive flows have been brought under control in recent years as these migrants have been sent to other centres on the Italian mainland.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These transfers were interrupted following a decision taken by the Minister for the Interior and we are seeing a serious deterioration in the situation. However, the Presidium project, which is jointly managed by the Ministry of the Interior, the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Italian Red Cross and part-funded by the Union, has become an example of good management of migrant reception. The decision to end the transfers to Italy is creating a real problem of access to asylum procedures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for Mayotte, since 2007, we have known that the nominal capacity of the Pamandzi centre has been exceeded. It became known that 204 people, generally minors, were being housed there, while the maximum capacity is for 60 people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The current conditions are catastrophic: the men are sleeping on the floor; there is no distribution of any bedding or toiletries and men, women and children have to use the same lavatories. The detention conditions are degrading and an affront to human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The pressure of migration is indeed felt more strongly in these territories, but the dignity of each person must be ensured and each case should be investigated in accordance with the law. It has already been stated that we have an unavoidable need for a real European policy on asylum and immigration and for solidarity at the Union level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have been making this request to the European Parliament for several years and we are therefore making a fresh appeal to the Council.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you are a thoroughly sensible person and I therefore invite you, and in so doing, associate myself with other Members, to go to Lampedusa and, I beg you, to go without prior warning, so that you find out in person how difficult it is to manage an emergency situation of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the situation of an island of only a few square kilometres where thousands and thousands of people have been continuously disembarking for many years – and during this period, left- and right-wing governments have come and gone. Some of these people die during the journey because of the inhumane conditions to which they are subjected by unscrupulous people traffickers. What therefore should be done: ignore the rules? In order to proceed to possible repatriation or to check whether they have political refugee status or need to be granted political asylum, these people have to be identified and this obviously takes time. Enough then of demagoguery! Italy is paying a price in terms of very heavy responsibility which is disproportionate to the support, both financial and legislative, that is given by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Unfortunately, no country can have unrestricted immigration in this world. The differences between the different countries are too large, and that is why we have the problems that we are talking about now. Those who come normally present themselves as asylum seekers. When that happens, we must preserve the rule of law. We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect. We must protect their human rights pending examination of the question of whether they are asylum seekers or not. What we are talking about now seems very strange to me.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Why should those who arrive on the island of Lampedusa be forced to remain there forever? As the previous speaker said, if people pour into a small town in southern Sweden, for example, we do not expect them to remain there. They will, naturally, be relocated around the country pending legal examination of their case. The same must be done in Italy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the struggle against illegal immigration, given its extent and consequences, is a problem that must be resolved at Community level, since only the European Union has the necessary political clout to identify effective solutions and control the phenomenon. No individual State, operating on its own, can achieve the required results.</p>
      <p sl="it">While waiting for Europe to implement its strategies, the Italian Government is pressing ahead with work on both the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, adopted by the European Council in October 2008, and the Return Directive of December 2008. This is important work at both domestic and international level.</p>
      <p sl="it">At domestic level, there has been much criticism, unfair in my opinion, of Interior Minister Maroni’s proposal for a Centre for Identification and Expulsion on the island to implement, for specific cases, a policy of direct repatriation. This option does not compromise the fundamental rights of illegal immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, as has been claimed by several parties. To prove this, I will cite just a few figures on Lampedusa that have already been given: 76 requests were examined in January 2009; of these, 36 were granted, three were deferred and 37 were refused. All asylum seekers, by contrast, were transferred from the island to the centres in Trapani, Bari and Crotone. That is to say, those who qualify are accepted.</p>
      <p sl="it">At international level, the Italian Parliament is today ratifying the agreement with Libya, Article 19 of which expressly states that a more effective control system on Libya’s land frontiers should be established to prevent illegal immigration. Furthermore, Ministers Maroni and Frattini met the Tunisian authorities last week to try to conclude an agreement on readmission with that country, an essential condition for sustainable repatriation. The concept that must be accepted here in Parliament, as Vice-President Barrot has also said, is that we must be absolutely firm towards illegal immigration but, at the same time, be welcoming and supportive towards those who become integrated and contribute to the social and economic development of our countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barrot, I welcome the fact that you want to visit Lampedusa, but I recommend that you go there soon and without giving advance notice, otherwise you will find that you are presented with a mere sham. When we visited, the camp had been cleared and the detainees replaced by puppets. You should also go quickly before Mr Berlusconi and Mr Maroni turn Lampedusa into Europe’s new Alcatraz and continue to keep the citizens there in captivity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we in the European Union must show solidarity. We must establish quotas for refugees which are distributed across the different Member States and which also include the refugees who come across the ‘green border’. These represent quite a significant number.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is happening here – and we have visited many camps – is appalling and completely inhumane. Mr Berlusconi says that they can all go and have a beer whenever they want to. This shows the level of intelligence which this man has, in other words, none at all. I want to make this very clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is people like Mr Maroni who say that we must be tough and apply the full force of the law and then go and kneel on the Vatican steps on Sunday and claim that they are good Catholics. This two-faced approach is no longer acceptable. We must support the other Member States, such as Malta, Greece and Italy, but not these hypocrites. We should not help them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has to decide: does it want regulated immigration or the invasion and criminal exploitation of illegal immigrants? The Italian Government has made the right choice: to detain the illegal immigrants in Lampedusa and, at the same time, renegotiate repatriation agreements with the countries from which they come.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, this requires adequate means and Europe must not merely discuss, merely criticise, merely look at the problem through binoculars. Europe must certainly come to Lampedusa and help our country and those others who maintain the Maroni line on this problem. Today, 120 illegal immigrants are going back to Tunisia from Lampedusa, something not done by previous governments because the immigrants had to be taken back – thus drawing the teeth of the exploitative Mafia criminals who cause these journeys to be made and then exploit them for criminal trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="it">An anti-Mafia professional like Mr Fava should be able to understand it, it is not difficult, he too should understand it. The Maroni line is approved by Malta, Greece and Cyprus, and by those who live near the southern frontier of our country. All asylum seekers and all minors have already been transferred to appropriate centres. What has been said is false. If Mrs Roure wants to go to Lampedusa tomorrow morning, she will not find a single minor, and if she reads the Italian newspapers, she will discover that it was Mr Maroni who exposed trafficking in organs: children used to disappear from Lampedusa when we had a Left government in our country. Maroni exposed this. Well, the message is clear: people must enter Europe only legally, not by means of Mafia boats and criminal traffickers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must give priority to the careful treatment of refugees. In Europe, we are all familiar with the concept of compulsory school attendance. We should start by allowing the people who are stranded here to have a proper education. Language teaching and vocational training are both urgently needed, together with the opportunity to learn about European culture so that the time spent in these detention camps is not wasted, but instead we help people to help themselves. This should be our main objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps we can include a preparatory measure in the budget to allow us to offer these people educational opportunities. They have come to Europe in desperation and we should be able to give them a basic framework to enable them to be successful in their home countries and to play an active role in promoting democracy and freedom.</p>

      <p sl="mt">I was pleased to hear Commissioner Barrot say that he even plans on visiting Malta, and I assure the Commissioner that he will have no problem finding the immigrants in centres in Malta, for the simple reason that Malta cannot simply take these immigrants and move or transfer them to some other place, and this is partly why the situation in my country is so difficult. Mr President, last Sunday, a boat carrying 260 immigrants landed on our shores. To make it more comprehensible to the Commissioner, this is equivalent to 39 000 immigrants arriving in France or in Italy in one day. To place it in a clearer context for Minister Vondra, this is the equivalent of 7 000 immigrants arriving in the Czech Republic in one day. The 2 000 arriving in Lampedusa over Christmas is nothing compared to this! What is needed therefore, in a case as sensitive as this, is not criticism towards the country’s authorities but solidarity in order to put a stop to this flow and lighten the burden. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to remind you what the Lampedusans want. At this moment, the Lampedusans are protesting and almost all of them marched the other day in the island’s streets, because they want neither the Centre for Temporary Stay nor the Centre for Identification and Expulsion, which is the latest idea. The latter was to be created on an island which, let us remember, is eleven kilometres long and three kilometres wide: a ludicrous amount of space when faced with the thousands of immigrants who will arrive there in the next few months.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other day, just when there was the sudden and unexpected escape of 1 000 immigrants from the Centre for Temporary Stay, I was on the island and observed the consternation and fear of the people who live there and no longer want to witness things of this kind. This is an island that has lived off fishing and tourism and sees its own economy being destroyed by a blind immigration policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">I have noticed one thing and that is that more than half of the debate was devoted to internal Italian politics. This is a legitimate concern, but I suggest that the debate should primarily take place in Rome and not here in the European Parliament. We are discussing a European issue here and we should include one additional point in the discussion. Hardly any of the speeches have referred to the fact that this issue concerns not only refugees, asylum seekers and economic immigrants to Europe, but it is also, to a large degree, about finally putting an end to organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="de">None of the people who come to Lampedusa or Malta have organised a boat for themselves. They come because they have been enticed by organised crime organisations and have paid a great deal of money.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank you for a very constructive and helpful debate. There are things the Council can do; there are other things which the Council is not obliged to do or which do not fall within its remit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with the negatives – the limitations. As has already been stated, it does not fall within the Council’s remit to monitor the implementation of Community law by the Member States; that falls to the Commission, and my colleague Commissioner Barrot talked about that, and we are certainly working closely with the Commission on many issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also does not fall within the Council’s remit to implement national provisions of the Member States. A lot has been said during this particular debate about the countries most involved: Italy and France. On the other hand, we certainly have the will and the instruments to act, and the Council is willing to act in the future. I think we all agree – I was listening to you carefully, because you were talking about the further need to improve EU action in the area of migration and asylum policy – that a lot was done last year and I think we are all grateful to the French Presidency for taking the initiative in promoting the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which specifically mentions some instruments of solidarity. Now is the time to gradually implement that step by step. Certainly Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, will have the possibility to work together on that. I can just promise you that our Presidency, as well as the upcoming Presidency – because this issue will not be resolved within the next few weeks – will be working hard on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are strategic issues. There are also issues that required more immediate reactions, such as reducing the risk of humanitarian crisis and the negative impact. I come from the Czech Republic, which is not under the media spotlight, but we have had our own experiences too: after the division of Czechoslovakia in 1992, there was a huge inflow – hundreds of thousands – of the Roma peoples from Slovakia into Czech territory. Perhaps it was not like the situation in Malta, where I understand the situation is particularly difficult, but I think everybody in the EU has some experience of that and, without a doubt, there is a need for us to work together.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-346" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacques Barrot" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as Mr Vondra, the deputy Prime Minister has said, the Commission must ensure that the rules are applied. However, Mr Vondra, the Member States must also cooperate and I think that with the Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the dynamism of your Presidency, together we will be able to do a good job.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have noted Members’ impatience during this debate, but it has to be said that it is still early days in the implementation of the pact and, as I just said, the legal framework is beginning to take shape and can be used as a support. Now, obviously, we must use this to arrive at a Community policy on asylum and a Community policy on immigration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe needs to show greater solidarity. I have just listened to Mr Busuttil and it is true that, faced with the influx of immigrants and asylum seekers, Member States like Malta find themselves in extremely difficult situations. Europe has to decide what solidarity is required. That is absolutely essential</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also say that we are trying to give as much help as we can via the European Refugee Fund. I would, however, say to Mrs Frassoni that there is probably an error, as the European Return Fund cannot be used, in any case, for registration of the Roma. That is not possible. That is not the aim of this fund. In any case, when I go to Lampedusa and Malta, I will see how the financial aid that we are giving to the Member States is being used.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore say to you that we are now going to pay a great deal of attention. We finally have a solid legal framework that will allow us to act much more than previously on reception conditions. I also hope that a more united Europe will allow an improvement of the situation of these immigrants, especially these asylum seekers who are worthy of our full attention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to reply to Mrs Sudre, since she gave a very good explanation of the extremely worrying situation in Mayotte. What she said is correct: the French authorities have informed us that a new centre with 140 places will open in 2010. Above all, these same authorities are currently negotiating with the Comoran authorities to conclude an agreement on movement and migration, as a lasting reduction must be made to the migration pressures on that island.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In general terms, I must say that we need the policy of partnership with the countries of origin. Mr Vondra, that is the condition we have to meet if we are to reduce somewhat the very high migration pressure on some of the Member States, for some of whom it is causing problems. However, I think that if the European Union can be very united, we could find an answer to the need for a more concerted management of migration flows. This will obviously benefit these men and women, whom we should never forget, and who are in very painful situations.</p>

    <intervention id="2-353" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Charlie McCreevy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">One month ago, Parliament adopted a resolution on the proposal for a directive on the procurement of defence and security equipment. This means that the proposal has successfully completed first reading and will shortly be adopted by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new directive is a major step forward towards the establishment of a common European defence market. It will introduce fair and transparent procurement rules applicable throughout the Union. This will enhance the openness of defence markets between Member States to the benefit of all. European industries will get a much larger home market and become more competitive; our armed forces will get better value for money, which will help to improve Europe’s defence capabilities; and last but not least, taxpayers will benefit from more efficiency in public spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the controversial issues during the debate on the directive were ‘offsets’ – that is, economic compensation for defence purchases from foreign suppliers. Some Member States proposed to include in the directive a compensation system which will allow them to secure such industrial returns on defence investments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Offsets aim at fostering the industry of the Member State which purchases defence equipment abroad. As such, they can lead to distortion of the internal market and imply discrimination against companies from other Member States on the basis of the nationality of the supplier. The EC Treaty prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality, and a directive, as secondary law, has to abide by the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Legal Service of the Council confirmed in its opinion of 28 October 2008 that, and I quote, ‘restrictive procurement measures designed to promote domestic industry do not comply with the general principles of the EC Treaty’. Consequently, offsets on defence procurement can only be permitted if they are necessary for the protection of essential security interests or justified on the basis of an overriding requirement of general interest. Economic interests, by contrast, are not sufficient. The vast majority of Member States and Parliament agreed with this assessment.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there was not only a legal obligation, but also a political consensus not to accept in the directive compensations directed at fostering national industries. Accordingly, neither the Commission in its proposal, nor the colegislators, namely the Council and the European Parliament, included specific rules on offsets in the text of the Defence Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Defence Directive does, however, offer alternatives to offsets. Member States which are principally purchasers of defence equipment usually seek to justify their wish to have offsets either with security of supply needs or with the necessity to open up defence markets for their SMEs. The Defence Procurement Directive will satisfy these concerns. On the one hand, it allows the contracting authorities to ask tenderers for specific commitments to satisfy their security of supply requirements. On the other hand, it contains provisions on subcontracting which make it possible to require tenderers to open up their supply chains to EU-wide competition and facilitate access for SMEs, as this will contribute to reconciling the legitimate security and economic interests of Member States that are purchasers and avoid the need to have recourse to compensations or offsets.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, Commissioner, I am obliged to tell you that we must not lose sight of the key issue from our point of view, and the key issue from our point of view is preventing purchaser countries, such as Portugal and others, from potentially being at a disadvantage.</p>

      <p sl="en">It was heavily debated in the various working groups, but the consensus, for the reasons I have outlined in my formal reply, was not to go down the route that the honourable Member suggested.

      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the recent cessation of hostilities in Gaza. It is vital that all parties make the current ceasefire permanent through the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1860. A number of issues need to be addressed without delay, in particular, the reopening of all crossings into and out of Gaza, a sustained halt to rocket attacks against Israel and an effective means to prevent arms-smuggling to Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now that the hostilities appear to have stopped, it will be important to resume talks aimed at comprehensive peace as soon as possible. The EU has called on its partners for help in driving the peace process forward. The immediate priority for the Commission is to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the population in Gaza. Trading relations between the EU and Israel will continue. Isolation, sanctions or any other forms of boycott would be harmful to talks and negotiations aimed at achieving a sustainable solution to the conflict. Furthermore, while targeting Israeli interests, they would also prove to be detrimental to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is economically dependent on Israel as a main destination for its exports and employment of its labour force.</p>

However, we should also take the time to explain on behalf of the European Union that people within the Gaza Strip have committed illegal violent acts which have a direct and fatal impact on the residents of Israel. I would be pleased if the European Union could provide a balanced response in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 35 by Boguslaw Sonik (H-0029/09)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Internet safety programme</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Decision No 1351/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 established a multiannual Community programme on protecting children using the Internet and other communications technologies. In accordance with this decision, the Commission is required to draw up annual work programmes as part of the ‘Safer Internet’ programme, which is designed to promote safer use of the Internet and new communications technologies. Given the threats posed by unlimited access to all these technologies and data, special attention needs to be paid to children and young people. The programme, which is to run from 1 January 2009 until 31 December 2013, has a budget of EUR 55 million.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Will the Commission give precise details of the plan of action and the costs of implementing the ‘Safer Internet’ programme in the coming years? Who is eligible to apply to take part in the programme? How, and on what activities, will funds from the ‘Safer Internet’ programme be spent?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-367" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Safer Internet Programme, a predecessor of the programme which is now being launched, was considered a real success. The Commission is convinced that the next one will also be a success.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Safer Internet Programme is a unique pan-European initiative through which the EU helps combat illegal content and harmful conduct online and increase awareness of child safety online among the European public. It facilitates national actions and initiatives in a coordinated fashion.</p>
      <p sl="en">As pointed out by the honourable Member, the new Safer Internet Programme, which will run for five years from 2009 to 2013, has a total budget of EUR 55 million and will be implemented through annual work programmes. The 2009 work programme is currently subject to Commission inter-service consultation. The Commission will then seek the Programme Management Committee’s favourable opinion. Thereafter, this document will be uploaded to the comitology register in order to allow the European Parliament to exercise its 30-day right of scrutiny, which should take place between the end of March and the beginning of April. The work programme defines the content criteria and indicative budget of the call for proposals which will be launched in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">The call for proposals will be open to all legal entities established in the Member States. It is also open to legal entities established in EFTA states that are contracting parties to the EEA Agreement – Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. It is, furthermore, open to legal entities established in other countries provided that a bilateral agreement is signed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2009 work programme is the first of five, and so will be a building block for the activities to be carried out over the whole lifetime of the programme. According to the current draft, its priorities are to empower and protect children by introducing new actions and continuing actions started under the previous Safer Internet Plus Programme, ensuring coverage of awareness activities, help lines and hotlines throughout the Member States, strengthening coordination at European level, and also ensuring value for money by obtaining maximum impact with the financial resources available, namely EUR 11 million per year.</p>

      <p sl="de">The question now is: Do you believe that overall, these developments are a good or a bad thing? Will the situation become more or less dangerous? If it is becoming more dangerous, what plans does the Commission have with particular regard to this change in the Internet?</p>

      <p sl="en">The dangers of the Internet and the development of the Internet constitute a huge issue. We all know how new the Internet is in our world and how it has developed exponentially over the last few years. As such, both the positive and dangerous sides are very new to society and governmental structures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, governmental structures, including European institutions, must adequately assess all the possible threats, and I am sure that they are doing so. The Safer Internet Programme is one response to threats already identified. Another threat already identified is cyber attacks and different attempts to attack and block via the Internet. Criminals are also using the Internet, and law-enforcement agencies are actively working on how to deal with these possible threats.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think that one of the main priorities for governments – and also European institutions – is to respond adequately; and in this sense, ‘adequately’ means that we should not restrict the enormous advantages which the Internet offers to all users.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, while all the different aspects of development threats and possibilities – and adequate reactions thereto – are definitely more a question for the specialists in this area, they are also in the interest of all Internet users. I can assure you that the Commission and its relevant services are monitoring the situation intensely.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning participation in this programme, the Commission’s attitude is that applications can come from a large variety of possible applicants, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and that those enterprises are mostly the providers of these kinds of services. Therefore, I think it would also be good for those enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I understood correctly about the possibility for the younger generations to participate in this programme, I cannot give you a concrete answer at this moment, but the Commission is very open to involving as many participants as possible to work with this programme. However, I cannot give a concrete answer today on the issue of young people’s participation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 36 by Ingeborg Gräßle (H-1043/08)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Special adviser Richard Boomer and the Heysel site</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Since 1 April 2006 the Belgian real estate entrepreneur, Richard Boomer, has been working as a special adviser to Commissioner Kallas on issues relating to buildings. His contract has now been extended.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What led the Commissioner to extend this contract? Which decisions by the Commissioner has Mr Boomer influenced? Which internal meetings in the Commission has Mr Boomer attended since the extension?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It now seems that another Belgian real estate promoter is seeking to bring pressure to bear to have some Commission offices located on the Heysel site in Brussels. Will the Commission give its opinion on this site? What is the timetable for decision making? When will the results of the architects' competition for the Rue de la Loi be announced?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-375" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">This question is very well known to me and has already been dealt with many times. I must say that, first of all, Mr Richard Boomer is not a property developer, as is stated in the question. All information about him is available on the website. He has been my special adviser since 1 April 2006 and his mandate was renewed in 2008 for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">His mandate as special adviser is as follows: advise the Vice-President responsible for administration, audit and fraud prevention as regards property policy; improve relations with the competent authorities in Brussels and Luxembourg; optimise effectiveness of the investments to be made by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must say that he has really provided us with valuable expertise, knowing what is going on in the real estate field in Brussels or Belgium mostly, though not so much in Luxembourg. His advice has been valuable and I must say that also the lines of command in the matter of property policy at the Commission are very clear. The definition of property policy falls within the competence of the Personnel and Administration DG under the authority of the Vice-President in charge of administration. This policy is implemented by the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics Brussels (for Brussels) and the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics Luxembourg (for Luxembourg). In his capacity as special adviser, Mr Boomer, like all special advisers at the Commission, advises on the policy and perspectives on a long-term basis in the matters laid down in his mandate. He has no role in the process of decision making or in the underlying management procedures such as, for example, the acquisition of buildings or the suspension of a long-term lease.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the third question, relating to an unnamed Belgian real estate entrepreneur, the Commission has no knowledge of the pressures suggested by the honourable Member.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the last question – the big one – I am very happy to inform the honourable Member that the European Commission announced publicly, in a communication on its property policy on 5 September, its will to maintain a strong symbolic presence at the centre of the European area, while developing in parallel up to three additional sites outside this area. This policy makes it possible to ensure the best added value for use of public money and puts downward pressure on the high level of prices within the European area. In accordance with this policy, the Commission published in June 2008 a call for information addressed to the market in order to have better knowledge of the existing possibilities for the development of a site external to the European area from 2014. This call was made with full transparency, via publication in the Official Journal. The Commission received nine offers and is currently undertaking a technical examination of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission would reassure honourable Members that the choice of the site to be made in 2009 will be based on careful examination of the merits of each offer, pursuant to clear procedures and in the best interests of the European Commission and the taxpayers’ money. Until this decision is taken, the Commission will not express a view on any of the offers which have been examined.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the question of when the results of the architects’ competition for Rue de la Loi will be announced, the Commission can only state that this question does not fall within the competence of the European Commission but has to be submitted to the Brussels Capital Region, which launched this town planning competition. According to information available to the European Commission, the final result is expected in spring 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sorry about the long answer but the details were also substantial.</p>

      <p sl="de">My question is as follows. As you yourself have said, Commissioner, nine parties have already shown interest in this call for information and are currently being evaluated. However, specific changes of use have been introduced at one site, the Heysel site. How does the information which you have just given us fit together with what is obviously already in preparation on this site? We would like some more specific information, in particular, about when we will be informed about the overall status and about the procedure.</p>

    <intervention id="2-379" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">You will be clearly informed about the full procedure and it can be scrutinised. It will be a very clear and transparent decision. The reason behind the idea of having so-called ‘other sites’ outside the European quarter is precisely because we want more efficient use of money.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we concentrate all our services in the European Quarter, it gives real estate developers enormous opportunities to ask very high prices, which we have already seen in many cases. So, to have other sites as well is a necessity, especially to moderate the costs. That is the main idea.</p>
      <p sl="en">We already have some buildings and some sites outside the European quarter. We have buildings in Beaulieu, we have buildings on the Rue de Genève and some others also. We are interested in looking. We have asked for 70 000 m2 to be proposed and we will then examine all the possibilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">You mentioned Heysel. I read about it in the newspapers. I do not know anything about Heysel. Yes, since I read this, several Belgian politicians have approached me and talked both for and against the site, but it has never been considered as some kind of preferred option. Nothing has been decided. It is a process.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is of big interest for Belgian and Brussels politicians, this location of the sites, and the Brussels Region is also interested in having our location outside the European Quarter, so we will make this decision. We have an assessment committee which is examining the proposal at the moment and then it will come before the OIB board and then later to the Commission. It will be a transparent process. I suggest, though, that we keep out of Belgian internal debates and interests.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Euro note and coin counterfeiting</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Community has developed a number of actions to protect the euro against counterfeiting, but in response to your question about the situation with regard to the fight against counterfeiting, it is as follows:</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2008, according to figures published by the European Central Bank, a total of 666 000 counterfeit euro banknotes were removed from circulation – so, a little over 600 000 compared to 20 billion genuine euro banknotes: this number is not too alarming. Historically, the 50-euro note has been the most counterfeited banknote, but in the second half of 2008 – for the first time – the most counterfeited banknote was the 20-euro banknote.</p>
      <p sl="en">For euro coins, a total of 100 095 counterfeits were removed from circulation in 2008, which represents a decrease of 7% compared to 2007, and the two-euro coin has always been by far the most counterfeited euro coin.</p>
      <p sl="en">So it is closely monitored. The roles are divided. The European Central Bank is responsible for the coordination of the fight against counterfeiting of euro banknotes. The Commission, especially its OLAF service, deals with the counterfeiting of coins.</p>
      <p sl="en">The real law enforcement happens at Member State level, but the coordination is carried out by the European Central Bank. We have a Technical and Scientific Centre, which carries out the analysis and classification of new stamped counterfeit coins.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to mention that Europol is playing a substantial role in fighting counterfeiting. So this is the situation with regard to the counterfeiting of euro banknotes and coins.</p>

      <p sl="en">In order to address the issue of counterfeiting, I believe it is vitally important to have the maximum cooperation between the police, the European Central Bank, which you have already referred to, and the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could you outline to me the current situation regarding this level of cooperation, and if you are particularly satisfied that the level of cooperation is good enough and strong enough?</p>

      <p sl="en">Therefore, I think that the situation is more or less satisfactory, compared to several other areas where cooperation is not so good. But in the area of counterfeiting, the Commission has no indication that there is a problem in cooperation between Europol and national law-enforcement agencies. On the contrary, Europol has specialists from national law-enforcement agencies there, and they are working closely together to fight counterfeiting.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me put it another way – is there an incentive, if you are a counterfeiter, to ply your trade in one state rather than another because the sentences there are less severe? In the United States, to counterfeit the currency is a serious crime. Do we take the same attitude in the European Union?</p>

      <p sl="en">First, the Turkish lira is very well known to me. This is not a question for the European Central Bank, but I have myself, during a visit to Turkey, addressed this issue with members of the Turkish Government, and they promised to gradually phase out this coin and change it so it will not be so similar to European coins. So this has been promised at least. That was already a couple of years ago and this has not been raised any more, so probably this process is ongoing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding cooperation, in early 2009, there was a big operation against counterfeiters together with the Italian authorities, so cooperation is working.</p>
      <p sl="en">About court sentences, this is, of course, a matter for national judiciaries and it is more of a question for my colleague Mr Barrot, but I have never heard of the European Union launching any initiative to harmonise these sentences. However, I know from the country I know best, and from other countries, that counterfeiting is a severe crime everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, as I said, there is quite a lot of cooperation among the law-enforcement agencies in fighting the people who are involved in these activities but, as far as I know, there is no initiative to harmonise such legislation all over Europe.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Efficient spending of the EU budget</p>
      <p sl="unknown">With the coming into force of the EU budget for 2009, how is the Commission continuing to ensure that the money of the EU taxpayer is used to its maximum efficiency and waste kept to an absolute minimum?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-388" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I could, of course, speak for at least one hour on these issues. Our doings in this area are reflected in the ongoing discharge process and in many communications from the Commission, in many discharge resolutions and in many speeches in the Budgetary Control Committee. So, firstly, I can assure you that we are dealing very seriously with these issues and the situation is improving.</p>
      <p sl="en">The system is as follows. The budgetary authority, which means Parliament, authorises the Commission to use money and which money can be used to implement Community policies. There is a special spending programme, which has its own legal basis. Parliament also designs this legal basis, so the rules are decided by the budgetary authority relating to the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next comes implementation, where there are different layers. One of these is, of course, the Commission, which is the main actor responsible for implementing the budget. Our activities in improving financial governance are reflected in our annual activity reports, and the Court of Auditors has evaluated that they are getting better and better and more adequately reflect the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one internal part. Another is the control and auditing systems, which have also been strengthened in recent years, for instance in internal policies in the research family, where we have increased the control and auditing staff. What is also important in this particular part is that there is shared management. Much also depends on the contribution of, and efforts made by, Member States to cut back their errors and to avoid the misuse of money. There is also improvement in this area. A completely new instrument has been introduced – the so-called annual summary of all reports of paying agencies. These were carefully analysed for the first time last year and this is now being done again.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the situation is improving. The Court of Auditors’ report, which also has been greatly changed from the beginning of our period, now quantifies the changes. This quantification of changes also shows that there has been an improvement. So European money is quite rigidly managed – even too rigidly in some areas. We can show what has been done. But we can also clearly say that this is far from perfect. This is a huge machine which must work smoothly. According to the Court of Auditors’ estimations, in most areas, 98% of all transactions are carried out without errors. In the Structural Funds, this is almost 90%, so the vast majority of transactions will not include errors, and any errors will be corrected. The number of correction decisions relating to the Structural Funds has increased tremendously during this period. I can, of course, provide you with a lot of numbers if needed. These are some indications, but of course it is clear that this does not cover the whole of the answer to the simple question: ‘How do you manage the European budget?’</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-389" speaker_id="28112" name="Gay Mitchell" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Is the Commissioner aware that the Court of Auditors said there were unacceptable spending errors in all but two of the seven policy areas covered under the EUR 140 billion budget? And, yes, there have been improvements: the auditors estimated that at least 12% of the Cohesion Fund should not have been paid last year and it was down to 11% this year – that is an improvement. But 11% represented EUR 462 million. Does the Commissioner think that this is acceptable?</p>
      <p sl="en">In other policy areas – agriculture, the environment, external aid, development and enlargement, research, energy and transport, education and citizenship – the error rate (I use the word ‘error’) was between 2% and 5% and the auditors observed that there was a ‘disproportionately’ (that is their word) large error rate for rural development, which now represents 20% of farm spending and is increasing.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a mess, Commissioner! Can we expect that this is going to be improved?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-390" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Of course it must be improved, but you must also understand that we are talking about errors. For instance, the 12% figure for last year is based on samples taken by the Court of Auditors, using absolutely correct methodology. These samples amount to EUR 63 million. All these samples have been corrected, recovered and the necessary documents provided. Therefore, the 12% issue from 2006 is resolved.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Agreements with Andean Community countries</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In view of the institutional problems the Andean Community is currently facing, does the Commission believe that a joint agreement with the Andean Community is still possible, or does it think that individual agreements with one or more CAN members would be more feasible?</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you for this opportunity to deal with the very interesting issue of our foreign policy on the Andean Community.</p>
      <p sl="en">Region-to-region negotiations with the Andean Community entered an impasse last summer due to the Andean Community’s inability to agree on common negotiation positions in certain trade-related areas. These differences reflect, to a certain extent, the differing approaches of the various countries in the region on economic and trade policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the efforts undertaken by some Andean Community countries to overcome this impasse, the Commission could only note that a consensus on moving forward with negotiations no longer existed. Under these circumstances, and without abandoning the medium-term objective of building an association between the Andean Community and the European Union, the Commission proposed to the Council a new two-track negotiating format which was approved by the Council on 19 January.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, and with the objective of preserving and strengthening relations between the European Union and the Andean Community, the Commission proposes to enrich and update the 2003 political dialogue and cooperation agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the Commission proposes to negotiate the multiparty trade agreement outside the Andean Community framework with those countries that are ready and able to commit to ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible trade negotiations. All of them are invited, of course.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taking into account the discrepancies among the Andean Community countries on the trade part of association agreements, the Commission believes that the proposed approach is the best suited to permit us to move forward in a pragmatic and constructive way, while continuing to support the Andean Community and Andean integration.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: The removal of the PMOI from the EU's Terrorist List</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 4 December 2008, the Court of First Instance (CFI) annulled the Council's 15 July 2008 Decision to maintain the People’s Mujahedin (PMOI) on the EU terrorist list.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The verdict emphasised that the PMOI’s right of defence and effective judicial protection had been violated by the Council which had also failed to prove that the PMOI was engaged in terrorism. The verdict added that the file submitted by the French Government was not based on ‘serious and credible evidence’ and that it was in respect of individuals suspected of being members of the PMOI and not the PMOI itself.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This verdict is the last of six rulings by the High Court and the Court of Appeal in Britain, as well as the CFI, in favour of the PMOI, all of which emphasise that the PMOI is not involved in terrorism and does not plan to engage in terrorism.</p>

    <intervention id="2-403" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">As you all know, the European Union condemns terrorism in all its forms and firmly believes that the fight against terrorism must respect human rights in order to be effective and credible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sanctions against terrorists are taken in the context of the common foreign and security policy, and the Commission is associated with decisions taken unanimously by the Member States in the Council. So the Commission has taken good note of the fact that, in its judgment of 4 December 2008, the Court of First Instance annulled the Council Decision of 15 July 2008 that listed the People’s Mujahedin Organisation of Iran (PMOI) as a terrorist organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court argued that the PMOI’s right of defence and the right to effective judicial protection had not been respected. In particular, the reasons for the listing had not been communicated in advance of the decision. The organisation was therefore not in a position to make its views known before a decision was taken. In application of that judgment, the Council adopted, on 26 January 2009, a new list of persons and entities subject to the restrictive measures applied to terrorist organisations, and the People’s Mujahedin Organisation of Iran was not included in that list.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that respect, it is also important to note that, in an attachment of 23 October 2008, the European Court of Justice confirmed that the current procedure for listing terrorist organisations, as applied by the Council in the case of sanctions that are not based on the United Nations sanctions, respects the human rights of the persons and organisations concerned. This includes a procedure in which both sides are heard, the reasons for listing are given in advance and the person or entity in question can make its views known.</p>

    <intervention id="2-404" speaker_id="4382" name="Avril Doyle" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">I should like to thank the Commissioner. Indeed, when I tabled this question on 17 December 2008, I was not to know the good news that would come from the Foreign Ministers’ meeting on 26 December.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make it clear that I condemn terrorism in all its forms. But, at the same time, I must ask you whether it is acceptable that any Council of Ministers can consistently refuse to uphold the rule of law and can ignore the judgments of the Court of First Instance.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Court of Justice said that the decision did not meet the substantive and procedural requirements, and the Council followed that decision. This was discussed in GAERC, and the Council decided not to keep this organisation on the new terrorist list adopted on 26 January 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I have not been informed that we have had any reaction from the Iranian Government. On the contrary, colleagues say that there has been no reaction from the Iranian Government.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Future EU-Iceland relations</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Iceland is a member of EFTA, most of EU-Iceland economic relations fall under the EEA, Iceland is an associate member of the Schengen agreement and has many other trade, economic and social ties to the EU. The impacts of the financial crisis triggered some talk of Iceland, while remaining outside the EU, joining the Eurozone. What impact would such a move have on EU-Iceland relations − notably in the fields of environmental and maritime/fisheries cooperation − and does the European Commission have in place provisions to deal with such a development? Is it possible that such a move, if it occurs, could be followed by similar agreements with other non-EU States?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-409" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">This has definitely become a matter for very intensive discussions which we could not have imagined a year ago. We could not have imagined discussing the potential radical changes in EU-Iceland relations. The question is what impact an Icelandic adoption of the euro – without Iceland joining the EU – would have on EU-Iceland relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first stress that currently, as we speak, there is an intense debate ongoing in Iceland on its relations with the EU, including the issue of European Union membership. The Commission is closely following this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question of Iceland applying for EU membership is entirely for the Icelandic people to decide and, should there be an application from Iceland, the Commission and the Member States will act according to the established procedures as laid down in the Treaty. I can assure you that we will handle the application as expediently as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the specific question of Iceland adopting the euro without joining the EU, of course Iceland can unilaterally take such a decision but it should be clearly stated that it is the Commission’s firm view, as well as a view of the European Central Bank, that unilateral ‘euro-isation’ is not a desirable political option for Iceland. Such a move would not have a positive impact on EU-Iceland relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iceland is a potential applicant for EU membership, thus Iceland should pursue long-term monetary integration with the euro area only in the context of an EU membership perspective. This means that Iceland should adopt the euro only after accession to the EU, after fulfilling the conditions set out by the Treaty.</p>

The negotiations will be the same as with all other candidate countries. I do not see any possibility of having some kind of fast track for these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whether Iceland is, perhaps, quite well prepared for membership is another issue. I do not know to what extent it has already adopted legislation similar to that of the European Union, because this is a major issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">At any rate, I am sure that Member States will be of the opinion that the position must be scrupulously fair and equal for all possible applicants. This is my opinion. There has never been any talk in the Commission of any special treatment or fast track.</p>

      <p sl="en">But, of course, Iceland has a population just under 300 000, so it is small and would not be a big burden on the European economy. I think that the basic idea is that it would make a contribution, so it is an economy that can overcome the current difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the Member States will watch it very carefully and will ask it first to put its house in order. That is the first requirement, and then there can be the question of the contribution Iceland can make to the Union’s economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the fisheries agreement, again, this is a very specific question. However, I seem to remember that this issue was mentioned several times in previous enlargement negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the fisheries question will be the most complicated in negotiating with Iceland, because it has quite big privileges which will definitely be contested by certain Member States. I think this will be the key element in future negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not know to what extent the existing agreement is applicable or suitable for future relations between Iceland and other EU Member States.

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the renewed social agenda adopted in July 2008, the Commission undertook to attend to the needs of an ageing population. The issue of an ageing European society calls for a range of strategic measures, starting with an assessment of the necessary reforms to the health and pensions system in order to provide for the needs of an ageing population, and taking account of the sustainability of public funds for supporting research into ways in which information technology can contribute towards improving the health and living conditions of older people.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission is now completing the draft Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2009, which will send a clear signal on the need to ensure long-term adequacy and sustainability of incomes, make the provision of healthcare more effective, and reduce inequalities in the field of health. It will also attend to the challenges which some Member States must tackle in the field of pensions, healthcare and long-term care. These are described in the attached surveys of individual countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Decision making lies within the authority of the Member States, when it comes to policy on support for those providing care informally for family members. However, the Commission may act as a catalyst for change, to support efforts of Member States. Within the scope of the open method of coordination in the field of social protection and social inclusion, the Commission is endeavouring to encourage Member States to create policies which support family members.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In the joint report for 2008, the Commission and the Member States emphasise the importance of policies on informal carers, including a set of measures such as opportunities for training and counselling, respite care, leave for care purposes, and suitable social protection for informal carers. In addition, the Commission supports the creation of these policies at national level through its contribution in the form of studies and conferences on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you for your answer, Commissioner. You talk about the needs of an ageing population. Certainly care-giving is one of those. You mentioned pension scheme reforms, and I am pleased to hear that, because people who give up work, very often to care for children or older persons, do not pay adequate social security contributions, and it is often carers who do not have adequate pensions.</p>
      <p sl="en">You mentioned that family carers come within the remit of the Member States, and I agree with that. You also mentioned in reply to me that the European Social Fund could be used for training. I would like you perhaps to elaborate more on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, carers work: they are unpaid workers. I am interested in your views on how you regard carers from that perspective under the heading of employment and social affairs, which is your own DG.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-420" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">In each case, in all Commission documents, we are working in the awareness that with an ageing population, increasing numbers of people will be engaged in caring for a dependent. Likewise, an absolutely clear policy of gender equality is being maintained, because one of the risks of unplanned development is that it is women who take responsibility, to a far greater extent, for ailing family members who, in many cases, are very old people. As for the funding for these people, that is a matter for the Member States. The Member States can develop the most varied schemes for supporting those caring for dependents and most Member States have some such scheme.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Since you have mentioned the European Social Fund, I would say that understandably, the European Social Fund cannot take on the financing of care for dependents, but it can develop and help to develop a whole range of important programmes for carers. Training, which I have mentioned, focuses especially on the fact that if we wish to care for someone who is perhaps close to us, and with whom we have an emotional bond, then despite all our efforts and goodwill, caring for another person is actually, in a sense, a specialised field. It is therefore a very good thing for these people to gain some basic knowledge and basic experience, because the results are beneficial for them, too: not only is the standard of care greatly improved, but their task becomes considerably easier. This is one of the reasons why we are aiming in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to emphasise something which has not been mentioned, but which we are also attending to, and that is the abuse or mistreatment of older people. In most cases, it again becomes clear that mistreatment is not due to some general character defect in the people responsible, but is due, very often, to a situational fault. The task is simply too difficult and they cannot cope. We wish to take action on this issue too, through the European Social Fund.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with the introduction of the Lisbon strategy, the European Union set itself an ambitious goal: to significantly reduce poverty by 2010. Since then, the Union has set up instruments for achieving that goal. The open method of coordination in the field of social protection and social inclusion has helped to strengthen the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and has supported the efforts of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This cooperation between Member States has had very good results. I shall mention three examples: there are now 22 Member States that have set themselves a target figure for combating child poverty; citizens and companies are now very closely involved in the national strategies to combat poverty; and social inclusion strategies have been incorporated into many policy areas: employment, education and vocational training, health and housing. All the relevant policies have therefore been brought to bear in the fight against social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The renewed social agenda which the Commission adopted on 2 July 2008 sets seven priority areas of activity, including the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The renewed social agenda also proposes strengthening the open method of coordination. The European plan to stimulate growth and employment, which was submitted to the heads of states and governments at the European Summit in December 2008, aims to address the impact of the financial and economic crisis and also to strengthen the reforms already under way within the scope of the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission has also undertaken to regularly monitor the social impact of the financial and economic crisis in the Member States and the measures taken at national level. This tool for monitoring the social impact of the crisis should be published quarterly, and understandably it would focus mainly on the most vulnerable groups.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission will also continue to cooperate with the Member States to ensure effective implementation of its recommendations adopted in October 2008 on the active inclusion of people who are furthest removed from the job market. In particular, the aim of this recommendation is to increase the effectiveness of the minimum wage schemes, which are still insufficiently developed in many Member States. In other words, it is essential to enable every citizen to achieve a decent standard of living, especially during the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to remind you that 2010 will be the European Year of the Fight against Poverty and Social Exclusion. It will focus on the following: support for observance of the rights and opportunities for socially excluded people to actively reintegrate themselves into society; emphasis on the responsibility of each member of society in the fight against poverty; broadening the tried and tested methods in the field of social inclusion; strengthening the commitment of the main political actors.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I think the measures I have mentioned testify to the fact that Europe is constantly trying, in a concrete way, to address the needs of the most vulnerable groups, especially in the current economic situation. I hope the Member States will respond positively to the Commission’s call to resolve the social consequences of the crisis. For this purpose, they can make use of the Community instruments available to them, especially the European Social Fund and the European Fund for Adjustment to Globalisation.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive answer. In talking about one of the vulnerable groups, considering the economic situation that we now face and the increase in unemployment levels, obviously one vulnerable group is young people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Very often, in economically difficult times, young people unfortunately get into drug abuse. Is it possible that the European Social Fund could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people, considering the problems that this causes not only to themselves as individuals, but to their families and to their communities, and given the very severe effect it can have on communities, adding to poverty and difficulties?</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Commission strategy, even in this difficult economic situation, is to deal with any discrimination, any breaches of the principle of equal opportunities. Of course, you are well aware that European legislation allows positive action, which means action aimed at groups which are in a very difficult situation. Generally, the Commission, in its proposals before Parliament, is facilitating or – if the proposals are approved – wants to facilitate the use of the European Social Fund and the Globalisation Fund. Essentially, I can say that in terms of regulations, in terms of structure, there are no obstacles to directing a significant proportion of these resources towards young people. This depends on the decisions of individual project sponsors, local communities, and decisions at national level. It is still an open question but, in principle, there are no obstacles to the effective use of resources for the benefit of young people or other groups which are in a particularly difficult situation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the protection of traditional national, ethnic and immigrant minorities in Europe, by Csaba Sándor Tabajdi, Hannes Swoboda, Jan Marinus Wiersma, Véronique De Keyser, Katrin Saks and Claude Moraes, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (O-0002/2009 - B6-0005/2009).</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are more than 300 different national and ethnic minorities and linguistic communities living on the European continent. Of the citizens of the 27 EU Member States, some 15% are members of a traditional national minority or immigrant community. While the objective of the European Union is the preservation of cultural diversity, minority languages and groups face the threat of extinction or assimilation. The steadily growing immigrant communities are dealing with a crisis of integration; think only of the riots in the French suburbs, in the outskirts of Paris, the London terrorist attacks or the ethnic tensions in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Is the European Union credible when it condemns violations of human and minority rights in third countries? Are the EU decision makers adequately addressing the problems of national and ethnic minorities in the potential candidate countries of the Western Balkans, when some Member States are incapable of doing so at home, and in fact their practices are diametrically opposed to this policy? Those who are unable and unwilling to face these questions, who stick their heads in the sand, are playing with the future of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Today’s debate was preceded by voices of concern, with certain people claiming that this issue is too sensitive. Yes, this question is an extremely sensitive one. What would become of the European Union if we were to debate only those questions that do not offend any interests? We cannot sweep these problems under the carpet! The citizens of Europe expect us to provide genuine answers. The European Union must guarantee the rights, at the local, regional, national and EU levels, of indigenous and traditional minorities, the Roma, and the several million people who live in minority status and have no independent State, such as the Catalans, Basques, Scots, Bretons, Alsatians, Corsicans, Welsh, the Hungarian minorities in Romania, Slovakia and Serbia and other national communities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Subsidiarity and self-governance, power sharing and joint decision making are the fundamental values of the European Union. It is very important that forms of joint decision making, self-governance and autonomy be set up on the basis of agreements between majorities and minorities, while fully respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States. As regards persons who belong to immigrant minorities within a State, we must help them integrate as fully as possible, and the immigrant minorities in turn must show the highest possible respect for the language and customs of the State in question. If the European Parliament truly wishes to become a centre of power, then it must face these sensitive questions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tabajdi, respect for minorities is an essential principle among the conditions to be met before a new country can accede to the Union. The Copenhagen criteria are aimed specifically at candidates for accession to the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Respect for the rights of individuals belonging to minorities, including respect for the principle of non-discrimination, is one of the Union’s founding principles. However, the Union does not have general powers in the area of the protection of minority rights. It is up to the national authorities to ensure such protection, in accordance with their constitutional arrangements and their international commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, issues of the institutional organisation or autonomy of minorities fall within the powers of the Member States. Similarly, it is up to each Member State to decide to sign or ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are the two major instruments introduced by the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union has therefore no powers to adopt, as the question suggests, general legislation setting standards for the protection of minorities and inspection mechanisms. The Union may, however, adopt measures on some issues within its powers which have a positive effect on the situation of individuals belonging to minorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For example, the Commission is pursuing a policy to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin or religion. This will ensure the implementation of Community legislation in this area and the implementation of the directive that supplements this legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The adoption of the Framework Decision against Racism and Xenophobia on 28 November is a further example. With this Framework Decision, the Union is contributing to improving the situation of individuals from minorities when they suffer certain types of behaviour. The Union has also acted concerning the situation of the Roma minority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The integration of immigrants is an important and growing issue for the Member States of the European Union. In 2005, the Commission submitted a Common Programme for Integration that forms the framework directive for a common approach to integration in the European Union. In addition, the Union has allocated a budget of EUR 825 million for 2007-2013 to implement the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Three new initiatives from the Commission will appear in 2009: The third edition of the Handbook on Integration, the European Integration Forum, that will further involve civil society in the pursuit of our work, and an integration website that will act as a single portal for information about integration and promote the exchange of best practice among stakeholders in the area of integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The role of the European Union in the area of multilinguism is not to replace the action of Member States but rather to support and supplement such action. The European Commission’s policy on multilinguism includes regional languages as well as the languages spoken by minorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Respect for linguistic and cultural diversity is one of the cornerstones of the European Union. This respect for linguistic and cultural diversity is now part of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states, in Article 22: ‘The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The latest Commission communication, adopted in September 2008, also states that each of the many languages, whether national, regional or spoken by minorities or immigrants, adds something extra to our common culture. The main tools available to the Union in this area are funding programmes, particularly the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights is a very precious tool that we use to collect data useful in the development and implementation of all instruments and these Community policies. Following a request from the European Parliament to the Agency for Fundamental Rights, which I remind you is located in Vienna, the Agency’s 2009 work programme includes the preparation of a comparative report on the situation concerning ethnic and racial discrimination in the European Union. This will allow us to update the report on racism which dealt with the year 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I can tell you. In other words, we do not have a legal basis for organising the protection of minorities. This issue really falls within the powers of the Member States, although the Union must evidently avoid any discrimination towards a citizen who belongs to a minority.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Mr President. Mr Tabajdi has undertaken an enormous task – to try to formulate and classify communities of peoples that have formed in historically different ways who, in greater or lesser numbers, live in states which have at their heart a different ethnic or linguistic origin. As we know, over the centuries in Europe the borders and names of countries have often changed, both as a result of war and when states have joined together or split apart, when empires have formed or collapsed, and very often people, without changing the places where they live, have become subjects of a different king or residents of a different country. Likewise, migration has taken place both at the individual level and with the movement of entire ethnic communities. We have inherited the results of all this. Undoubtedly, today every resident in the European Union deserves a life worthy of a human being and equal opportunities. Just what can we really call a minority though, in today’s sense, and can the states agree and draw up uniform criteria? That is important, for today new migration is taking shape: both internal migration within the European Union and migration from non-EU countries. It seems to me that first of all specialists, researchers, historians, ethnographers and linguists ought to work on this, and then perhaps the politicians can have the last word. If the politicians start things off, then we will instantly see considerable political subjectivity and selfishness, especially as the elections are approaching. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, more than 45 million people belonging to 57 different minorities live in the European Union and in the other European countries. Today, when the ghost of racism is haunting Europe, when the chauvinism of the majority in nation states is visibly growing to frightening dimensions throughout Central and Eastern Europe, we can no longer sweep minority policies under the carpet. As we have heard – from the Commissioner as well – the EU does not yet have a set of regulations on the protection of the identity of minorities that applies to all Member States. The question of minorities falls within the competence of the Member States, and therefore these communities must, for the most part, be satisfied with whatever they can negotiate with their own governments. The total number of citizens in the Central and Eastern European Member States who belong to various national, minority communities is significantly greater than in Western Europe, and their problems are also more complex. In order not only for national minorities but also for everyone belonging to what are effectively minority EU nations to feel truly at home in Europe, European legislation must create a legal framework with comprehensive legal norms for the protection of minorities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We need to create the kind of political structures that do not strive for exclusivity but share areas of competence. As this pattern becomes a reality throughout the European Union, so national minorities will gain in status and obtain new opportunities for the protection of their language and culture. In this regard, the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is of key importance, for two of its articles, thanks to the work of the Hungarian Government, include the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Acceptance of the Treaty would be a great step forward in the history of the European Union. The current economic crisis is not advantageous to minorities, for it poisons conflicts and gives ground to far-right demagoguery. Europe cannot afford, particularly at this moment in time, to fail to listen to the voices of minorities. It cannot abandon minorities at this time of crisis.</p>

      <p sl="sv">A debate at European level on the situation of various minority groups is very welcome. A common view of the rights and obligations that should apply to national, ethnic or linguistic minorities, immigrants and stateless persons would benefit these groups and the whole of the Union in many ways. Nearly a tenth of EU citizens currently belong to a national, linguistic or ethnic minority. Some, like myself, as a Swedish-speaking Finn, are treated well. Others are discriminated against or disavowed. It is important for the historical national minorities to be able to see themselves as full members of the Union. The EU needs the support of its minorities and must not neglect to give them the opportunity to participate actively in decision making and the work of ensuring a safe and harmonious common future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is clear that the same rules cannot apply to national minorities as apply, for example, to immigrant minorities. Immigrants require special support to help them integrate into their new homelands. Stateless people are a separate issue and should be encouraged, using all means available, to apply for citizenship in their host country.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The EU also needs a common view on minority issues in order to be able to defend itself and its Member States against outside pressures and provocations, where minority rights are used as weapons to sow division and create confusion. Russia’s involvement and propaganda in Estonia and Latvia, for example, is a cautionary example. We must not put weapons in the hands of those who want to harm us.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Europe needs a representative minority forum that would act as an advisory body on issues dealt with by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe. It would also be important for this parliamentary committee to be given explicit responsibility for issues relating to minorities. This Parliament should approve a statement on the rights of minorities.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like to ask a specific question: is the Commission prepared to take responsibility for initiating a European debate on minorities and is it prepared to actively promote the fair treatment of the Union’s minorities and not simply linguistic diversity, which is often used as a way of ignoring the minority groups.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, some minority groups have been present in the Member States for centuries, whilst others are relatively recent arrivals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Roma are one of the traditional minority groups that have been present in Union countries essentially as long as records exist. I am sorry to say that in my country, Poland, although the Roma are not discriminated against, the extent of their integration leaves much to be desired. They share this view. I believe that the Roma need more support from the state. In particular, they need assistance with vocational training and with education in general.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Member States should play the leading role regarding the integration of this and other minority groups.

      <p sl="es">This resolution is necessary because it is clear that we have to find a minimum level of protection for minority groups in the European Union, something that does not exist at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not share Commissioner Barrot’s perception, in often hiding behind the European Union’s lack of jurisdiction on this matter. It is a patent contradiction to mention the Copenhagen criteria, to mention another type of legislation and, at the same time, – when, perhaps, it is not of interest or when, perhaps, one is not brave enough – to hide behind the lack of jurisdiction in order not to, shall we say, make progress in the protection of minority groups, because we are, ultimately, facing an eternal dilemma.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in every Member State of the EU there are groupings of people who are seen as different because of characteristics like ethnicity, language, how they dress, the music they play and how they worship. When the people in that country are committed to respect for the innate dignity of every human person, these differences are seen as enriching, and people are valued. In fact, when the dignity of the human person is valued, we do not view minorities in a negative way at all. However, in many countries, this respect is weak or non-existent. This leads to discrimination in which minorities are abused and relegated to the poorest of circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="de">We insist in the Copenhagen Agreement that a country wishing to join the EU must have at least a minimally acceptable level of respect for everyone within its borders. This principle falls down when we ignore these criteria and allow membership to countries where people are being marginalised and mistreated.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Ireland, for instance, many children and adults with disabilities were institutionalised in the worst of circumstances at the time of our accession and for years after our membership.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, in spite of the introduction of the Copenhagen criteria, there exist similar terrible circumstances for vulnerable minorities in countries which have recently joined the EU or which plan to. The Copenhagen criteria were clearly ignored in those cases, and the treatment of minorities was not considered an obstacle to membership. This negates the purpose of the agreement. If a country, in order to join the EU, must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria in respect of the treatment of its people, it should be possible to suspend membership when it does not.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We are dealing with the problem of ethnic minorities, but this means primarily the Hungarian ethnic minority, Mr Tabajdi. Hungary is indeed where ethnic minorities have been almost completely eliminated over the past decades. The words of the former ombudsman for minorities in Hungary, Jenö Kaltenbacha, confirm this. The number of Slovaks living in Hungary has fallen from more than 300 000 to 18 000 during the time in question. For the decimated Slovak minority, Hungarian is used exclusively as the language of instruction in the ethnic minority schools in Hungary. In those schools, Slovak is taught for four hours a week.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There is no vendetta under way in Slovakia, and for the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia, things are incomparably better. In the Hungarian minority schools, the language of instruction is exclusively Hungarian. Slovak is taught as a supplementary language for a few hours each week. Religious services are conducted only in Hungarian in all Slovak communities in Hungary, and they are conducted exclusively by Hungarian priests. On the other hand, only Hungarian priests officiate in Hungarian communities in Slovakia.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Parliament, however, is paradoxically not devoting any attention to the problems of the Slovak, German, Serbian and other beleaguered minorities in Hungary. There is repeated discussion of the peripheral problems of the Hungarian minority, which the Slovak government is, in any case, currently considering. Only today, as part of this process, it approved an amendment to the education act, guaranteeing that geographical names will be printed in Hungarian or Ukrainian in textbooks for minority schools. It is the Hungarian politicians and MPs who, under the guise of settling ethnic problems, are constantly foisting their ideas about autonomous solutions, including territorial autonomy. Most recently, the Hungarian President did so during a visit by his Romanian counterpart to Budapest, and met with a stern rejection. Such attitudes need to be unmasked and vigorously condemned within the European Parliament as well.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Whereas the interests of any other social minorities protected by anti-discrimination regulations are vigorously defended, European legal protection, not to mention political will, is reticent where traditional national minorities are concerned. Yet the existence of these minorities within the European Union is not a political question but a matter of fact – there are millions living within the EU who are not immigrants. They live within European Member States while never having moved from their ancestral lands. It was just that in the course of events in the twentieth century, the boundaries of their countries have shifted around them, leaving them behind ever since facing insoluble dilemmas. How are they to preserve their identity and community, how can they provide their children with a secure image of a twenty-first century future? We must at last admit that the problems of these communities cannot be resolved purely by means of universal human rights or anti-discrimination regulations. These communities rightfully demand all those things that, in the case of similar-sized populations, the European Union deems to be the right of those who are part of a majority. This is why EU regulation is necessary and why the assistance of the EU is necessary. Such communities are right in thinking, for instance, that autonomy, which has brought prosperity and development to the minorities of the South Tyrol in Italy, would also bring them a desirable solution.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Certainly, forms of autonomy – including perhaps territorial autonomy – could give a positive and manageable future to such communities. There should be no mystification surrounding such communities, but they should be discussed openly, since if such an option can be a positive solution in one Member State without harming the State’s territorial integrity, it could similarly prove to be a solution in other Member States as well. The rightful demands of these minorities, which are based on fundamental principles and current practice in the European Union, cannot constitute taboo subjects in the EU in the twenty-first century!</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it is curious that in every parliamentary term, we have pointed out the non-existent or fragile legal and material protection of one or another minority group within Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">With the recent enlargement towards the east, the situation has, unavoidably, become far more complex.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Europe of 27 has more than 100 groups, if we add its ethnic and linguistic minorities to those resulting from more recent immigration. Particular mention should be – and already has been – made of the Roma, an ethnic group that has lived among us for centuries. It has its own characteristics and suffers the greatest disadvantages of all minority groups of any kind.</p>
      <p sl="es">Doubling our efforts to achieve gradual integration, if not assimilation, of these groups and making this unity in diversity a reality is a major challenge for Europe, Commissioner. It is not for nothing that the Treaty of Lisbon makes explicit reference, for the first time in European Union history, to the rights of people belonging to those minorities and to their own values.</p>
      <p sl="es">Each social group is different. Member States’ linguistic-historical minorities and their recognised and indisputable right to express themselves in their mother tongues have little or nothing to do with the new migration flows, which have their own identifying characteristics.</p>

      <p sl="es">I shall end on this note: we have an obligation in our Member States to protect and preserve the traditions and values of the multicultural Europe that is emerging, and the duty of this Parliament is to establish integration standards within a common European framework that facilitates peaceful coexistence.</p>

They look to the European Union to guarantee their rights and help improve their situation. In terms of human rights, the European Union’s greatest debt is in relation to the protection of minorities. Although the legal grounds for effective protection of minorities exist, the political will to assert these is often insufficient. Ratification of the Lisbon Treaty could improve the situation, but in itself, it is no magic solution. It is important for existing institutions to work effectively and, in particular, for the minority profile of the Fundamental Rights Agency to be strengthened. The various minorities would consider it a positive sign if the new Commission had a commissioner whose responsibility was exclusively to deal with minority affairs. This would give a clear signal that the minorities are also full citizens of a unifying Europe. Europe cannot have stepchildren, since in one sense or another, all of us are minorities.</p>

I find it painful that in the absence of the necessary support from the political groups, our joint debate today is coming to an end without a decision, and that it is still not possible to adopt the EU framework agreement on minority protection. In the countries of the former Communist camp, the principle of non-intervention was supreme. I consider it unacceptable that the European Union is similarly leaving the solution of the problem of minorities within the area of competence of individual Member States. I consider President Traian Băsescu’s declarations in Budapest rejecting the rightful demands of Transylvanian Hungarians for collective rights and autonomy to be reminiscent of the dictatorial standpoint during the National Communist era. The European Union is the joint home of national, ethnic and religious minorities as well, and precisely for this reason, the EU can no longer put off providing them with institutional, legally regulated protection.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For non-national minorities, and I am only talking about them, the community approach has to be rejected because it will inevitably destroy the coherence of many European nations. Where there is rule of law, regulation of the way in which people live together must remain a national power. In this matter, if the majority were the enemy of the minority, then this would seriously call democracy into question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with poverty or danger, some people flee their country of origin to seek refuge. The right to asylum is a way for people to vote with their feet.

In this instance, the duty is to accept the rules, languages and customs of the receiving countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The right of asylum is a precious right as it is a right inherent to the human being. Even if you belong to a minority, this does not legitimise the creation of a community right. Your ultimate allegiance must always be to the country in which you settle.

Over time, this will only create either a field of indifference or a field for a battle.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I do not think that it is helpful either to divide minorities into different categories as this may give the idea that these categories must be treated in different ways. All citizens must be treated equally and enjoy the same rights and obligations towards the communities among which they live. Decentralisation and local autonomy under national laws very much reflect all the aspirations that citizens have, whatever their nationality or ethnic background. It is not normal to raise for discussion concepts which are not yet enshrined in current international law and which are not accepted at Member State level. We do not need either to adopt the provisions of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A specific mention must be made about the Roma minority. I firmly believe that common EU programmes, especially in the area of education, would accelerate considerably the integration of the Roma.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to remind you that any nation, no matter how big it might be, is a minority compared to Europe’s 500 million citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The protection of minorities is indisputably one of the most important principles, and in my country, the Slovak Republic, a really exceptionally high standard of protection is guaranteed for minorities. If we are going to talk about ethnic minorities, one can say that this standard is also guaranteed in the form of cultural and educational autonomy, because we have a university for our largest ethnic minority</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, I fundamentally oppose opening a discussion on territorial autonomy, because I consider it to be a very important political and legal issue, and also because I consider it to be, in humanistic terms, quite heartrending.. It could cause enormous human unhappiness. The opening of discussions on territorial autonomy would also fundamentally threaten the unity and successful progress of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">To conclude, Commissioner, since you have spoken of respect – yes, it is entirely appropriate that the majority society should harbour the greatest respect for its minorities, but I think the minorities in a healthily functioning society should have equal respect for that society.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Tabajdi for his excellent work. It is regrettable that we are not able to conclude our debates with a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am firmly convinced that minority rights must become a part of the acquis communautaire . Unfortunately, the Commission is very reluctant to suggest any measures in this field. We should remember that minority rights are an integral part of human rights and therefore our standards must be as high as possible. Let us not forget that respect for, and protection of, minorities is one of the Copenhagen criteria. The Commission does not even apply the criteria properly during the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are ready to make concessions hoping that the situation will improve afterwards, but since the accessions, there are still no tools to address the issue, as Commissioner Barrot pointed out last month. We have elaborated a common European Union standard in the field of minority rights, and this is an absolute must.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President. There are few political territories within the European Union where a double standard is in effect. The Copenhagen criteria on minority rights apply to accession countries – as we have already heard today – but these same rights do not exist within Community law. If Europe’s wealth lies in its diverse cultures, and no one wants to see the culture and language of small nations disappear, then ethnic minorities have an even greater need of protection, including legal protection. In the new Member States, the apparent protection afforded by socialist internationalism has disappeared, and national sentiments have intensified. In addition, various forms of oppressive nationalism often appear in the new Member States, especially since even the Copenhagen criteria are no longer binding. We often witnesses the strengthening of assimilationist efforts – allegedly in the minority’s own interest. Unfortunately, this is a political tool often used by populist parties to turn the majority against the minority.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The establishment of internal legal standards to protect the legal status of minorities is unavoidable. These standards must follow European best practices, building on the various forms of self-governance that do not need to be unmasked as some sort of political crime, or rejected. Rather, the principle of subsidiarity should be extended to allow minorities to make decisions with regard to their own affairs. Perhaps the method of open coordination may be helpful in this regard, until a legal basis is created. I would put the following question to the Commissioner: would it not be possible to use this option, this method, for providing a solution to the legal status of minorities? Finally, I would like to thank Mr Tabajdi for his excellent work in this area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We have, at European level, a coherent set of regulations, criteria and recommendations which guarantee protection for citizens belonging to national minorities and instances of their infringement are fairly rare within the European Union. Romania has allowed its minorities to enjoy national rights which extend beyond relevant European standards. Indeed, the presence in this Chamber of Romanian MEPs who are ethnic Hungarians is living proof of this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital for interethnic harmony in Europe that human rights are respected, but any separatist exploits triggered by the deterioration in ethnic rights must be halted. The European project is about integration and not about creating enclaves based on ethnic criteria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also feel that we should focus more attention on the situation of national minorities in the EU’s neighbouring countries, all the more so when it involves citizens of the same nationality of some of the Member States. One example of this is the Romanians in Ukraine, Serbia and the Republic of Moldova, who are deprived of basic rights and are subject to an intensive process of denationalisation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in the EU there are several cases of languages spoken by historical European groups which cannot be used in debates in this Parliament since they are not recognised as state languages. This is a loss to representative democracy.</p>
      <p sl="es">One of these cases is the Basque language, Euskera, which is not a minority language but an official one, at least in the southern area of the Basque Country, which, in administrative terms, is classed as part of the Spanish state. However, the same is not true – and please do not take this personally, Commissioner – in the northern part of the Basque Country, which is attached to the French state, whose President stated to the United Nations Assembly that to deny respect for national identities and languages is to sow the seeds of humiliation and that, without that respect, there will not be peace in the world. For all that, neither Euskera nor Corsican, Breton or Occitan are given the slightest official consideration, nor are they given support to ensure their use is respected and encouraged.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why I ask the Agency for Fundamental Rights to keep watch and to work to ensure that within Member States, there is no violation of any European people’s right to use its mother tongue and no discrimination against its citizens, and that all native languages are considered official within their respective territories.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this debate, the more so as European history shows that in times of crisis, ethnic tensions can inflame otherwise stable situations. I would like to believe that the intent of the initiators of this debate is to emphasise the generous core values and realities of the European project, because the realities of the European Union are indeed the best standards in the world for the treatment of minorities. Therefore, we should say out loud that this Assembly does not, and will not, accept any divisive actions or the lowering of the standards I have just mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Commissioner Barrot has underlined, in each individual country of the Union, there is a clear and, more often than not, official legal framework that ensures the protection of our cultural diversity. Yet, for the sustainability of our multi-ethnic society, is there any alternative to higher education? Real-life examples show that solving issues related to education fuels strong Community development. Education is, by its own nature, unifying rather than divisive. In fact, it teaches us that we are all someone else’s minority. The Babeş-Bolyai University in Romania, in the Transylvanian city of Cluj, is an example of a multicultural university that has been cited time and again by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as a positive example of multicultural and inter-ethnic excellence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where the need arises, higher-degree education in the language of minorities is part of the national educational system. Let me give you the example of Sapientia University in Romania.</p>
      <p sl="en">These positive examples, however, do not mean that we can take our eye off the ball, and we must be aware that maybe the most challenging issue lies ahead of us: solving the difficult situation of the Roma community throughout Europe. It is my belief that the most effective way of solving this tremendously difficult European problem in the long term is through education. I would very much like to see a very substantial debate on how Europe intends to take advantage of our unique educational system so that we remain united in our diversity.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Council of Europe is the institution which deals with respect for human rights. The rights and protection of minorities come under the remit of Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Traditional and ethnic minorities, migrant minorities and immigrants must comply with the national legislation of the Member State where they reside.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the integration of new migrant minorities should not be part of the common policy on immigration which the EU is currently drafting. This policy can be defined only when the current barriers to the free movement of workers from the Member States which joined the European Union after 2004 disappear within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The protection of migrant minorities is part of the principles promoted by social Europe. Providing fair working conditions for all European citizens, no matter what their Member State of origin is, guarantees them a decent living. As a European socialist, I support the development of a European framework for legal immigration, but I actively advocate, first and foremost, observance of the European Union’s basic principles for all European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Unfortunately, today this draft decision is being put to the Parliament only in the form of a question. Representatives of traditional national minorities and communities have been trying to persuade the majority through peaceful parliamentary means that what was good for the 14 Member States of the European Union will be good for the entire territory of the EU. The traditional national minorities found themselves in a new country through no fault of their own, without ever having moved from their centuries-old homelands. No one asked them whether they wanted to change nationalities or adopt a new official language. These traditional national minorities are the most loyal citizens of their respective countries. Despite wars, economic crises, internal political battles and assimilation, they did not abandon their ancestral, longstanding and yet new homeland. Their loyalty has been unbroken. It is precisely for this reason that it is incomprehensible that the several dozen million strong populations of large countries should fear a few hundred thousand or, at most, half a million members of a minority.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The various forms of self-governance found in the European Union, such as territorial and cultural autonomy, result from a policy of consensus on the part of the majority and minority, and have not weakened the economic, political or social power of the state in question, or that of the European Union. My country, Romania, has been in existence in its current form since 1920. In 1930, the population on this territory included 28% non-Romanians; today, this has fallen to 10%. There are several other Member States besides Romania that have similar concerns. There are laws and rights, but their implementation cannot be guaranteed, although linguistic, ethnic and regional diversity is a European value. Therefore, it is important for draft guidelines to be drawn up, based on existing, successful EU examples, that are acceptable to all and do not infringe on the states’ territorial integrity.</p>

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my pleasure at welcoming Csaba Tabajdi’s initiative intended to improve the situation of minorities living in the European Union. Although eminent examples prove that national minorities are regarded as a value and an opportunity in the European Union, such as in South Tyrol or the Åland Islands, unfortunately, in Eastern Europe, we come across the opposite attitude as well, sometimes even in presentations by statesmen. It is precisely for this reason that we urgently need to oppose declarations that would definitively and perpetually rule out the demands of national minorities for autonomy, by referring to the requirements set by the European Union. We therefore need to speak with determination and declare that national minorities are entitled to autonomy as an exercise of minority rights at Community level, and that we must guarantee these fundamental rights, as well, through the legal system of the European Union. I therefore fully support the elaboration of a comprehensive regulation for the protection of minority rights at European level. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is a very happy occasion and the credit for it, with my thanks, goes in particular to Mr Tabajdi, Chairman of the Intergroup and champion of minorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today I am using the Italian language, which is the language of the State and not my mother tongue. I do this for a specific reason: a large number of ethnic minorities from various countries and ethnic groups live in Italy. Today, I want to use this demonstration – as well as the demonstration that an ethnic minority is not an ethnic minority merely for itself but has to experience solidarity – to give to these minorities a voice here in this House. I also want to tell the Italian minorities who live abroad that they would otherwise not have this possibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Barrot spoke today about non-discrimination. I believe that non-discrimination is not enough, because we must achieve equal rights and equal rights will come only when we have minority situations and give them considerable help in reaching a level equal to that of the majority. For this reason, we need positive discrimination in certain situations. This, I believe, is a new idea, an idea that needs to be pursued.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union has competencies. By making use of Articles 21 and 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon – let us hope that these enter into force as soon as possible – together with the Copenhagen criteria, and a small amount of flexibility and legislative imagination, we would be able to achieve a great many things. I want to mention, in particular, Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the protection of the rights of individuals – and here, particular thanks go to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Frattini, who made a decisive contribution to its inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="it">We hope for protection of rights for groups: that is our goal. Since there are 168 minority groups in the European Union and about 330 on the continent of Europe, 100 million of our fellow citizens on this continent are experiencing this situation. We in South Tyrol have reached a level that can obviously be improved on, but which is very, very good nonetheless. When I hear from representatives in this House or Members from majority populations that their minorities are well treated, I am somewhat mistrustful. I would be happier if the representatives of these minorities said that they were well treated.</p>
      <p sl="it">We in the European Union need to understand that minorities represent added value, a bridge between cultures, between peoples and countries. We must work towards unity in cultural diversity.</p>

In such cases, it is indeed an immense challenge for a single country.</p>
      <p sl="et">At European Union level, however, it is very important that double standards not be applied. The Copenhagen criteria, which the previous speakers have already mentioned in several speeches, and which the new acceding states were required to meet, have already been discussed, but we were also very well aware that those same criteria, those same requirements – for instance educational requirements – are not met in many of the old Member States. It is crucial that all countries be treated in the same manner, and that minimal standards apply to all.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Romania perhaps has the most generous and up-to-date legislation on national minorities in Europe. They enjoy extensive political and social rights, identical to those enjoyed by all citizens. Minorities of significant size, such as the Hungarians, enjoy the right to education in their mother tongue at every level. Representatives of the minorities are entitled to seats in parliament, even if they have not obtained the necessary votes. In fact, the Hungarian minority party, which has been referred to this evening and during yesterday evening’s debates, has formed part of the Romanian Government for 12 of the 19 years since Romania has been operating as a democratic state.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the progress which my fellow Members have made, as well as their constant concern for the protection of ethnic, traditional or national minorities. This is an obvious and welcome approach. However, in terms of relations between the majority and minority, I would like to advise you of two aspects: 1) I feel that not only members of a minority should be involved in measures of this kind, but majorities must also deal with issues relating to minorities, to the same extent, precisely in order to support and protect what we call ‘unity in diversity’, which is taking place in Romania. 2) I appreciate that minorities should equally be concerned about the status of the majorities as these two entities form, but only together, this unitary whole which contributes to the natural development of any society.</p>

      <p sl="fr">During this debate, many Members and colleagues have spoken of double standards, of unequal obligations on the old and new Member States. What measures are you taking in respect of the old Members, in other words the 15 Member States who do not comply with the Copenhagen Agreement?</p>

    <intervention id="2-467" speaker_id="23808" name="Csaba Sándor Tabajdi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, the first question that must be answered is whether or not the issue of national minorities falls exclusively within national powers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think not, because if the issue of human rights is not an internal issue for the Member States of the European Union, then neither is the issue of the rights of national minorities. This, of course, requires clarification. Yugoslavia was bombed because the rights of Kosovars were infringed, so why do we not make ourselves clear on this issue?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, why, prior to accession, was the situation in the new Member States better than it is at present?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, Mr Beazley raised the question of double standards. It is true that, despite the problems, the situation of the Hungarian community in Romania is better. There are problems in Romania, but the situation is better than in Alsace or Brittany. Why are there double standards?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly, let us talk about territorial autonomy. In the Åland Islands of Finland and in South Tyrol in Italy, regional autonomy has really stabilised the country. In Spain, the system of autonomous regions is a very good example, despite a few Basque extremists who deserve our condemnation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Mr President, it has to be said that non-discrimination and equal treatment are insufficient to compensate for the disadvantages of minorities. At the end of the day, satisfied minorities are factors for stability in the countries of Europe. As Henrik Lax always says, ‘if a policy is carried out properly, it will always pay dividends’. That is the reality and I would like to thank you for the debate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have listened very carefully to everybody’s contributions, and I am touched by the passion that underlies some of these positions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Tabajdi has just listed a whole raft of problems. I am well aware that these problems do exist, but I must once again – regretfully, but there is nothing else I can do – remind you that the protection of groups, of national minorities as groups, does not fall within the EU’s sphere of competence, nor even within that of the Agency for Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, at my urging, the Agency will look into ethnic and racial discrimination when it updates its 2007 report on racism, but I would reiterate that the treaties grant no jurisdiction in this field: not to the European Union, not to the Commission and not to the Agency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The open method of coordination has been mentioned, but this method too requires us to have competence. It is quite clear that, were the Council to alter its position, that might open up other paths but, for the time being, we ourselves are paying special attention to the fight against the discrimination that can particularly affect people from minorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to make things quite clear here: we do have the tools, at Community level, to combat discrimination. Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community has formed the legal basis for two directives: the Directive of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, and the Directive of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From that point of view, therefore, there is indeed a will to combat all forms of discrimination against citizens from minority groups. On top of that, the Agency for Fundamental Rights is going, at my request, to undertake a very in-depth study into all of these forms of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is as much as I am able to say. I cannot go any further, because we do not have the legal tools. The Member States will not allow us to.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, the position of Roma in the European Union, for example, is indeed deplorable, and their integration is a top priority for both the Union and the Commission, as was reiterated at the first European Roma Summit on 16 September, in which I took part along with Mr Barroso and Mr Špidla. In the wake of this summit, Mr Špidla is going to establish a European platform on the Roma. This flexible structure will allow us to rise to the challenges at EU level. Nevertheless, we do also need to be careful, as, in the Commission’s opinion, an ethnic approach would be counterproductive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to conclude by saying that I have been touched by what has been said here. It is quite clear that the real strength of the European Union lies in resolving this problem of conflict between minorities and majorities in a given state, but it is also true that the European Union is currently a federation of national states, which means that it is difficult for us to go any further.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That said, there is nothing to stop countries informally exchanging good practices or best practices. You have referred to the very good practices in certain of the newer Member States of the Union, and I do not doubt that such good practices can be taken as an inspiration for other similar examples.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, Mr President, is what I have to say, and I regret that I cannot give you a better response, but I am, after all, obliged to toe the line of what the European Union actually is as it stands. Even so, I would stress once again that, in the event of discrimination against individuals belonging to a minority group, you can be sure that I will stand absolutely firm, because I have every intention of ensuring respect for this non-discrimination which, I hope, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will institutionalise very strongly following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="pl">No country in contemporary Europe denies the rights of minorities. Under the EU’s motto ‘United in Diversity’ , we are building a multicultural Europe, a Europe in which national minorities coexist with large monolithic states and enjoy their full political rights and citizens’ rights. It appears that Europe is of one mind on this. Nowadays, anyone who queries the rights of minorities will certainly not succeed in the world of politics. The rights of minorities are enshrined in the legal order of individual EU Member States, and also confirmed by many international agreements.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I was therefore amazed by the ruling handed down by the Supreme Administrative Court in Lithuania on 30 January of this year. According to the ruling, placing signs bearing street names in Polish alongside others bearing street names in Lithuanian contravened the law. The authorities in the Vilnius region were ordered to remove the signs in the Polish language within a month. The issue is particularly curious because ethnic Poles account for as much as 70% of the population in the Vilnius region, and street signs in Polish are to be found almost everywhere. This has happened despite the fact that Lithuania has committed itself to the European Charter for Local Self-Government and has ratified the 1995 European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Article 11 of the latter provides for the use of minority languages, including on street signs. It is hard to understand why Lithuania, which has now been a Member State of the EU for five years, is disregarding Union standards and failing to guarantee the rights of minorities on its territory.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The rights of national minorities in EU Member States constitute an important issue in terms of human rights. In practice, however, the issue is often exploited in actions aimed at spreading revisionism across Europe and calling borders into question.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The right to use one’s native language and the right to preserve one’s traditional culture and customs are undoubtedly two of the rights that must be protected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In recent times, there have been frequent cases in Europe when certain minorities have expressed the wish to have specific territories returned to the country with which they have a national allegiance. This provokes a reaction by the majority. There have also been cases when minorities numbering several million persons have been ignored and have been refused the status of a minority. This has happened, for example, to Poles in Germany. Germany is thereby violating the fundamental rights of minorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The case of people who have arrived in our countries from outside Europe is quite different. Clearly, these individuals have the right to their own culture and language. They may not, however, create their own special areas to which they transfer the law of their countries of origin.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, there is a Member State of the European Union that uses the concept of ‘non-citizens’ to designate hundreds of thousands of people living in that country. The vast majority were born in that country, work in that country but nevertheless are given the epithet ‘non-citizens’. This is an aberration in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an aberration because the European Union is based on the concept of non-discrimination, on the principle of equality, which today is being negated in that country: it is failing to recognise those people’s rights and is subjecting a group to historical discrimination purely on account of its ethnic origin. This is not acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have examined specific cases in the Committee on Petitions. The first case was that of a man who came and said ‘the first time I was able to vote was when I was studying in Germany. I was able to vote in German local elections, but in my own country I have not been able to vote because they do not recognise me. I do not have another passport. I do not have another country. I only have this country and I cannot vote.’ That is an aberration.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have dealt with another case in the Committee on Petitions concerning a man who has passed the language examinations in Latvia, who knows all the laws and who, nonetheless, is not granted citizenship because the state considers that – and I repeat what the Ambassador said to us – ‘this man is not loyal to the state’. How is that possible? How is it possible that this situation affects 20-25% of the population of a member country of the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="es">We ask that people’s fundamental rights be respected and that everyone be made aware of the situation, given that some countries have joined the European Union without fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria. We also ask that pressure be exerted on the Commission since, up to now, the European Commission has only shown weakness and a total lack of interest or concern.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is sad to observe that today, almost five years after enlargement, there is little evidence of Latvia having demonstrated respect for its largest minority. The recommendations of the European Parliament and numerous other institutional organisations have been completely ignored.</p>
      <p sl="en">A large part of Latvia’s population has been alienated from the state and its institutions. No wonder the naturalisation rate is slow. Turning people into aliens and issuing them with an alien passport does not inspire in them feelings of being associated with the state. They do not participate. They do not take decisions. They do not vote, not even in those cities where they represent up to 40% of the population and where political decisions directly affect their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is this situation good or bad for the European Union? This is a question for the Commission and Council. Democracy cannot flourish without civil society, and there is no civil society without participation. Participation begins at local community level.</p>
      <p sl="en">These people were born in the country or have spent most of their lives there, and we are talking about more than 15% of Latvia’s population, or some 372 000 people. The EU must take action on their behalf. Why does the Commission not act on this? Citizens of other EU Member States residing in Latvia may vote and stand in municipal and European Parliament elections, but hundreds of thousands of people who were born in the country or have spent most of their lives there do not enjoy this right.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what they have done in order to address this issue with the Latvian authorities, and to take further action without any delay.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, my Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, did not hesitate to submit this oral question to the Commission when, during several sessions in the Committee on Petitions, we became aware of the situation in which many citizens of Latvia find themselves.</p>
      <p sl="es">Members of the Commission, Commissioner, it is unacceptable that we are seeing cases of segregated citizens in the European Union in the 21st century. This does not conform to the European Union, its principles or its values. In a state that has been part of the European Union since 2004, with a population of barely 2.5 million inhabitants, there is currently a law in force preventing half a million people, quite simply, from exercising their rights as citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">These people are called non-citizens. They have a black-coloured passport and for that reason, they are called ‘blacks’ or ‘aubergines’. They are even referred to as such by the administration itself, by the State, the government, and they are citizens who do not enjoy their legitimate right to be able to vote or be elected.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe, therefore, that the European Commission should exert considerable pressure on the government in order to prevent its failure to observe many recommendations that have been made by various institutions, such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Council of Europe Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and the very recommendation made by this Parliament in the debate on Latvia’s accession, the Resolution of 11 March, in which it was clearly stated that a real solution had to be found to the segregation problem and the issue of those citizens who are required to prove whether they were born before 1940. This is, quite simply, unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not believe it should be tolerated. We cannot coexist in the European Union while this situation continues and, therefore, we believe it is very important that the Commission, the European Union authorities and all of us put forward proposals in the same vein to put an end to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">To that effect, our group expects the Commission to make concrete proposals on the questions that we raise in this debate. With regard to language, we are also concerned by the fact that, pursuant to new regulations − and there were student demonstrations last year − 60% of the curriculum must be taught in Latvian, thereby creating clear discrimination against the Russian language.</p>
      <p sl="es">I seem to recall that during the Franco dictatorship in my home country of Spain, it was forbidden to speak in Basque, Catalan or Galician. Those languages were simply banned. Today, the reality is that they are co-official. I believe that this is a situation that should also be put in force so that, ultimately, no citizens of the European Union are prevented from expressing themselves in their mother tongue, in their own language, which should share equal official status with any other language that can be used in that state.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore call on the Commission to act dynamically once and for all so as to prevent the segregation that is taking place in that member country of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the example of Spain was just raised, but it is, in fact, the Spanish State that has actually dealt with the problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is aware of the specific circumstances in which the Russian-speaking minority in Latvia find themselves. A great deal of effort was made as part of the pre-accession strategy to promote the naturalisation and integration of these people, in line with the recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has repeatedly emphasised that all the parties involved, including the minority themselves, need to contribute to this complex process and to come up with solutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the specific issue of the participation of non-Latvian citizens in local elections, all that the Treaty establishing the European Community guarantees, in terms of electoral rights, is the participation of EU citizens in European and municipal elections in their Member State of residence, even if they are not nationals of that state.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The participation in elections of people who are not nationals of an EU country, and are therefore not EU citizens, is not an issue covered by Community law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission therefore cannot talk to Latvia regarding the issue of these people’s participation in local elections. It is up to the Member States to decide such issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do understand the situation depicted by the co-authors of the oral question, but unfortunately, I cannot give them any other answer, so we need to leave it to Latvia itself to take care of this problem, which the Union is not in a legal position to resolve.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Mr President, I must remind you that in my small country, Latvia, there are 2.3 million inhabitants, of whom approximately 1.6 million are of Latvian ethnic origin. Nonetheless, in Latvia, primary education is dispensed by the state and local government in eight minority languages, some of which, such as Romany and Estonian, are very small. When speaking about Russian-speaking non-citizens, one cannot use the concept of a ‘traditional minority’. In the sense of Western European countries, they could be said to be newcomers or immigrants who, at the time of the Soviet occupation, arrived in Latvia and enjoyed many privileges. Firstly, they had the privilege of not learning the language of the land and people they had come to, but of speaking only Russian. My country has enacted one of the most generous naturalisation laws in Europe, precisely in order to meet those people halfway. Over the ten-year period that this law has been in force, approximately 50% of non-citizens have acquired citizenship rights. When a survey was conducted recently, however, in late 2008, among people who had not become naturalised, 74% did not wish to obtain Latvian citizenship. Secondly, only one third of non-citizens has made use of the right to register as Latvian citizens children born after Latvia regained its independence – just one third. Why that is, I do not know. Mrs Ždanoka, who was elected from Latvia and represents Latvian citizens of Russian origin, makes no secret of the fact that after obtaining voting rights for non-citizens, the next step would be to call for Russian to be given the status of a second state or official language. What does that mean? Firstly, it means the retention of privileged status for people who came to Latvia from Russia, and secondly, it would be the signing of a [death] sentence for the Latvian language and culture since, behind the Russian speakers, there are 140 million more in Russia, with increasing nationalistic ambitions. For the Latvian language, it is not possible, as small as we are, as few in number as we are. Finally, we joined the European Union not in order to retain the divided society created by the Soviet occupation, but in order to overcome it and to retain our own identity. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner Barrot’s response was very disappointing. I would have expected a more positive response from him, despite the legal constraints that he operates under. I thought he might have said that he would do what he could to encourage change in Latvia in the spirit of the European Union’s principle of diversity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am from Ireland; I speak English. English is my mother tongue, but I am not English: I am Irish. The reality is that the European Union is made up of many states. Virtually all our states have minorities and majorities who have histories relating to being part of an empire or to being an empire or a colony. We have had to deal with that.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I moved to Latvia and lived and worked there for a while, I would be able to vote in local elections. However, there are hundreds of thousands of people in Latvia who were born in Latvia but who cannot vote in local elections. That is an injustice, but – I would tell Mr Pīks – it is also self-destructive because, in order to overcome the difficulties and the fears, we must make all of our people welcome in our states. We must encourage them to participate politically. Enabling people to vote in local elections would enable them to feel part of their community and part of the management of their own local communities and would help, as I say, to overcome barriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the largest migrant communities in Ireland is British. They can all vote in local elections in Ireland. They cannot all vote in national elections because they do not all hold Irish citizenship, but they all vote in Irish local elections and make a very important contribution to Irish political life. So I would appeal to those in this House who are from Latvia – and indeed from any other of our Member States that have minority, or even majority, problems – to bear in mind that, in order to overcome these difficulties and to overcome fear, we have to make people welcome and incorporate them into our political process, not keep them out of it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all it must be remembered that after 1945, as the British, French, Belgians and Dutch streamed out of their colonies, the Russians started to stream into them. Also in 1949, when the Geneva Convention prohibited settling civilians in occupied territories, the Russification of Latvia was intensified, and a flow of two million immigrants was organised by the Soviet authorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">It can therefore be said that, when the Republic of Latvia regained its independence in 1991, the Soviet-era newcomers were in Latvia illegally. So the Russians today are being granted citizenship via naturalisation as a humanitarian act by the Latvian Government, and not as a right.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to the Charter of the United Nations, normally citizenship laws belong to a country’s internal affairs and no other countries can meddle with them, not even the UN itself. Therefore, the position of the Latvian authorities with regard to the possibility of granting voting rights to non-citizens is firm and unchanged: the right to vote is an integral part of citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such a position is also in line with international law and practice. At the same time, Latvia, with considerable financial help from other countries – with the exception of Russia – has made significant efforts to facilitate the naturalisation process and integration of non-citizens in Latvia, bringing the percentage of non-citizens down to 16% at the end of 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our aim is to ensure that all inhabitants of Latvia can apply for citizenship and enjoy their rights fully and effectively. Latvia aims to have citizens with full rights, instead of having non-citizens with many rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I understand that this position of Latvia contradicts the policy published in the Russian Diplomatic Herald by Mr Karaganov in 1992, as well as his supporters here in the European Parliament, but we will never give up protecting our country against these disinformation campaigns.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Latvia’s liberal law has allowed anyone to testify to their loyalty to the Latvian state and Western democratic values. As a result, since 1993, the number of non-citizens has fallen by 59%. The majority of Latvia’s businesses belong to Russian entrepreneurs. These are arguments that permit us to reject the complaints against the Latvian state. Additionally, it is worth pointing out the fact that there are people living in Latvia who, as members of the Interfront group, fought against Latvia’s independence, called for the preservation of the evil empire that was the USSR, still deny the fact of Latvia’s occupation, still excuse Soviet totalitarian crimes in the Baltic states, and voted against Latvia’s membership of the European Union and NATO.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are discussing the Latvian case precisely because it is unique. The Latvian non-citizens are not nationals of any state and they have no right to participate in any elections. All adult bearers of the status of non-citizens of Latvia were permanent residents of the country in the early 1990s. The last time they had the opportunity to enjoy voting rights was 19 years ago, i.e. in March 1990, when the Supreme Council of Latvia was elected. One and a half years later, the very same Supreme Council deprived one third of its own voters of their voting rights. This is a unique case in parliamentary history.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner spoke only of the integration of non-citizens into society and their naturalisation. However, such an approach puts things into reverse order: non-citizens are already a part of society – 32% were born locally – and for many, the procedure of applying for citizenship of their own country is humiliating and they do not go through naturalisation on principle.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Latvian political elite, depriving this essential part of the minority population of their basic rights is an instrument for preserving power. They are using the old method of divide and rule and, therefore, action on behalf of Latvia’s non-citizens must be taken by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have heard in this debate how Latvia’s democracy, independence and all the decent norms of society were crushed by the two criminal dictators of the last century. Latvia was invaded by Stalin, then by Hitler, and then by Stalin again. The Latvian population was then subjected to imprisonment, deportations and executions. Stalin then imported not only Russian speakers, but Ukrainian speakers and Belarussian speakers.</p>
      <p sl="en">All of us, including Mrs Ždanoka, would condemn Stalin and his works today, but what do we do about it, Commissioner? Would you now publicly affirm, not only that you have no juridical right to make an intervention, but that all Member States of the Union should respect their full legal requirements as far as electoral law is concerned? I think that is important, not just for Latvia, but for all our countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Surely the answer is that if you feel strongly about this, like those many Russian-speaking Latvians who have taken citizenship, you should take the citizenship of the country of which you are proud, where you were born and where you live. Do not reject it. Do not ask for privileges if you do not want to play your part. You can take citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a Palestinian exile who took Latvian citizenship. If he could learn the language, I am sure that those Russian-speaking Latvians can do the same.

I understand all the historical injuries of our Latvian friends, since they were subjected to terrible assimilation during the Stalinist Soviet era. I am well acquainted with the practice, but nothing can justify historical revenge. I would advise my Latvian friends to follow the example of Finland, which was oppressed by Sweden for centuries, and yet Finland never took revenge on Swedish-speaking Finnish citizens. It is impossible either to deport or to assimilate several hundred thousand people, and so they must be given their EU rights. I am very much saddened by Commissioner Barrot’s words, because instead of the EU giving a clear sign that the situation is untenable and contrary to fundamental EU values, Mr Barrot throws up his hands and says that the European Union can do nothing.

Mrs Ferrero-Waldner agreed with me, but today certain members – authors of questions – are displaying a total lack of understanding of Latvia’s situation. If we add yet further to the rights of non-citizens, and include the right to vote in local elections, the number of non-citizens, which has halved since 1995, will, in all probability, not fall any more. Latvia’s citizenship law is one of the most generous in Europe. Any non-citizen can acquire full rights, including the right to vote, by becoming a citizen. Latvia’s non-citizens have come about as the direct result of the 50-year-long Soviet occupation. Certain political forces, which support the Kremlin’s so-called compatriot protection policy, are still manoeuvring, through these people, for an increase in their own political capital.

Unfortunately, public opinion surveys confirm that the majority of these people will never become Latvian patriots, but the majority of them are already patriots of another country. If they were to obtain power in local government, the next step would be, of course, demands for autonomy and for official status for their language. We can already see what the next steps could be, as shown by the development of the long-term situation in such places as Abkhazia and Southern Ossetia – Russian passports would be handed out in these self-governing areas. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Under normal circumstances, it would be possible to propose that permanent residents participate in local council elections, but we know all too well that the majority of Latvia’s non-citizens could hardly be described as having arrived in the country under normal circumstances. Their arrival is a direct consequence of the occupation of Latvia implemented by the Soviet Union. It is also the result of the Russification process carried out over five decades, violating the norms of international law. We all have the right to choose – to be citizens or to be loyal to our state, do we not? However, every choice also has its consequences and for that reason we can only blame ourselves, not the state which granted that freedom of choice.</p>

      <p sl="sv">What are the consequences for the Latvian people of fifty years of Soviet occupation? Why does a large proportion of the Russian-speaking population not want to apply for citizenship? What is Russia’s part in all this? Latvia needs our support, not our condemnation, in order to be able to encourage its non-citizens to apply for citizenship. To Mr Tabajdi, I would like to ask this question: why would Finland want revenge on Sweden and what does that have to do with this issue?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is normal for people in Europe to undergo compulsory schooling. This involves becoming familiar with the customs and the culture of the country in which you live, so that you are able to live there. Compulsory schooling involves learning the language of the country and possibly other languages. It also forms the basis for vocational training and shows how the culture of the country has developed and where it is heading. In addition, students learn about history. Compulsory schooling, as we understand it, helps people to live together in harmony. If you live in a country, it is clear that you must also be able to understand the language of the country. This is the purpose served by a good compulsory schooling system. Against this background, I would like to say that many of the problems in Europe could be solved by the efficient provision of compulsory schooling for all the residents of a country.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have listened carefully to both sides.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is very difficult, in this context, for the Commission to take over from the Latvian State to deal with this problem. All I can do in this situation is encourage them to undertake an internal dialogue, which I think would be desirable. Unfortunately, that is all I can say.</p>
