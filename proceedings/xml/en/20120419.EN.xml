      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we are at the conclusion of a process which started in March 2003. We have been working on this transatlantic data sharing deal for nine years, and I think that – whatever the outcome of today’s vote – one conclusion that we can already draw is that it is telling and disappointing that, after nine years of negotiations with our closest friend and ally, we can only come up with an agreement that commands half-hearted support from a divided House. I therefore think that, whatever today’s outcome, we need to have a closer look at how we deal with our transatlantic friends and at the position of the European Union in the transatlantic partnership. We need to reflect on whether we are not weak compared with our partner.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you all know, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) voted a couple of weeks ago and – to my regret – rejected my recommendation to vote against the EU-US agreement, so the position of the LIBE committee is to recommend adoption of the agreement. However, I think that everybody – or almost everybody, including those who will vote in favour today – still has a number of questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I would like to say something about a new element, namely the declaration of the European Commission, which we received yesterday and which, as I see it, does not change anything: it does not contain any new elements. It is only the European Commission’s interpretation and is not binding on the US, so it does not make us change our minds. With regard to the GUE resolution proposing to submit this agreement to the Court of Justice of the European Union: although I have great sympathy for it and it is very tempting, I am a Democrat and I am very reluctant to outsource political decision-making to the courts, and I think that this House should take its own responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">I said there are still a couple of questions that I would like to put to the Commission. The Commission has its own interpretation of Article 4 on the purpose limitation, but I am still curious to find out – and I am sure many colleagues here would like to know – how you conclude that systematic use of the data for other purposes is explicitly excluded. Which words in Article 4 lead you to that conclusion? How do you conclude that the use of PNR data for public health purposes, immigration policies and customs is explicitly excluded, and how is the use of the data for those purposes based on Articles 82 and 87 on police and justice cooperation?</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that much has been said about the retention periods. I would also like to ask the Commission about PUSH and PULL. You say that PULL will only be used in a very limited number of exceptional cases, but I would like to put some figures before you that we received from the Association of European Airlines. Just a few figures from 2010 and 2011 show that there are ad hoc PULLs tens of thousands of times a day. In December 2010, for example, there were 82 500 individual ad hoc PULLs a day. I would like to know: how you can conclude that that is exceptional?</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning judicial redress: the agreement specifically states that no rights may be derived from this agreement, either for individuals or for other legal persons. How can you come to the conclusion that there is full judicial redress for EU citizens? I realise my time is up and I would like to save the rest of my time for after the debate.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, honourable Members, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak here during the European Parliament’s debate on this important matter. I would like to focus on some of the more overarching considerations that I believe the draft agreement gives rise to. I will leave an account of the more technical aspects of the agreement to Commissioner Malmström.</p>
      <p sl="da">As you know, the question of the exchange of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data between the EU and the US has been on the transatlantic agenda for many years. At the same time, we have constantly received new insight into the importance of the use of PNR data in preventing and combating serious cross-border crime. In my view, there can be no doubt that PNR data constitute a very important tool for the law enforcement authorities’ efforts to deal with serious crime. We have a whole host of specific examples of this. This does not mean, however, that we should not lay down requirements for those authorities that wish to make use of PNR data.</p>
      <p sl="da">Considerable importance should always be attached to protecting the privacy of our citizens in connection with the prevention and combating of serious crime. This is the case, of course, regardless of whether we are talking about authorities in the EU or in third countries with which we have close cooperation in respect of the combating of crime. This draft agreement contains a number of new and improved guarantees – guarantees that the US authorities have undertaken to respect when PNR data is handled. The agreement is not 100% perfect, but the US authorities have gone to great lengths to meet us half way in a number of key areas. I am therefore convinced that the agreement constitutes the best result possible under the circumstances. Let us also remember that the agreement we are debating here today does not signify the end of the transatlantic dialogue on the use of PNR data.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to conclude my comments by expressing my considerable appreciation for the fact that Parliament has been prepared time and again to fight for the interests of European citizens. Few matters demonstrate this more clearly than the agreement that we are to vote on now. Thus, there can be no doubt that the prepared agreement text that we have in front of us here today is a result of Parliament’s very strong desire for the agreement to be renegotiated. That is precisely why I call on you to support the conclusion of this agreement. By doing so, you will not only be ensuring better protection for the rights and interests of European citizens and air carriers, you will also be sending a clear signal that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union is capable of getting tangible results. At the same time, we will be able together to demonstrate to the world around us that the EU institutions stand together when there are difficult issues to be resolved.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-011-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission recommends that Parliament give its consent to the new agreement for three reasons. Firstly, because – as the Minister said – the law enforcement authorities need PNR to address the security threats that the US is facing. Secondly, because this agreement is a major improvement to the existing agreement that is now running and which you asked me to renegotiate. Thirdly, because it is difficult to see any alternatives which would better serve the interests of EU passengers and air carriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the necessity of PNR data, the Commission has presented evidence to Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) on several occasions. It shows that PNR data is important in fighting terrorism and a major tool in fighting drug and people trafficking. For example, PNR has played a pivotal role in cracking some recent cases of terrorism – the Mumbai plotter David Headley, the New York City subway plotter, the Times Square plotter – and we have all read about the atrocities that could have been perpetrated in these cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, this is a major improvement to the existing agreement from 2007. It is a clear step forward from the draft agreement that the Commission presented to the LIBE committee in May, where we asked your advice. In that regard we did a good collective job in pushing the US to make further concessions. This is a good example of how the new Treaty of Lisbon works: the three institutions working together with very clear signals from the European Parliament and the Council so that the Commission could be very clear in its negotiations with the Americans.</p>
      <p sl="en">This good collective work brought more clarity, stronger reciprocity and a better protection of passengers’ rights to privacy, without undermining the effect of the PNR system and security on both sides of the Atlantic. It also reflects the concerns that you expressed in your resolution two years ago and respects fundamental rights and the principle of proportionality. Let me outline some details of this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement, unlike the current one, is one single legally-binding text written in ‘proper treaty language’. It strengthens reciprocity and security on the EU side by obliging the US to share leads derived from PNR data with the law enforcement authorities in the EU. It sets strict limits on the purposes for which PNR data may be used. This is a concern for many Members, as I am aware, and I also heard the objections by the rapporteur. I would therefore like to read out the declaration on behalf of the Commission:</p>
      <p sl="en">‘The Commission considers that the agreement sets forth a precise description of purpose and scope, clarifying the purposes for which PNR will be collected and used. The definition of terms and the detailed description of the uses of PNR in Article 4 ensure that the purpose limitation of the agreement is in line with relevant EU laws on the protection of personal data and privacy. The purposes for which PNR can be collected and used are limited to the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and certain transnational crimes.’ The agreement provides, in Article 4 (1), the first detailed definition of the terms ‘terrorist offences’ and ‘transnational crimes’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Article 4 (2) of the agreement allows for the potential use of PNR on a case- by-case basis for the protection of vital interests of any individual, or if ordered by a court. These uses are, both by their nature and in view of the experiences we had in the joint reviews, very exceptional. In Article 4 (3) the agreement clarifies how PNR may become relevant when passengers travel to or from the US. In this regard the agreement merely clarifies that PNR may, in accordance with its scope and purpose, be processed to identify persons who require further examination. This does not constitute a further purpose for the processing of PNR data.</p>
      <p sl="en">Article 4 (4) explains that the agreement is without prejudice to domestic law enforcement, judicial powers or proceedings, where other violations of the law of indications are therefore detected in the course of the use and processing of PNR.</p>
      <p sl="en">This provision aims to clarify that domestic powers are not affected by the agreement in cases where other offences are detected in the course of using PNR. This clarification does not affect or extend the purposes for the use of PNR.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of the joint review and evaluation mechanism set out in Article 23 of the agreement, and without prejudice to other matters that might be raised in this mechanism, the Commission will seek detailed information and pay particular attention to the respect of the provisions of Article 4 of the agreement. More specifically, the Commission will review respect of the uses of PNR under Article 41 of the agreement and request information on any cases in which PNR has been used, either for the protection of vital interests of any individual or, where ordered by a court, under Article 4 (2) of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission commits to keeping Parliament fully informed of these and other aspects and to presenting a full report to Parliament and to the Council, as foreseen by Article 23 (3), without delay at the end of the first joint review and of other subsequent reviews. If, following the joint review, Parliament states in a resolution that there are serious deficiencies in the application of the agreement and calls for the suspension or the termination of the agreement, the Commission commits to considering Parliament’s political request with the utmost attention while deciding on whether to make a proposal, in full respect of the procedures and competences defined by Article 218 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having examined the scope, let me return to some other points. The agreement reduces the retention period for which PNR data may be stored by US authorities from 15 to 10 years for serious transnational crimes. Only for terrorist offences would the data be used for 15 years as under the existing agreement and – an important new element – PNR data will be depersonalised six months after it is sent by the carriers, making those data elements which can be linked to an individual passenger invisible.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also important safeguards on data provisions. In order to prevent illegal profiling, in particular, the agreement prohibits automated decisions affecting passengers. A human being must always take the final decision. New rules on data security are included to prevent data being lost or disclosed to the public. The agreement clarifies and strengthens passengers’ right to access, correct and, where relevant, delete the PNR data stored in the US databases. It also contains a detailed provision on administrative and judicial redress under US law. The rules on sharing onward transfers of PNR data have been tightened. This can happen only on a case-by-case basis, not in bulk, and only for the specific purposes of the agreement itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement is very clear on the method by which PNR data can be transferred: all air carriers must transfer data by the ‘push’ method within two years. The aviation industry has assured the Commission that air carriers are prepared to make the necessary investment in that timeframe. ‘Pulling’ of data by the US authorities will not be entirely prohibited, but the conditions governing this are precisely defined and limited to exceptional cases. In the current agreement, ‘push’ is not the norm. Now it becomes the norm. ‘Pulling’ is very exceptional and its use will be logged and, of course, checked thoroughly by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, there are provisions to ensure that the agreement is correctly applied. Several bodies from within and outside the US Department of Homeland Security will have independent oversight over it. We will have regular joint reviews and a full evaluation after four years. In order to make this effective, there will be records and logs of processing of PNR data. There are also clear rules on the resolution of disputes between the EU and the US and on suspension and termination of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recognise that many Members still have questions and think this is a difficult decision. I fully respect that and am ready to respond to all your questions. This is an international agreement. Like all international agreements, it is not 100% perfect. We have to give and take. The Commission has presented to Parliament and the LIBE Committee a draft agreement from May. There you gave clear instructions on where to make changes. We went back to the US and achieved a lot of those changes: on purpose limitation, scope, retention periods and other points. We now have an agreement that fully respects EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">This brings me to my final point, on the absence of better alternatives. Further negotiations with the US are not a real option – so what will happen if you vote it down today? What will the consequences be? It would be damaging for the transatlantic relationship because this data will be collected anyway and we would lose a very important chance to influence US policy on the use of that data. Secondly, we would leave the air carriers in a very difficult situation because they will be required to transfer the data, but there would be no legal basis in the EU for this transfer. So this would leave us in legal limbo, with potential lawsuits by passengers and a very difficult situation. Finally, and most importantly, we would fail to protect the interests of the more than 48 million passengers flying from the EU to the US every year. In the absence of the agreement, there would be no binding international rules to protect the passengers’ privacy.</p>
      <p sl="en">One cannot exclude the possibility that there will be bilateral agreements with the US between our Member States, but I do not believe that the Member States could bilaterally obtain a level of protection of passengers’ rights that goes beyond what we have achieved today. For all these reasons, I ask you to endorse the new agreement today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her dedicated and exemplary work. I agree with many of the criticisms expressed by Ms in 't Veld and have supported them in the past, in part at least. We always reach a point, however, where people need to take responsibility. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf I would state that we now need to deal with the realities of the situation, rather than taking recourse to ideological or theoretical positions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that the US has been gathering this PNR data for 10 years without a single complaint. It is also the case that none of us wants to put a stop to data traffic, even if we are not in favour of the agreement. You have just said so yourself. Nor do we want to bring air travel between Europe and the US to a standstill. The fact is also that the US has a right to know who enters its territory. In my opinion, it is also a fact that the legal services have all made oral indications that this agreement is better than the alternatives. This is the reason why we need people to take responsibility here. After all, that is what we have been elected to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to take responsibility for our citizens, as otherwise they would be abandoned with little protection and few rights. We need to take responsibility for the airlines, as otherwise, as the Commissioner also pointed out, they would be left with absolutely no legal certainty. We also need to take responsibility for the EU as a contracting partner in questions of data protection and security, as well as responsibility for a good balance between security and data protection. Hence we are generally in favour of this agreement, even though it is by no means perfect. If we want to protect our citizens and offer them better data protection, then we also need to take responsibility here and vote in favour of this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">blue-card question. − Mr President, I have a question for Mr Voss and his political group.</p>
      <p sl="en">He rightly points out that there needs to be a legal base for the transfer of passenger data, so I wonder why this House has not reacted to the fact that, for three and a half years now, data has been transferred to Canada in the absence of any legal base and that, under the US secure flight programme, data is being transferred from Europe to the United States for flights not going to the United States, while this House does not seem to care.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why is it that we want a legal base in one case and not in the other cases?</p>

      <p sl="de">blue-card answer. – Mr President, on the one hand, we always want to see a legal basis. It is naturally unfortunate at present that things are not working out with Canada as we might have wished. On the other hand, overflight rights naturally involve crossing into the sovereign territory of another country. Naturally this also requires the relevant legal basis. Accordingly, it is absolutely correct to say that we need a basis We intend working towards achieving this. We are not closing ourselves off from any legal basis in this case. We simply need to wait and see what the negotiations with Canada may bring. This is what we are waiting for and this is also why we intend to do all we can to ensure that an appropriate legal basis is established.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, speaking for the S&amp;D Group, we will be having a free vote. In committee there was a small majority in favour of the PNR Agreement, but you will hear arguments against that agreement from our shadow and others.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will be speaking in favour of this PNR Agreement and will vote for it, for the following reasons. Our group had three critical aims. We felt that this agreement, despite – as others, including the Commissioner, have said – no international agreement being perfect, was one whose scope was just too wide and went beyond terrorism; we said there was too long a retention period; and that it was taking in ‘pull’ methods as well as ‘push’ methods. In the end, two out of three of the critical key concessions were included.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two out of three was enough, in my opinion, for us to say that this agreement was enough. That was a very difficult judgment to make, but the scope was substantially narrowed: minor crimes were excluded and the retention period for serious crimes reduced. Also, although the USA has not fully agreed to move fully on the pull / push issue, data will now only be pulled in exceptional cases where there is a serious and urgent threat. This is by no means perfect, as the Commissioner and Minister have said, particularly as regards the push / pull issue, but we had to reach a conclusion at some point, following difficult negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In committee, a small majority from my group felt that, while this agreement did not meet all our requests, it is undeniable that the text has been fundamentally improved. It constitutes the only legal and binding framework for the transfer of EU-US PNR data. A ‘no’ to this agreement, as many have said and will say, will leave a clear position of 27 bilateral agreements with no common rules, no EP monitoring and citizens being left in a legal void and being subject to contrasting regimes, which I believe is not in the interest of European Union citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, concerning difficulties about setting a precedent, the agreement clearly states that it will not constitute a precedent for other agreements in this field. That is, in my view, satisfying when we look at the agreement as a whole. This is not a perfect situation, and what we have to say to the Commissioner – and this is certainly true of those in my group who would want to support this agreement – is that the Commission should take Parliament seriously when it reviews this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, we do not have the political power to terminate this agreement if it goes wrong and strays into other areas. If we support this agreement then you must support us and take us seriously, politically, should it go wrong or go beyond the remit that you have set.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, colleagues, this is a controversial agreement because, while its aim – fighting terrorists through preventive means – is welcome, it undeniably interferes with the protection of other equally important values such as privacy and data protection. I am not the only person saying that the agreement violates this right and EU legislation; the European Data Protection Supervisor demonstrated it in a thorough analysis. What is more, the scope of the agreement goes far beyond combating terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many say it is a better agreement than the previous one – which only means it is less bad than the previous one – but it remains an agreement with severe consequences for our fundamental rights. I respect the fact that the American authorities and lawmakers are interested in their citizens’ rights, but I believe that we are entitled to care above all about the protection of our own European citizens’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has been said that, without this agreement, our air carriers will violate EU legislation on data protection because if they want to land in the USA they will continue to transfer data. But you must remember that the agreement obliges the air carriers to implement the ‘push’ obligations in two years, which means investing a huge amount of money in equipment and software to transmit all data to the US authorities in real time.</p>
      <p sl="de">What if some of the air carriers are not able to implement this obligation? Big companies will probably do it, but either smaller companies will be forced out of business by this expenditure or the current situation will continue. They will allow the extraction of data by the American authorities directly from their computers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, about three years ago, just a few metres from this spot, the European Court of Human Rights issued a decisive judgment on the relation between criminal prosecution interests and the right to respect for private and family life. In the case of Marper v. the United Kingdom, the Court declared the gathering of personal data in national databases without clear evidence of need and without stringent restrictions to be unlawful.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two years ago, just a few kilometres from here, the German Federal Constitutional Court made a finding in relation to the retention of telecommunication data and came to the conclusion that only the most extraordinary circumstances can justify an obligation on private businesses to retain personal data without cause, even for just a few months. Shortly after this, the European Parliament refused to approve an agreement that obviously failed to comply with these criteria in any way. In a resolution, we clearly indicated that data retention for up to 15 years was disproportionate. We also indicated that the use of such collection of data without due cause could only be permitted within the most stringent restrictions, for example to combat terrorism or organised crime. We also made it clear that wholesale searching, or profiling, of information must not be permitted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ms Malmström, this agreement allows all data to be used and processed. It is not a question of accessing isolated data, but rather of processing all data. That is the principle that underlies this measure: a wholesale search, automatically comparing all information relating to anyone travelling to the US with threat profiles. We must be very clear about this: such searches openly contravene European law. At this point I need to direct a question to the Conservatives and Social Democrats in the European Parliament: Are you not ashamed of yourselves? Are you not ashamed of flouting the law so openly? Do you really think that the US Congress would debate the sovereignty of our laws with the same degree of commitment? That is absurd.</p>
      <p sl="de">What concerns us here is not the question of whether the US can decide for itself what measures it may or may not take, but rather whether or not we Europeans are willing to legitimate these measures. I must be honest: we cannot legitimate this. A large number of citizens will be very disappointed if the European Parliament approves this agreement today after 10 years of debate, despite the fact that the provisions it contains are unchanged. For this reason, I can only urge you to uphold the honour of Parliament and vote no.</p>

      <p sl="en">I just want to seek clarification on the issue of proportionality as opposed to purpose, because I think that for many people – especially those who are not lawyers – it might be disturbing to think that giving up some of our privacy and data protection rights might be proportionate to the noble aim of preventing terrorism.

Naturally the combating of terrorism and organised crime is a necessary objective and also, in my opinion, an important measure that we in the European Union must pursue – in close partnership with the US. There is no doubt about that.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question is: can this be achieved through the mass analysis of data belonging to numerous innocent individuals? Do we not rather need greater cooperation in investigating genuine suspects, in other words cooperation between police authorities when dealing with suspicious situations? We are moving in the wrong direction by spending more and more money on analysis centres and data centres where more and more innocent people are analysed, while at the same time cutting the resources available to the local police working on the investigation of genuine suspects. This should not be the case. We need further debate on this issue here in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, those who report on the activities of this Parliament have attached the word ‘controversial’ to this agreement, but the improvements to the text during our long deliberations in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) have received support from across five political groups, as well as from the Council and the Commission. I disagree with the rapporteur. These improvements are significant. Despite that, certain individuals and certain groups in Parliament do not trust the judgement and legal authority of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">A negotiation between two sides, two parties, two countries or two allies will never result in a perfect agreement and we cannot, and should not, expect that. However, the United States is our most trusted third-country partner, whose security vulnerabilities and recent history cannot, and should not, be ignored. Neither can we ignore the proven success and value of using PNR data in the prevention and prosecution of terrorism and of the most serious of crimes in many of our European countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also ask ourselves what the alternative is – 27 bilateral agreements, no legal uniformity or clarity for air carriers, no rights of redress for our passengers? No, those are neither good nor acceptable alternatives to this House. Members here who do not see this agreement as necessary must explain that to their electorates, but I and my group will be voting in favour in the knowledge that, at the end of the day, whilst it may not be perfect, this agreement is an integral and vital tool in the fight to ensure safety and security for all European citizens. Our citizens have a right to be able to travel safely.</p>

I can say with some certainty that, although I am not American, I do know a lot of legislators in the United States – as does Sir Graham – and I am pretty confident that the United States legislators would decide to do whatever was necessary to protect not only their own citizens but the other citizens of the Free World with whom they have dealings.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we see increasing moves by governments to limit our personal freedom and privacy, citing the need to protect us from the threat of terrorism and organised crime. However, we have to be extremely cautious in allowing our freedoms to be removed, because once they are gone it is very hard to restore them.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to ask if we have any particular reason to trust our governments. Legislation intruding into the citizen’s right to privacy should be proportionate, limited and controlled. Once it is enacted we need to be sure that its scope cannot be widened at the whim of government.</p>
      <p sl="en">This kind of legislation should never have been proposed by the Commission in the first place. It probably comes under the jurisdiction of international law. It should be devised under international agreements by sovereign nation states. The legislation is also unacceptable because it is one-way traffic between Europe and the USA. We have to give them our citizens’ personal information, but they do not have to supply theirs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left intends voting against this agreement because it nullifies an elementary right of EU citizens, namely the right to the protection of personal data. Ms Malmström, I can only shake my head in despair at what you have had to say. You seem to be chasing an imaginary level of security that does not exist and that will not come into existence with this agreement or any other agreement of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are not talking about a small amount of travel information about European citizens, but rather about the combination of this information with other long-established databases, enabling profiling and thus the monitoring of individual citizens. We reject this agreement because no adequate evidence has been provided – not even by you, Ms Malmström – of the possible benefits of this agreement. We also oppose it because proportionality and purpose limitation are taken to absurd lengths when millions of data records belonging to innocent citizens are retained. We reject it because the use of this data goes far beyond the purpose you have indicated – the fight against terrorism and the combating of serious, organised, cross-border crime.</p>
      <p sl="de">Article 4 contains an escape clause that also needs to be discussed. This clause significantly widens the purpose for which data can be used. We cannot support this agreement because it involves the processing and forwarding of the PNR data to an authority, the Department of Homeland Security, where the intelligence services hold power, and even to third countries; none of this can be controlled by Parliament, so that there is no guarantee of transparency. We reject the agreement because the period for which the data is to be retained goes against all understanding of proportionality and appropriateness, whereby even sensitive data can be retained for 30 days and possibly even longer. This is scandalous.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is quite impossible for our group to vote in favour because there is no serious provision for judicial remedy. The judicial remedy provisions contained in the agreement are laughable. All that is offered is a limited right to information and it is not even possible to take legal recourse according to a proper data protection law. This is just not possible. Judicial remedy is transformed into the obstruction of justice. To Mr Voss and the other Members who intend voting in favour of this agreement I would say: if our own EU Treaties mean anything to us, then we must reject this agreement. It is all a question of responsibility, Mr Voss, namely responsibility to the citizens of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the primary responsibility of a government is the safety of its citizens and, accordingly, each Member State of the EU has a responsibility to protect its citizens against terrorism. No country should ever allow itself to be hampered in that respect because of interference from Brussels. After all, our citizens are right to expect security. Countries should therefore make their own decisions as to who may enter their territory and under what conditions. This, obviously, also applies to countries outside Europe. The United States knows very well how to conduct the fight against terrorism, so what is it that Brussels is actually interfering with?</p>
      <p sl="nl">If a country requires, for security reasons, personal data from anyone who wants to enter its territory, then that is not only its right, but also its duty. If a citizen does not want to hand over his or her personal data, he or she will then not be able to enter. That is a personal decision and Brussels has nothing to do with it. Mr President, let me be clear, personal data are purely and simply the property of the individual, not of companies and certainly not of Brussels. It is, therefore, absolutely not up to Brussels to negotiate disclosure or non-disclosure of personal data of EU citizens to third parties.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, terrorism is a threat to us on a daily basis and we must take that seriously. However, this agreement does not even recognise that Islam is one of the greatest sources of inspiration for contemporary terrorism and that is a disgrace. Brussels is naive and the Member States are accepting the curtailment of the responsibility they have for their own citizens. And I hold that against them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bødskov, we should admit to each other that we are all struggling to uphold data protection for our European citizens. We should also listen seriously to what Mr Watson underlined in his short speech, namely that the fight against terrorism is a common cause and that the people who experienced the terror attack in Toulouse should also be remembered in this House. We need to weigh up both arguments.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) clearly recognises the United States of America as our partner in the global challenge that is the fight against terror. We see the US as a partner and wish to work with it. I believe that we should avoid getting involved in this role play where the US is the bad guy that wants our data, while we Europeans reap the benefits of the results of the analyses, which will, after all, also be available to the European authorities. We must all shoulder our responsibilities, which means that we Europeans must take action.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every country has the sovereign right to decide how people enter its territory and what information it requires. Just as we are in discussions on this issue with Canada and Australia, so we are now also in discussions with the US. This agreement will offer us greater legal certainty. Anyone voting against the agreement is voting for less legal certainty. These are the alternatives on offer today.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the Commissioner for making it clear that Europe is stronger when it acts collectively and that the European Union can achieve more than 27 countries negotiating separately. The PPE Group supports partnership with the US, which is why I would like to take a look towards the future. The reason why we are discussing a framework agreement on data protection is because the interchange of data will become more important in the future. For this reason, I would also call on the US to stay at the negotiating table and to take the Europeans’ offer seriously, so that we can draw up global standards for data exchange and data protection. If we in Europe and the US manage to conclude a joint framework agreement, then there is a chance that we will be able to establish global standards. This would represent genuine added value for the citizens of Europe.</p>

As you know, the terrorist’s trips from Toulouse to Pakistan and back were known about, so what would you have done, Mr Weber? Would you have prevented him from travelling? How would you have managed to prevent it? Is there some way to have prevented the Toulouse attacks using passenger name record data? They were used, in fact, and did not prevent the attacks.

It is a question of how terror funds itself. It is a question of who has had phone contact with a terrorist. That is why we need to discuss data retention. It is also a question of the movement profile of a terrorist or possible perpetrator. The overall picture is what counts. I never claimed that just one data record would provide a result. What I did say, however, is that we need to uphold the data protection interests of our citizens, while at the same time considering what authority and what data we need to give to criminal investigators to enable them to do their job, namely to foil future terror attacks. Careful consideration is needed here. Those who reject the agreement today must also respect the fact that some data will simply remain unavailable. I said nothing more.</p>

Why should their request not also be given legitimacy by the European Parliament? How would you respond if these countries also wanted other measures to be legitimated by the European Parliament?

If we take a look at the agreement, we have an organisation that has the right of initiative when it comes to negotiating an agreement and the resources to evaluate it, namely the Commission. The Commission’s legal services have stated that the agreement is in order. This is the legal situation. If others disagree, whether fellow Members of the House, Member States, or European governments, then they are completely at liberty to take the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to have it examined there. That is our legal system. I have absolutely no problem with that.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, to imply that a person is contradicting the law, despite the fact that the Commission’s legal services’ indicate that it is in order, is taking things too far.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I have the honour of chairing the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, where this matter has been the subject of detailed, careful and lengthy debate. As a result of that intense debate, there was a democratic vote expressing the will of the committee, reflected as a majority decision: 31 votes in favour of the agreement and in favour, therefore, of giving Parliament’s consent to the conclusion of the agreement and 23 against, with one abstention.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that that vote reflects recognition of the work done in the course of the negotiation. First of all, with a view to limiting the purpose, insofar as the other party’s original desire (which, clearly, never leads to a perfect result) to include all offences punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, has been reduced to terrorist offences, serious transnational crime and offences punishable by more than three years of imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is also confirmation of the principle of retention, for a fixed period of time, reducing and limiting the data retention period to five years and requiring data to be anonymised from five years onwards, except for terrorist offences, where data is retained for a period of 15 years.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, a reasonable balance has been achieved with regard to the guarantees that are offered in terms of affirming the principle of data mining (known as the PUSH system) and the non-discriminatory nature of the means of redress offered to citizens affected by the data setting system.</p>
      <p sl="es">From that point, what we have is affirmation of the principle that Parliament has the opportunity to take part in shaping the negotiating will of the EU and, accordingly, to play a relevant part when negotiating with other global players, which is undoubtedly the case with the US.</p>
      <p sl="es">The alternative, clearly, is to abandon the 27 Member States to bilateral negotiations and I think that people appreciate that negotiation by the EU as a whole makes us stronger, while abandoning the negotiation to the 27 Member States would make us more vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time it is acknowledged that, in practical terms, this means that citizens would be subject to the agreement that is currently in force – the 2007 agreement – which does not improve the position of EU citizens. Quite the opposite: taking them back into the 2007 agreement would worsen their position, it would reduce their safeguards rather than improving them and, accordingly, there is reasonable recognition that the agreement represents an improvement as compared with the status quo.</p>
      <p sl="es">It introduces a uniform right of judicial redress across the whole of the EU and produces a set of legal rules that airlines, which are responsible for transporting at least 42 million Europeans who wish to travel to the US, will have to comply with, with some shared rules on legal protection, in the terms set out in this agreement going forward.</p>

For us, this is a matter to be pondered and we follow a rational path, weighing up the arguments rather than being swayed by dogma. We are the only group in this House to follow such practice. We are aware that legal certainty, legal clarity and the question of the clarity of the wording are decisively important, in other words what is contained in this agreement and what the decisive points will be for us.

His father had phoned the US embassy to say: ‘My son is planning to do something bad’. The French authorities also had information about the terrorist in Toulouse. Our security services have information about individuals who are up to no good and they are not using it as they ought to. If our security services did everything they could with the information they have, that would, in my view, be the first step towards increasing our safety.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In contrast, what we are seeing emerge in the case of PNR is a form of token policy.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this has been a most enlightening debate. I think we have lost the plot here in that there seems to be – certainly from the rapporteur’s side – a lack of thought about ten years ago, when more than 3 000 people lost their lives in the United States of America. As someone who was the transport spokesman for my delegation at that time, I pushed for the adoption of security measures across European airports in order to improve security following that terrible terrorist attack.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certainly from my point of view, I have views about my human rights and I would find it a breach of my human rights if my government did not take sufficient steps to ensure my security when I travelled both within and outside the United Kingdom. Sometimes they have to take steps which I may not be too happy about, but it is all about balance. I have to tell the rapporteur that, at 37 000 feet, the terrorists do not really give a toss about what we like or what we do not like, or what questions we want to ask or what we do not want to ask. I spent more than twenty years in the airline industry, and I was aware of terrorists from the 1970s as a young person. Terrorists have no boundaries; they have no morals, and – most of the time – they have no justification for taking human life. They do not care. They want to make a statement.</p>
      <p sl="en">So all that I would say on this, if I may, is: what is PNR? It is really quite basic information. There is not much in addition to PNR. It is quite clear to me, Mr President, that my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have negotiated strongly on this report in order to secure the interests of EU citizens and the protection of everyone, and I believe that the safeguards are in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following 9/11, the use of PNR data has been a vital tool, not only in the USA but also in the UK in investigating the 7/7 bombings in London as well as in locating international criminals across the globe. I, along with my ECR colleagues, will urge this Parliament to support this agreement and to accept that a strong deal has been negotiated which will support all British and European citizens and assist them when they are travelling across the globe.</p>

      <p sl="en">blue-card answer. – Mr President, I take Ms Morvai’s comments on board. Airlines traditionally and historically have collected information from all of us when we book a ticket; they have done so for decades. The information they gather now is little different to what they gathered before 9/11. Ms Morvai is quite right: how much information is too much information?</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is that terrorism does not stop at borders; it is international. So we as citizens are obliged sometimes to give, with a heavy heart, information that we perhaps do not particularly want to give. It is sometimes difficult for governments and politicians to say that it is actually in all of our interests to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think there is a one-line straightforward answer on that. It is a result of the cumulative effect of terrorist attacks that have gone on over decades.</p>

Are you aware that, essentially, the ‘basic information’ is already automatically transferred along with the API information? All flight information relating to who is in which aircraft is automatically transferred on a worldwide basis.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before making my case I feel that I must tip my hat to Mr López Aguilar, the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for the very balanced way he conducted the debate and for his most dignified and sober words, which I do not think anyone has dared to refute with any sincerity or good reason.</p>
      <p sl="it">This morning, rather than getting into a series of philosophical or jurisprudential debates, we ought to take a responsible look at our fellow citizens’ right to safety. In particular we need to be thinking about those people such as workers and young people who have been victims of terrorist attacks on trains, perhaps, carrying workers, young people, and so on. We need to think about the right to safety, which must prevail over our personal and political considerations and those of a Eurosceptic group which I do not think will be able to vote in favour, as Mr Batten said.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Lega Nord Members of the House, meanwhile, will definitely vote in favour of this measure, not because we are not receptive to the serious and well-founded concerns over privacy, but because we think that right now there is a risk of widespread and possibly nuclear terrorism hanging over the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the fact is that the PNR agreement definitely does not offer sufficient protection for the personal data of European citizens. This is particularly the case because these data can also be passed to third countries at the discretion of the US. The PNR agreement will still be classified in the US as an executive agreement, which means that it will not be presented to Congress for ratification. Accordingly, it is not actually legally binding on the US. If, for example, the movements of Europe’s top managers can be plotted in full over a long period of time, then it is naïve to suppose that the US foreign intelligence services would not use such economic intelligence because of an agreement with Europe that is not even legally binding. This would be a completely naïve assumption.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, European passengers are not treated in the same way as US passengers and it must be remarked that the Commission could have and should have negotiated an improvement in the legal status of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the crux of the matter when casting our vote is this: we have to reply to the question, ‘does this agreement strike a fair balance between two equally important objectives that all of us hold dear?’ – that is to say, the protection of our citizens’ security and the protection of their privacy. It is in this context that we need to judge this agreement today before we are able to say yes or no to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">My reply to this question is: yes, I think we have struck a fair balance with this agreement, even though I am the first to concede that it does not quite live up to our high expectations on data protection and does not constitute the major breakthrough that we wanted. There are three reasons why I think we should support this agreement, most of which have already been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, having this agreement is better than not having it at all, both for security reasons and for the privacy of our citizens. The agreement provides a better data protection framework than the existing agreement of 2007 and, possibly, a better one than the bilateral agreements that we would have had to live with if we did not have it. Also, without the agreement, data would continue to flow, but without any safeguards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we have to admit that the United States has the right to request all the data it wants from the people who want to travel there. So we are doing everything in our power to secure their privacy when they choose to do so. In practice, without this agreement, we could end up with obstacles to flight traffic, extremely long waiting times for flight passengers and weaker safeguards concerning data protection and privacy. Lastly, yes, there is no doubt that the processing of PNR data helps the security of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should not be taboo in this House to say that protecting the security of our citizens is equally important. So, yes, it is far from perfect, but on balance our citizens are better off with it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, a number of years ago, terrorist attacks were given as the reason for introducing measures such as the retention of data or PNR. Obviously, terrorism alone is no longer enough to justify this gathering of data to our citizens, however. That is why we are currently talking about serious and organised crime and debating human trafficking; however the fact is that despite the millions of data records already on file, there have only been a few isolated successes so far. Ms Malmström argues that data protection has been improved, referring in particular to the fact that some data will be retained for ‘only’ 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Data protection begins at an earlier stage, however, for example when a specific limitation of purpose is applied or when restricting the data that needs to be collected. What is it that the agreement that is to be voted on today allows? The retention of millions of data records relating mostly to completely innocent citizens, that will be checked and rechecked with different criteria for almost every conceivable purpose for the next 10 years. Other criminal activities are punishable with a custodial sentence of three years. The German Government has this to say on its website: Those travelling to the US should consider that some offences that do not even warrant a judicial process in Germany are punishable with custodial sentences of several years in the US. Penalties must apply across borders. According to the wording, it is sufficient for the suspect to intend to cross the border. This is something we all want to do when we travel to the US, as we already have the ticket for our return flight in our pockets. Furthermore, any court can demand this information.</p>
      <p sl="de">Will we have better data protection? In view of the broad range of applications, the possibility of data being forwarded to other authorities and to third countries is more than questionable. It is also regrettable that there is at present no provision for the participation of data protection specialists in the planned evaluation. At this point I do not wish to go into the fact that, in the US, terrorist suspects frequently remain in prison for several years awaiting official charges. A number of these people are innocent. We need to combat terrorism. However, this formulation clearly goes too far. Every citizen comes under suspicion and is delivered up to the US legal system, instead of protecting our values and the rights of our people.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one final comment: Mr Albrecht asked whether those who vote in favour of the agreement should feel ashamed. No, no one should be ashamed about the way they vote today. Nonetheless, I am extremely concerned at the direction we would take by adopting this agreement and for this reason I am absolutely against it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, SWIFT, ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) and PNR (Passenger Name Records) are acronyms that we often hear and which are a source of concern to Europeans who do not really know what lies behind them. What is the reality hidden behind these names? Excessively generalised surveillance of passengers, and an agreement which means that if I take an aeroplane, the United States will know about my dietary tastes, my behaviour at the airport, aspects of my health, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Without going over all the arguments that have been advanced this morning in a long but fascinating debate, I would like to remind you that, since 2007, we have been calling for guarantees, such as red lines, which would have allowed us to obtain an agreement from Parliament. Yet we do not have this at the moment, either in terms of reciprocity or in terms of proportionality, as our admirable colleague, Mr Watson, reminded us in relation to the position taken by the United States, and I would question the proposals of Mrs Foster, which claim that passenger name records do not involve all that much. If they do not involve all that much, then let us call for reciprocity from the United States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is unacceptable to abdicate our responsibilities in this way. It is up to us to create the conditions of balance, of European democracy, between the security of combating terrorism and the preservation of liberties. That is why I will vote against this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, finally, since the start of this debate there have not been many fellow Members who believe that this agreement does not, in one way or another, undermine the fundamental rights of European citizens. To put it simply, some people are saying ‘It’s better than nothing. It would be worse if there was no agreement. In the end, it’s worth chipping away a little at our rights if we can see a corresponding benefit in terms of security.’ That is what we have been saying recently.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet we know perfectly well – we have not only been saying it, but we have also demonstrated it – that a policy of combating terrorism, in order to be effective, rather than just being moral or meeting international obligations, must respect the totality of human rights, international law and our obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is extremely hard to believe that this agreement could not be demolished by a court, if ever we in this Chamber were not able to shoulder our political responsibilities, because that is what this is actually about. Will we manage to stand beside the citizens of Europe – past evidence shows that they can only rely on the European Parliament in these areas – or will we allow ourselves to be overawed by threats? We have seen what happened in the past. With regard to the system implemented by the CIA, when there were secret prisons, illegal transfers and torture on our territory, who stood beside us in the Council and in the Commission to set up inquiries and find out who is responsible? No one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want to cooperate. We have no mechanism of accountability when the services operate outside the legal framework. This is a serious matter.</p>

      <p sl="fr">To be frank, I think it is not sensible to go down a road – and we are going to say this to the European citizens – which would lead to them becoming involved in an American-style system for fighting terrorism, with military tribunals in the absence of procedural safeguards, endless cases of imprisonment and detention without charge.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Parliament adopted two motions for resolutions by a majority in 2010. This House clearly formulated conditions in these two motions. The fact is that this agreement runs counter to these conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, profiling is still not entirely excluded. Secondly, the pull method is still possible. Thirdly, the purpose of forwarding data has still not been adequately specified. It can also be stated on a general basis that the purpose of collecting and storing mass data has not been explained at all and that the European Commission has not come up with a single alternative. Overall, it is worth noting that this agreement has given rise to considerable concerns in relation to the judicial rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and in relation to the fundamental rights enshrined in the European Charter. For this reason, I naturally do not intend voting in favour of this agreement. I believe this House would be well advised also to reject this agreement in order to remain credible and to meet its own conditions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the weakness in this agreement that all my fellow Members have complained about – including those who will voting in favour – is rather understandable if you refer to the words of both Ms Malmström and the Council, who spoke quite clearly about new and important concessions included in the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is precisely the point: we are talking about concessions, which means something quite different to the recognition of legal prerogatives. This is the real problem – more cultural than political, I would say – in current relations between the European institutions and the United States authorities. This is the problem that has allowed the US authorities to hold separate negotiations with each Member State rather than dealing with the institutions of the EU. No European foreign minister or prime minister has not been brought up to speed on this issue in recent months.</p>
      <p sl="it">Regardless, and acknowledging the objective truth of this fact, I think we should vote in favour not only because of concerns over safety but also because of the progress made in this agreement. That is because, honestly, a united and incisive EU stance cannot be put together overnight; it is not possible to shift the responsibility for ensuring the rights of all European citizens to the EU in a single step.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is something we are doing on a day-to-day basis and I think our fellow Member Mr López Aguilar showed this brilliantly by describing just how animated and in-depth the debate was in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the European Parliament has the right of consent in respect of the agreement on the use and transfer of Passenger Name Records. This was the case with the SWIFT agreement as well, where we voted no. We did so not only because of problems with its content, but also because we had not been supplied with sufficient information, and because the conditions formulated by the European Parliament had been disregarded during the negotiations. It is due in part to Parliament’s ‘no’ vote then that this time the negotiations were more transparent and there was dialogue between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Some of the expectations we had expressed at the beginning of the process have been incorporated into the draft agreement.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Nevertheless, the agreement is unsatisfactory on a number of points. Still, I believe that the European Parliament should approve this agreement. If we do not do so, the data will come into the possession of the United States in the same way as before, without any uniform guarantee to European citizens concerning the follow-up of their data or legal remedy. Things would be the same as before. Data protection would be regulated by bilateral agreements, in the conclusion of which individual Member States would have even less negotiating power than the European Commission has now. I do not consider this draft agreement to be a good one, but I am for its adoption because this is what provides the European Parliament with an opportunity to obtain, through common review and monitoring, information about the way the agreement is implemented and to demand its suspension and renegotiation if necessary. Passengers will be able to follow up on who is in possession of their data and what they are doing with them. It will give European airlines legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I insistently call on the European Commission to keep a close eye on the implementation of the agreement, the use of passenger data and the management of sensitive information, and to report everything to Parliament.

In this situation, the only approach is to have a legal framework, which has been achieved by adopting this agreement which, from the perspective of Europe’s citizens, albeit imbalanced, as has been mentioned, provides a rule of law that guarantees respect for their rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, we must unfortunately prioritise a number of fundamental rights. I agree with and respect personal data, but we also need to agree that European citizens are entitled to personal security as a fundamental part of the right to life. From this perspective, I believe that the improvements which have been made in this agreement, such as the fact that we can renegotiate and monitor the situation, and I have no reason not to trust the European Commission and US authorities on this, are arguments for voting in favour of this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, let us be frank: what this agreement gives with one hand it takes away with the other. It says it anonymises our data once six months have passed, but it is still subsequently possible to recover them for 15 years, or for more than 15 years where necessary. It says we can have judicial redress, but we know US law does not permit us to go before a US court if our data has been violated. It then tells us this is only to be used in terrorism cases, unless the authorities consider it necessary to use it in any other situation. That is why even fellow Members who are going to vote for this agreement have told us it is very possible that this agreement will be killed off in court.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that, if we vote for an agreement that does not ensure that the guarantees that are given are not withdrawn immediately thereafter, or that may not even survive in court, we are doing European democracy a disservice because the spectre of politicians’ lack of credibility is currently hanging over Europe. If the public were to start saying that we politicians have not defended their rights, on the basis that if we do not say anything they will not know – as Ms Foster said – what passenger name records are, meaning that we do not need to bother dealing with PNR because voters do not know what they are, and that we are content simply to leave them with no option other than to take their cases to court, that would mean that we are not doing our jobs properly and that we are helping to discredit politics in the European Union, and that is very serious.</p>

With this agreement, nobody will stand in line any less long than they currently do. With this agreement, nobody will be treated any better at a border crossing point in the United States than they currently are; and, indeed, nobody will have any sort of better data protection than they currently have. In case of need, the United States will just have to say that the sort of redress sought by a European citizen is not allowed by current US law. I am sorry, but I cannot agree to this.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, to be frank, the agreement is not perfect and there is certainly some basis for the arguments and, more importantly, the reservations expressed today. However, the question is this: what is the alternative? What is the best possible way of protecting the rights and the security of European citizens under the present circumstances? I believe that the answer is that it is with this agreement, which we are being asked to endorse today, with all its drawbacks, of which we are all well aware.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I should like us to consider another point. The European Parliament is being asked to vote today on an international agreement and an international agreement should take account of other parameters, such as the future of cooperation between the European Union and the US and the role we want for Europe in international developments in the future. The European Parliament rightly wants a more substantial role in negotiations on international treaties brokered by the Union and, as the European Parliament, we should have that role in the future. However, we must demonstrate that we have responsibilities, as the European Parliament, and that we know how to assume those responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, here is my opinion on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a response to the threats that the EU and the US must face, the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreement must be interpreted within the framework of the fight against transnational crime in all its dimensions. The strategy on the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs, the EU strategy against terrorism and the Stockholm Programme all refer to the need to establish close cooperation with third countries through exchange of information. The data that are gathered under the PNR Agreement are used for purposes of preventing, detecting, suppressing and pursuing and for those purposes only.</p>
      <p sl="es">This new agreement provides great improvements by comparison with the 2007 agreement. The PUSH method is recognised as the mode of transfer, there is greater protection for data gathered, the number of supervisory authorities is increased and there are advances in data evaluation, not to mention the right of citizens to request correction or deletion of their PNR data, with the possibility of administrative or judicial redress.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, the agreement respects the right to privacy in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Limitations may only be introduced where they are necessary and where they genuinely meet the general interest objectives recognised by the EU or protect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
      <p sl="es">In these circumstances, we have two options: vote in favour of the agreement, and benefit from the improvements that have been introduced, or vote against. In the latter case, we would create great legal uncertainty that could lead to the signing of bilateral agreements, and to penalties and obligations being placed on airlines.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must commit and ensure a high level of effective protection of personal data, which means that any transfer of PNR data to the US must be done in a secure manner and in accordance with EU law and that passengers can exercise their rights in relation to the use of their data.</p>
      <p sl="es">In light of this situation then, Madam President, I am in favour of this agreement to combat terrorism and transnational crime.</p>

      <p sl="de">blue-card question . – Madam President, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, you referred to the EU strategy against terrorism. This is quite a ‘catch-all’ strategy. However this strategy is also a framework within which our basic civil liberties are constantly subjected to further restrictions, despite the fact that it is these freedoms that make life in the European Union worthwhile. We have the SWIFT and ACTA agreements and we have this PNR agreement, among others. Do you not sometimes worry that in the end this will all be too much and that the thing we find so precious about Europe, namely our ability to live in freedom, will be increasingly constrained? I certainly believe this to be the case.</p>

The fact is, you use the language of Goethe and I use the language of Cervantes, and we have interpreters but, in spite of this, we cannot communicate with one another. Why? We cannot communicate because you speak of impressions and I speak of experiences.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would first of all like to emphasise two considerations that I think it is important to reiterate at the outset. Firstly, we are not hostile to passenger name records (PNR) in general and, more broadly, the fight against terrorism remains one of our major concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having given this preamble, I would like to say that, while we can acknowledge that a compromise is the result of concessions on both sides and is therefore imperfect, it should nevertheless not be made at the expense of one party. Here, however, the dominant impression is that the European Commission has not done well enough. At this stage, the arguments that have been advanced are not currently convincing us all to vote for this agreement. Although progress has been made, it is far from enough, and it does not in any way address the concerns expressed in May and November 2010 by this Parliament: a lack of respect for the rule of necessity and the principle of proportionality, an insufficiently precise objective, an excessively long retention period, an excessively broad scope of application and limited legal recourse. In short, we have a very long list of reservations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is an unfortunate situation because this agreement should have provided the opportunity to ensure that high data protection standards prevail, as behoves the European Union. I am also having trouble grasping the logic of the statement that the Commission is proposing to us. We are now promised that Parliament will be regularly and fully informed. That is great. We are also told that, if Parliament identifies deficiencies in this agreement and calls for it to be suspended, the Commission is committed to giving the fullest consideration to such a request. That is also great. It seems to me paradoxical, however, to hammer it home for several months that the agreement is not negotiable and then to assure us that the Commission will be able to negotiate it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a very uncertain bet. I will vote against this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Mr Bødskov, Commissioner, I am in no doubt that concluding an EU-US agreement, rather than concluding bilateral agreements, on passenger name record data is the best solution to guarantee our citizens a consistent approach and a higher level of legal certainty and protection.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I acknowledge Commissioner Malmström’s efforts in these negotiations with the United States, but the final result is far from what, in my opinion, we could and should be adopting. I will therefore abstain, for the following reasons, in particular. Firstly, it does not offer European citizens greater protection. Some people maintain that rights relating to accessing, correcting and erasing data, or to the possibility of administrative and judicial redress have been improved. As Article 21 of the agreement lays down that these rights can only be conferred if they are already enshrined in US legislation, this agreement could only confer new rights if the US Congress were involved, which it is not. Secondly, it uses the ‘pull’ system. The agreement with Australia made clear provision for the ‘push’ system, unlike this agreement, which also permits ‘pull’ extraction. I completely agree that the United States, as a sovereign state, has the right to require information about persons wishing to enter its territory. However, I do not agree with the possibility of going into airlines’ databases to extract the data that it needs. It is one thing for us to sign up to an agreement committing us to supplying data, but quite another to allow third countries’ security forces the use of our computers and databases. Thirdly, the use of sensitive data. The 2004 agreement prohibits their use, while this agreement allows the processing thereof. Fourthly, data retention: while data anonymisation has improved, on the one hand, data is now held for an indefinite period, on the other.</p>

      <p sl="it">An agreement is always better than no agreement though, and this one does help us to move forward.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, during this very interesting debate this morning, I have not heard, coming out of the wave of criticism, a single alternative proposal that could be pursued. International agreements are all about compromises. That is the nature of an agreement. You dance with each other. What is the alternative being offered to the citizens of Europe? Not to travel to the United States? That is the only alternative being offered. That means depriving them of their freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us have a minimum of realism in this debate. No, it is not an ideal agreement. Fine, but what else is there? The United States authorities can collect data in their country. It is their country that people are travelling to. Would we prefer them to have secret bilateral agreements with Member States? Would we want them to take away visa-free travel and suspend it? They could do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">This agreement is a great improvement over that of 2007. It is a significant step forward in providing data protection to our citizens. My vote is for protection, safeguards and freedom and security for the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, there are serious problems with the passenger name record agreement that the Commission has negotiated with the United States. We are concerned, above all, that European citizens do not have the right to a judicial review in the United States; that is, they do not have the same means of redress as US citizens. However, although this agreement is bad, it is a bit better than the 2007 agreement currently in force, and is far better than the bilateral agreements with the United States negotiated by European governments. In the case of my country, Portugal, the national parliament subserviently ratified one such agreement, against the serious warnings of the national data protection authority.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the European Parliament does not give its assent to this text, the very worrying bilateral agreements will come into force. If the European Parliament gives its assent to this agreement, the European public will, despite everything, be more protected and Parliament will be able to monitor the implementation thereof, in accordance with the agreement with the European Commission. That is why I am going to vote for this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the commitment of the European Union and the Member States to streamline the fight against international terrorism and transnational organised crime must be translated into specific actions that are in strict compliance with fundamental human rights and freedoms. New challenges cannot become an excuse to use unfair means to interfere with the fundamental rights and freedoms of EU citizens. The provision of passenger name records is one such intervention and therefore requires a respect for principles on the one hand and necessity and proportionality on the other. The process of obtaining, collecting, processing and storing data must comply with precise, predefined rules. The entire process must be subject to independent supervision so the principles that are required do not remain mere recommendations. Many uncertainties remain, and I therefore fear that the current agreement does not define safeguards for EU citizens in a sufficiently clear manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am not going to dwell on technicalities; I will rather try to make three points. First, before being concerned with the transfer of PNRs, we should be concerned primarily with their content upon collection. I do not see the relevance of, for instance, my trade union membership when booking a flight. Second, the data does not become public through transfer but through collection here in Europe. Third, our American friends want the data mostly to compare it with their own data already collected through other means.</p>

I could, in essence, continue from where the previous speaker left off. Of course when someone comes into your home, you will want to know who they are and what they want. However, you do not necessarily want to store data about them for long periods, also allowing others to access this information.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, you have stated, for example, that the data will be depersonalised after six months. That is correct. However, as you said yourself, this only occurs after six months. We need to take numerous concerns into account. It has also been stated that this data is gathered anyway. I do not see this as a reason to sign up to this agreement. There have been no complaints to date, according to Mr Voss. Likewise, I do not see this as a reason to sign up this agreement either. There is no need to rush. Negotiations with the US are not always a meeting of equals. I am aware of this from the EU-US air transport agreement.

In my view, the necessity and effectiveness of wholesale automated transfers of US-bound PNR data for counter-terrorism purposes has not been demonstrated. However, we need to face the fact that the United States is a sovereign country entitled to demand the information it deems necessary for its security from those approaching its airspace.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that, at this juncture, Home Affairs Commissioner Malmström has negotiated the strongest possible legal guarantees on behalf of the Union and our citizens. For all my reservations in this context, a rejection of this agreement would not prevent the flow of data to the US under bilateral agreements, which would offer our citizens little by way of guarantees of data protection. This has to be taken into account if we, as a Parliament, are to take a sensible and responsible stance.</p>

The truth remains, however, that if the United States wishes to maintain a good partnership with the European Union in the fight against international crime and combating terrorism, then it would be apposite for our positions to be more considered and balanced. Commissioner, I have no doubt that you have indeed done everything possible to obtain a good position for the citizens of the EU Member States; unfortunately, you have only managed to achieve what the United States has allowed you to achieve.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in 2007 the EU concluded with the United States of America an agreement on the use of passenger name records to legitimise and formalise the handling of personal data of EU citizens by the United States Department of Homeland Security. In May 2010, we refused to give our consent to the application of this agreement, as it does not take into account European standards regulating the handling of our citizens’ personal data. The new text of the agreement, which we are debating today, strengthens a number of provisions dealing with the protection of personal data and strengthens guarantees regarding the lawful handling of data. Even in the new version of the agreement, however, several shortcomings remain, which is why we rejected the agreement in May 2010. The present text must therefore be seen as some attempt at a compromise. The question remains, however, as to whether we have the right and mandate to milk our people of their rights and civil liberties using such devious means.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank everyone for this very good debate. I also appreciate the good cooperation I have had with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. Let me quickly answer a few questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, scope. The scope of this is to fight terrorism and serious cross-border crime, which carries a penalty of three years. Customs, migration and border controls are not additional purposes. The reference to vital interests applies to life-and-death matters and communicable diseases. This arose in only four cases during the review we did on the current agreement from 2007 to 2010. That is four cases, none of which involved European PNR data.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, court orders. In the US Constitution and some European constitutions, a court can ask for PNR data to be used to prove whether someone has been on a plane or not, for instance. This only happened once in our evaluation, so these cases are extremely rare and they are all logged.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, ‘push’ and ‘pull’. In this agreement – in contrast to the current one – ‘push’ is the norm. This has been welcomed by the Association of European Airlines and the international organisation of airlines. A vast majority of carriers already use this method and will be able to comply with the requirement to have ‘push’ capacity within two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, redress. It is spelled out in the agreement that anybody can appeal to the Court against a decision to refuse access because of his or her data under the Freedom of Information Act. The US Privacy Act does not give these rights to EU citizens, but the Traveler Redress Inquiry Programme is available for all decisions made by the US Government that may be subject to judicial review. It is also possible to claim compensation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the content of the data. The data registered are the data you give when you book an airline ticket. You do not say if you are a member of a trade union. You do not say in that booking what you intend to buy at the airport. The data is registered. I do not know how well informed passengers are about this (as was mentioned in the debate with Mrs Foster and others), but we say in the agreement that the US must inform passengers about this. This is a major improvement. Profiling is prohibited by Article 7 and Article 9.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has been said, the United States has the right to ask for data from an individual who intends to land on its territory, as does any country. They do it today, they have done it in the past, and they will do it in the future, as most of our Member States do. We are currently negotiating EU PNR, which I am looking forward to debating with you later. Why? Because our Member States think that this is a valuable and important tool to fight terrorism and – even more importantly – drug smuggling and people smuggling.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are here to do is to make sure that the transfer of data is used in a proportionate, limited way, with the strongest protection possible when it comes to fundamental rights and integrity. This is our collective duty. You asked the Commission to renegotiate the 2007 Agreement in force today. We all did that with strong support from Parliament, clear directions in your resolution and with the support of the Council as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not perfect. You did not get 100% of what you asked for. However, on all points it is a better agreement than the one we currently have. This is why we are asking for your agreement. We attach great importance to this agreement, as you all do. We will review it, and in the review, Mrs Sippel, there will be data protection experts present. I undertake – as I did earlier in my declaration – to be fully transparent and to report to you at all stages of these evaluations and reviews.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank you once again for the opportunity to participate in this debate here today. The topic that we have discussed here today is an important one, and the debate has once again demonstrated that this is an issue to which we all attach a great deal of importance. As has been evident from the debate today, this is not an easy issue, and many of the concerns that have been raised today have been discussed in detail. However, like Commissioner Malmström, I would like to say that it is the view of the Presidency that the agreement we have in front of us today is better than the one we currently have. That is essentially the important question that we need to answer. The agreement is and will be better than the one we have, and it will provide better opportunities to increase our efforts to prevent serious cross-border crime.</p>
      <p sl="da">We completely understand that some of you still have reservations about the draft agreement. However, I hope that Commissioner Malmström and I have managed to make it very clear that we obviously take your reservations and questions very seriously. At the same time, you should know that many of the questions that have been raised today have also been discussed in the Council. By way of conclusion, however, I would like to say and to emphasise that this agreement does not mark the end of the transatlantic dialogue on the use of the PNR data.</p>
      <p sl="da">The provisions of the agreement that relate to evaluations will ensure that we have the opportunity to make sure that the provisions of the agreement concerning purpose limitation are complied with in practice. I therefore think it is important for us to see this agreement as a positive step towards a new framework for the use of PNR data – a framework that provides room for improvement, but that also solves a pressing problem affecting both our citizens and our air carriers. As Commissioner Malmström mentioned, both Parliament and the Council will be involved and informed when the agreement is to be evaluated. That is something that I can, of course, fully and wholeheartedly support on behalf of the Council. Thank you once again for the opportunity to be here today for this important debate on a very important proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, very quickly, first of all, I would like to clear up a misunderstanding. I have said this countless times: nobody in this House disputes the need to use data in the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime, Mrs Foster – nobody. But we do dispute the use of these data for other purposes like communicable diseases, as the Commission said, and immigration and customs checks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to put a question to the Commission. You have a certain interpretation of Article 4 that is not shared by everybody, but what is key here is this: is it shared by the United States authorities and how do we know?</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, I would like to address Mrs Corazza Bildt. Yes, politics is about compromises, but certain things are not negotiable, like fundamental rights and EU law. I do not understand how we are able to reach a good agreement or an acceptable agreement with our Australian friends and not with our American friends and allies. That escapes me completely.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the analysis by our EPP colleague, Mr Engel, was spot on. Without the agreement, we do not have weaker safeguards, because the safeguards that are there are provided by existing US legislation and will still be there, even if we vote down this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">On push and pull, Commissioner, as Renate Weber right said, not all carriers will shift to ‘pull’, and you know and we know that this clause is not enforceable. Even if ‘push’ is in place, as it is today, ‘pull’ is still being used. This means that the Americans go into our computer systems and pull the data.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have not heard you answer my question: why do you qualify as ‘exceptional’ tens of thousands of pulls – up to 82 000 – a day? How, frankly, do you qualify that as exceptional?</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on monitoring. If the experience with the SWIFT Agreement and the monitoring of that is anything to go by, monitoring is a joke.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last question. Colleagues, ask yourselves, look yourselves in the eye and ask yourselves: if other countries knock on our door and ask – and we know that they will, as Qatar and Japan have already done, and South Korea and Cuba will come, South Africa will come, China and Russia too – are we willing to give them our data for use in profiling on the same terms as we are doing for the United States now? That is a key question.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The majority of air passengers will not know what passenger name records (PNR) are: a register for identifying passengers. Moreover, they will not know how this register is currently used. PNR can include a variety of information, such as name, address, passport number, credit card number, or even information on, inter alia , travelling companions and travel routes. It is this list of personal data on any passenger that is currently sent by airlines to the US Department of Homeland Security, now and always, in the name of the so-called ‘war on terror’; the pretext for all manner of breaches and glaring violations of citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees. The European Commission is complicit in all this. As the rapporteur rightly points out, unbeknownst to passengers, the number of passenger records sent to the US authorities is reaching tens of thousands per day. That is what has been happening in recent years. These data could also be sent to third countries. The European Parliament will now give its backing to this veritable Big Brother, as it has been supported in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – ironies of ironies – by the usual partners: the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. This decision is unacceptable. It justifies indignation, denouncement, mobilisation and struggle.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The fight against terrorism and organised crime can hardly be effective without the tracking and processing of banking and passenger traffic data. It is welcome that the agreements concluded between the EU and its allies on both the TFTP and the PNR address most of the human rights and data protection concerns raised by the European Parliament, incorporating guarantees for the prevention and subsequent remedy of any violations of rights into the agreements. I have called attention to the need for mutuality in the relations between the US and the EU on several occasions. What I mean by that is that the EU should not only be giving, but should as an equal partner also be receiving information vital to law enforcement from the US. It is debatable whether the EU needs a PNR of its own. An own PNR system would not only increase the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism but could facilitate true mutuality between the EU and its allies. It would be appropriate if the Commission finally clarified its ideas concerning the future of an EU PNR. An EU PNR that served as a single European framework for data processing and ensured equal access to information for Member States would be to the benefit of the EU, the Member States and the aviation sector at the same time. It is of course vital, and the agreement also gives reason for hope in this regard, to give particular priority to privacy and data protection guarantees when establishing a potential EU PNR system.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU-US PNR Agreement should be favoured because it is an effective tool for the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime. The US authorities have provided several concrete examples where the PNR data system had been crucial in disrupting major terrorist plots. The cases of David Headley, Faisal Shahzad or Najibullah Zazi, arrested before they could accomplish planned terrorist crimes, are strong arguments in favour of the security benefits this agreement carries. The agreement also provides for judicial and extra-judicial means of redress for individuals who may feel that they or their data have been improperly handled. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, however, no complaints of abuse of personal data have been recorded so far under the PNR agreement currently in effect. The conclusion of this agreement is a good opportunity for the EU to advance negotiations with the USA for the application of the reciprocity principle on the elimination of visas for all EU Member States, including Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Poland, in the framework of the Visa Waiver Programme.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We live in a globalised society where potential dangers are no longer confined to the borders of national states. The battle against terrorism has exposed some states to serious threats. This applies not only to a few European countries but also to the United States. The agreement with the US on exchanging passenger data enacts in law a current practice based on a provisional agreement made in 2007. Such data have been used for the last 60 years by customs authorities worldwide, and new technologies have helped facilitate their transfer. According to the draft agreement, information will be kept in a secure database, intended to be used principally for preventing and investigating cross-border crimes. It is important to point out that EU citizens enjoy the right to compensation if their personal data are used inappropriately. Signing this EU-US agreement, based on the model of other similar agreements (with Australia, for instance), is important with a view to strengthening cooperation, as this guarantees a continuation of the policy for waiving travel visas for citizens and the freedom of movement in a secure environment.</p>

      <p sl="lv">By approving the EU-US agreement on the use and transfer of passenger name records (PNR) in the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime, the European Parliament will allow greater legal certainty for both European passengers and air carriers to be achieved. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the entry into force of this agreement. This will be a considerable achievement, since the transfer of PNR to the United States has been a ‘hot potato’ in EU-US relations for years. Rejecting this agreement would mean that the United States could continue to insist bilaterally on the observation of lower standards with each of the EU Member States or even with air carriers. This would amount to a very unsuccessful outcome for Europe. As we know, Parliament rejected de facto the previous version of this agreement in May 2010, and asked the European Commission to reopen discussions on data protection with the US so as to reflect the concerns expressed in Parliament’s resolutions. Although the version of the document as it now stands contains significant improvements in relation to data protection and cooperation with the US security agencies – for example, the scope and data-retention periods are clearly defined – there were keen debates in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this thorny issue. This was not without cause: the agreement is truly far from perfect. Nevertheless, we are better off with such an agreement than with no agreement at all. It is the received opinion that the EU-Australia agreement on access to passenger name records is a very good example, which we should try to emulate. Hopefully, the agreement between the EU and Canada, which will shortly also be on our agenda, will contain high data-protection standards.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on trafficking in human beings.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-105-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Morten Bødskov" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, honourable Members, I would like to start the debate here today by thanking you for the opportunity to take part in today’s debate on trafficking in human beings, which is a very important and pressing subject.</p>
      <p sl="da">There can be no doubt about the fact that trafficking in human beings is a loathsome type of crime, which must be combated on all fronts. This is also a problem that we know cannot be solved at national level, but requires regional, international and also global efforts. In this connection, we need to coordinate European efforts to combat trafficking in human beings with those of our external partners. I am therefore pleased that the fight against trafficking in human beings is such a high priority for the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the International Organisation for Migration.</p>
      <p sl="da">I also attach a great deal of importance to the fact that six United Nations agencies have jointly issued a commentary on our directive from 2011, and I am sure that this contribution will prove to be useful when the Member States come to implement the directive ahead of the deadline of 6 April 2013. In this regard, it should be noted that this is a directive containing minimum rules. The Member States are therefore free to introduce more extensive rules than those specified in the directive. The UN’s recommendations are also directed at the Member States in connection with their transposition of the directive into national law. Thus, whether or not a Member State wishes to follow the UN’s recommendations is a national matter insofar as these go beyond the requirements of the directive itself.</p>
      <p sl="da">One of the requirements of the directive is that, in order to contribute to a coordinated and consolidated EU strategy for combating trafficking in human beings, the Member States should facilitate the tasks of an anti-trafficking coordinator. As you know, the Commission appointed the first anti-trafficking coordinator in March 2011. The coordinator’s role consists of providing general strategic guidance relating to trafficking in human beings, including in relation to third countries. I and the other members of the Council are particularly pleased that we now have an anti-trafficking coordinator, who does a very important job. The Commission will go into the coordinator’s mandate in more detail.</p>
      <p sl="da">Another important element in the directive is the provision stating that the Member States should appoint national rapporteurs or establish equivalent mechanisms. The rapporteurs’ tasks include assessing trends in trafficking in human beings, measuring the results of anti-trafficking actions, taking responsibility for the gathering of statistics and providing reports.</p>
      <p sl="da">In 2009, the Council decided to establish a network of national rapporteurs and equivalent mechanisms for monitoring trafficking in human beings. As also stated in the United Nations commentary, it is particularly difficult to assess the true extent of human trafficking. One purpose of this network is to improve our understanding of the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings and to gather reliable data. The network is accessible to EU institutions and agencies and to relevant international organisations, including, of course, the United Nations. The Council Presidency, in collaboration with the Commission, coordinates the activities of the network and chairs the meetings. The network meets approximately every six months, and the Council’s Secretary-General and Parliament’s Secretariat are invited to participate in the meetings. The most recent meeting took place in February of this year.</p>
      <p sl="da">I hope that answers your questions. If not, I am sure the Commission will be able to provide further information.</p>

    <intervention id="4-106-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think this is a very good opportunity to discuss this matter. Trafficking of human beings is a horrible crime. It goes on today, it affects millions of people – young children, women, men – and it is a shame. It is unacceptable that today, in 2012, this modern slavery still goes on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think – or rather I know – that the European Parliament has pursued this issue for many years,] and some Member States have been very quick to engage in these issues, while others have taken a little more time. However, I think it is fair to say that today everybody is very committed – Member States, the Commission, Parliament – to fighting this horrible violation of human rights. It is a priority for all of us, and it is very important for me personally.</p>
      <p sl="en">The directive to which the Presidency was referring and which was the subject of your oral questions is very important for preventing and combating the problem, as well as for protecting the victims. It is a reflection of our joint commitment. It has a comprehensive and integrative approach. It is centred on the protection of victims and on human rights. It is gender-specific and does not only focus on repression but aims to prevent the crime and to ensure that the victims of trafficking are given the opportunity to recover and be reintegrated into society.</p>
      <p sl="en">It brings robust provisions to deliver protection, assistance and support for victims. It asks, for instance, the Member States to ensure that all victims are dealt with on the basis of an individual risk assessment. Additionally, the Member States should establish appropriate mechanisms to identify, assist and support the victims in cooperation with different support organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are special provisions concerning children who are victims of trafficking. The Member States are obliged to appoint a guardian or a representative for each child victim and always to take into consideration what is best for the child.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding prevention, we fully share your concern on the need to put in place concrete preventive measures. The Member States are obliged to take measures to discourage and reduce the demands that foster all forms of exploitation. We also foresee the inclusion of a study on demand and supply in our upcoming communication on the strategy, with a view to better understanding the roots and causes of trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="en">The need for preventive actions in addressing the role of the Internet in recruitment, as well as in advertising services, was repeatedly brought up during the consultation with stakeholders when elaborating the strategy. The strategy which we are currently in the process of writing will therefore consider the best ways to reflect on the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the gender dimension, women, men, boys and girls can all become victims of trafficking. However, victims of trafficking are affected in different ways and to different degrees, so Directive 2011/36/EU and the Strategy for Equality between Women and Men should mainstream a gender-specific approach in all areas of human-trafficking policy and legislation, reducing vulnerability to trafficking and responding to victims’ needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Directive is a great achievement, and our focus now must be on transposition and implementation. The commitment of the Member States’ governments to enacting national legislation that would give full effect to the provisions is fundamental, and the Member States have one year left fully to transpose the provisions. In order to assist them – as has been mentioned – there is an informal contact group on the Directive. It brings together experts on the transposition of the Directive at national level. During these meetings, Member States can discuss questions related to this process that they consider important, and the European Parliament is invited to participate in these informal meetings.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, we welcome the joint United Nations commentary on the Directive and its strong focus on human rights. The commentary is a positive exercise by the United Nations’ agencies to combine the previously-adopted UN and Council of Europe legislation with the implementation of the EU Directive. It places EU policy in a global context, and this is crucial for consistency, as we are discussing a global phenomenon.</p>
      <p sl="en">You asked about the national rapporteur or equivalent mechanism. The Directive obliges Member States to set up these mechanisms. They will be responsible for the assessment of trends and measuring the result of the anti-trafficking actions: statistics, reporting, etc. Some Member States already have this in place, and others are now in the process of setting it up. The Commission will discuss, within the informal network, how best to implement this provision, and this will also be a question to be discussed in the contact group.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me inform you that the third group of experts on the trafficking of human beings was appointed by the Director-General of DG Home Affairs, Mr Manservisi. The call for experts was an open call, and the selection was made by a committee which ensured the presence of different specialisations and areas of expertise, as well as a geographical and gender balance. This group of experts included many human rights and gender experts, and they will feed into the Commission policies, advise us on policies and initiatives related to trafficking issues, help us to assess policy and assist us in identifying measures to be taken. Overall, this group of experts is a forum for the discussion of all issues relating to the trafficking of human beings.</p>
      <p sl="en">The anti-trafficking coordinator, Mrs Vassiliadou, took up her mandate a year ago. The Commission is in the process of providing additional staff for her in order to support her and ensure that she can fully exercise her tasks and priorities. She has been working on making anti-trafficking policies more coherent, such as by mainstreaming the issue in different policy strands and ensuring coordination between the different actors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Partly in order to ensure transparency, the anti-trafficking coordinator will have to contribute to the Commission’s biennial reporting on the progress made in addressing trafficking in human beings. In order to evaluate this process, as stated in your resolution on the prevention of trafficking in human beings, there is a need for better information gathering.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year, the Commission sent out a questionnaire to the Member States to collect data on the trafficking of human beings at EU level. We have received replies from everybody. A general overview of the data will be integrated into the strategy on which we are currently working, and the Commission will most likely be able to publish a separate analysis of this later this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Commission funds many projects aimed at preventing trafficking both within and outside the EU. Some projects address the root causes: for example, there is a project in Kosovo that aims to raise awareness amongst the most vulnerable groups in rural areas of Kosovo. More information on this project and others is available on the anti-trafficking website.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have an action-oriented paper aimed at strengthening the commitment and the coordinated action of the EU and Member States against trafficking in human beings. This will be done in partnership with third countries, regions and organisations at international level. The Commission has established an inter-service group on trafficking of human beings shared by the anti-trafficking coordinator. This group brings together diverse policy areas such as migration, asylum, development cooperation, trade, employment and gender policy, to name but a few. Coordination is one of the main objectives here, and that was the objective of last year’s anti-trafficking day, which resulted in a joint statement from seven agencies on ensuring future cooperation on trafficking between them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Much has been done and much is prepared. The strategy will be presented later this spring or just before the summer. I will be happy to come back and talk about this specific strategy once it is ready, but I would like to thank you for your strong commitment, for your engagement and for urging the Commission and the Member States never to give up on this and to make sure that we do everything possible to eradicate this horrible form of modern slavery.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, thank you for this opportunity for an exchange of views on the application and transposition of the directive. Over the past few weeks, we have consulted with a number of civil organisations about the tasks that await us, and one of the participants told us that this directive was a damn good one. Pardon the language, but I wanted to quote them precisely. Of course this does not mean that now we can sit back and relax after a job well done; in fact the lion’s share of the work is essentially still before us. Despite the fact that this is indeed a good directive, and we must thank the Commission and the Council for making it possible through their good cooperation, the directive itself also has its shortcomings which we will sooner or later need to remedy, such as the temporary residence permit directive, which makes support to victims subject to certain conditions, while this new directive provides unconditional support to victims.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, there are also deficiencies to be remedied with regard to the relations between the national coordinators and the European coordinator, and I feel that perhaps in the future it will be important for us to pay increased attention to the coordination of the various policies. The same applies to development policy, as even today we are not really taking into account how important it would be to give higher priority to the issue of human trafficking in development policy. We will keep a close eye on this new strategy and we are eager to see what results it will bring. My question is this: what added value can we expect from it?</p>

    <intervention id="4-108-000" speaker_id="28131" name="Anna Hedh" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="sv">Madam President, as rapporteur, I am proud of the progress we have made together with the Council and the Commission in connection with our adoption of the new legislation against trafficking in human beings. The directive takes a holistic approach with the focus on both preventive measures and the prosecution of human traffickers. It is now more than a year since the directive was adopted, and I am pleased to be hearing about its implementation from both the Commission and the Council today.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A few weeks ago, I was at a seminar with the EU anti-trafficking coordinator. There she announced that the most recent statistics available from the Member States indicate that a clear majority – over 70% – of the victims of trafficking in human beings are women who have fallen victim to the sex slave trade. Despite this being confirmed by a number of other studies, I find that there is resistance to talking about this fact. Instead of discussing sex slavery, which according to all available statistics accounts for the majority of cases, there is a tendency to want to focus on exploitation in other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is deeply regrettable, as we will never get to grips with trafficking in human beings if we do not have the courage to speak openly about all of its causes. A very significant part of the directive is concerned precisely with working to reduce demand and taking measures to diminish the actual profitability of trafficking in human beings. According to Article 18, the Member States are not only obliged to take action against trafficking in human beings, but also to take appropriate measures to discourage and reduce the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation related to trafficking in human beings. This includes examining the purchasers’ responsibility, irrespective of what type of slavery they are paying for. It is therefore particularly interesting to see how the Council and the Commission are looking at this in the light of the legislation. I look forward to the evaluation that we will eventually receive.</p>

    <intervention id="4-109-000" speaker_id="34234" name="Antonyia Parvanova" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, one year after the adoption of the directive on combating and preventing trafficking in human beings, Member States still need to take concrete action to put an end to trafficking and effectively protect the victims of such crimes.</p>
      <p sl="de">We hope that the directive, including its provisions concerning criminal offences, will be implemented in a timely, consistent and effective manner and will, together with the EU strategy, lead to improved cooperation cross the Union. The further legal framework would enable Member States’ actions to have a greater impact not only in terms of law enforcement but also for the protection and assistance provided to victims.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore crucial that the European anti-trafficking coordinator is provided with appropriate tools and means of cooperation, in order to coordinate efforts at national and EU level. Existing data show that women and girls represent the majority of trafficked people, and we should take into account the root causes of such phenomena, particularly when we speak about gender-based discrimination and violence against women. In this respect, transposing and implementing this directive with an open gender perspective is crucially needed. Further efforts in terms of ensuring the establishment of national rapporteurs responsible for gathering gender-separated national statistics and data would be welcome. In terms of prevention and information, gender-sensitive awareness campaigns still remain to be developed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, as rapporteur for the European Parliament on the Victims’ Rights Package, I would like to stress the need to draw up a solid and ambitious legislative framework establishing minimum standards for victims of crimes and facilitating the recognition of protection measures – civil or criminal –across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope the Council will also acknowledge that supporting victims and recognising their rights throughout the Union is essential in order to facilitate the reporting of crimes and effectively combat organised crime networks which abuse thousands of people and deprive them of their fundamental rights, regardless of their nationality and place of residence.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the residence permit restriction continues, nonetheless, to be a major deficiency when it comes to the protection of victims of human trafficking. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tried to make significant representations to our joint debates in this Parliament, to the effect that victims of human trafficking should receive protection in the form of a residence permit. We have not been successful; what we are now left with is a temporary residence permit and a temporary residence permit means that after a court case, for example, you could still be sent back to the place from which you were trafficked, possibly even back to the people who contributed to your being trafficked in the first place. That remains a shortcoming.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am pleased to see, however, that the victim package which is now being negotiated with the Council acknowledges that trafficking victims deserve support, regardless of their legal status, no matter whether they are legal or illegal. That will help victims of human trafficking.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we all agree that human trafficking is an abhorrent crime which grossly violates the human rights of its victims. This is a modern form of slavery, the incidence of which across Europe continues to grow at an alarming pace. In my own region of Northern Ireland there is a huge problem with human trafficking. Criminal gangs use the province as a gateway to traffic people into the mainland United Kingdom, as well as retaining some victims for local illegal activities. The Police Service of Northern Ireland, the PSNI, is engaged in a comprehensive battle against human trafficking, which focuses both on rescuing victims and catching perpetrators. However, the first person who was convicted on a charge of human trafficking in Northern Ireland was only sentenced a few weeks ago. This shows that we still have a long way to go.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the Commissioner’s statements here today. It is important that this issue is not brushed under the carpet. It should remain very much at the top of the agenda in the fight against crime, and I believe the most important tool for fighting this crime is tougher sentencing of the perpetrators of human trafficking.</p>

    <intervention id="4-112-000" speaker_id="96803" name="Zbigniew Ziobro" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the EFD Group">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I am very sorry to say that slavery and human trafficking still continues, 230 years after the abolition of slavery in Europe. Terrible injustice continues to be done, primarily to women, who even today, now, while we are debating in the European Parliament, are being forced, by threats of blackmail, beatings or even – for those who dare to disobey – death, to provide sexual services in the wealthiest countries of the European Union. They are denied human dignity and often the forces of law and order in the individual countries throw up their hands and pretend that the problem does not exist. This is a terrible shame, to put it mildly, and for this reason we should take all necessary steps to enable effective remedial measures to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, this type of behaviour should always be classified as falling within the category of organised crime. Secondly, it should attract sentences that are appropriately severe, more severe than for ordinary criminal activity, as criminals supported by gangs constitute a greater threat, are able to cause more damage and have a feeling of impunity. Thirdly and finally, a system of extended confiscation should be introduced in all European Union Member States in order to remove the motive and raison d’être for organised crime in human trafficking, which is to earn money from the harm done mostly to women, but also to children. All of the above actions, carried out together and in a coordinated manner in individual European Union Member States, and also coordinated by the European institutions involved, could deliver results, but only if they are undertaken multilaterally and only if they are carried out decisively and consistently, an approach that so far has been lacking.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The media are always reporting terrible stories of women from Eastern Europe or from the developing world who are tricked into coming to countries in Western Europe with promises of honest work and then undergo nightmarish experiences, beatings and sometimes death. We must put an end to this and we must protect the victims of these crimes. We must act firmly and resolutely.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, by far and away the most common form of trafficking in human beings obviously concerns women and girls who are exploited for sexual purposes. I will therefore focus on that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Women and girls are lured and enticed into a cruel world of exploitation. Since the demand to buy women exceeds the number of prostitutes in Europe, these women are recruited from other parts of the world to be bought and sold over and over again. This is contemptuous, shameful, colonial and even racist. We need to have the courage to take a decision that will challenge this. Purchasing sex is not acceptable. In my capacity as a man, I say ‘no’ to men’s right to buy women’s bodies. In my capacity as a politician, I say that we must have the courage to take a decision that will truly abolish trafficking in women.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There are obviously many important measures needed, for example we need to increase our support for the victims of human trafficking, strengthen their rights, grant these victims the right to reside in the country in which they are exploited. At the same time, we must always remember that without the demand for women’s bodies there would be no trafficking in women and girls. This means that the real problem lies with the purchasers of sex.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I believe that we will need to go all the way along the chain in order to be able to put a stop to trafficking. In other words, we must also be able to prohibit the purchasing of sex. This has proved to be an effective measure in Norway, Sweden and Iceland. After all, it is not the women involved in prostitution who should be punished; it is the men that we should focus on.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In summary, combating trafficking in human beings in the EU is largely a question of combating trafficking in women and girls. In order to fight this effectively, we need the political courage to combat demand. Such a policy would be significantly more effective than the current focus on biometric identity documents, passenger information and increased border control.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome Commissioner Malmström’s genuine commitment to fighting trafficking, along with all the measures that the Commission has implemented already. Now is the time for all the Member States to do the same and implement fully, swiftly and effectively the directive that was adopted a year ago. But there is more to be done, because the figures are stunning and the stories are heartbreaking. The issue is the millions of women, children and men who live as slaves in our neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a need for a cultural paradigm shift, and the time of impunity has to come to an end. The culture of impunity, of abuse, cheating and oppression, has to be replaced by a culture which criminalises trafficking. All the perpetrators should hear our voice. They will not feel immune anywhere, in any corner of Europe. We have to join forces on this, not only by better training police forces and taking into account children’s and women’s special needs as well as victim protection, but also by adding some prevention. We need to do more than just persecute; we must also really improve cooperation and have stronger sanctions. This may be a challenge for a criminal system, but we need to see adults and children freed and perpetrators in prison.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the words of the Council and Ms Malmström. I think that today we must at long last talk about a proper European strategy on fighting trafficking, on prevention and on protecting victims.</p>
      <p sl="it">I attach huge significance to the role of the European coordinator, whose staff should, I think, be beefed up. We also need strong direction from the Commission so that all the Member States create equivalent organisations that will work with the national rapporteurs through ongoing consultations, with non-governmental organisations – which are often the most involved in this area – and closely with the police, the magistracy and with the cyber police on offences committed online.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also important to compare the measures against customers and on discouraging demand in the various countries. This will allow us to move forward and connect the measures on children in a more holistic way as we implement this directive and the one on Internet child pornography.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that training legal professionals is of central importance, as is legislative consistency. In this vein I would note the appalling situation of those in Italy who from 1998 had the humanitarian residence permit while now illegal immigration has been made a crime. I hope the current government will change this, because it is making it impossible to use the humanitarian residence permit for women who are victims of trafficking.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, although slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century, there are still many children, and some women and men, who fall victim to human trafficking in Europe every day. We are talking about domestic slaves, prostitutes, beggars and clandestine workers who live through a genuine ordeal of physical violence, humiliation and, at every stage of this hell, anger. Moreover, in nearly 40% of cases this phenomenon involves children. Totally powerless, these people are taken away, held against their will, beaten, subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment, and deprived of their rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union and its Member States have a historic responsibility, as you have reminded us, Commissioner, and we must act together to face up to this criminal activity which flouts the whole spectrum of human rights, particularly those of women. Above all, though, it is of course up to the Union to protect children, the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In relation to this cooperation, Commissioner, although the directive does of course represent an advance and a step forward, it is your task to exert strict supervision of the Member States’ responsibilities through specific and tangible measures, so that we can eliminate this veritable cancer which contravenes the foundations of our democratic societies and the values that have been cemented by European integration.</p>

Unfortunately, however, the fact remains that Member States are still making too little use of the opportunities offered by this directive and, what is more, they still are not doing enough to address prostitution, in particular.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We know that 80% of the women and girls being trafficked end up in prostitution, mainly due to a combination of deception, false promises and corruption. Then they get trapped in the underworld. We must try to get them out, Madam President because, unfortunately, this crime has not yet been taken seriously enough. As a result, European projects intended to warn women and girls or offer them support have hardly got off the ground. We really have to significantly improve cooperation between police authorities, particularly between those in Western and in Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should not conceal this crime out of shame and we have to make use of the directive. I call on the Member States to do that and I support the European Commissioner in doing that.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the trafficking directive the European Union has taken an essential step forward in terms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the EU Member States for the purposes of fighting all new forms of slavery.</p>
      <p sl="it">The directive sets out common rules on the definition of a crime and the level of punishment and ensures greater protection for victims and especially children, whom I think are perhaps the most vulnerable category, face greater risks and therefore deserve to be protected by making punishments harsher, including for crimes committed on the web.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we know, the directive is due to be transposed in 2013, so there is still a year to go. I would, however, like to put a few questions and ask what stage the Member States are at, how cross-border police cooperation is going, what figures have been collected on the subject, and also get some news on the anticipated awareness campaign.</p>
      <p sl="it">Why am I asking these questions? Because I believe that the Commission ought to monitor the situation in the Member States in some way and support them somehow in the proper and effective transposition of the directive. The reason for this is that the directive is definitely a cutting-edge piece of legislation that we should be proud of, but my worry is that the Member States might be a bit late in reaching the objective or anyway come across problems in implementing it. Accordingly, I think we should be following this process carefully to get the best possible result from our work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, human trafficking is without doubt a heinous crime, but it is also a crime of transnational proportions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Eradicating it requires international cooperation between Member States and third countries, with a pre-eminent role for the EU institutions. We must overcome the exploitation inherent in prostitution, illegal labour and micro-criminality. However, talking about human trafficking without talking about organised crime would be to take a partial approach to such a worrying phenomenon, since human trafficking is very often controlled by organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the last few days we saw the establishment of the Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering (CRIM), of which I am the rapporteur. One of our guiding principles and political priorities will no doubt be to make the very most of our work so as to achieve greater collaboration and cooperation with third countries, because we think that regular and legal migration should be encouraged, while illegal migration should be countered strongly and – if we can manage it – eradicated.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need bilateral agreements between the EU and individual third countries on regulating migratory flows, protecting basic freedoms through strong guarantees, and the involvement of Europol and Frontex in particular. All of which must be done in the pursuit of two principles – solidarity and responsibility – without which there is no way there will be any progress.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is also the overarching direction that we will be giving to the CRIM Committee, and the fact that a directive shortly to be transposed in all the Member States is an essential tool in the fight against human trafficking tells us just how much difference a strong European approach could make to this worrying and ongoing phenomenon.</p>

Trafficking in human beings, whether in the form of sexual exploitation, forced labour, slavery or even in the form of illegal harvesting of organs is, unfortunately, a hidden and very serious form of crime. I believe that special attention needs to be paid to elaborating and implementing prevention programmes aimed at children and young people from risk groups. A comprehensive solution for this broad issue of human trafficking must logically also include a comprehensive programme for the return and integration of trafficked persons.

UEFA suggests large football events are irrelevant when it comes to trafficking, but it wishes to remain vigilant. I am not convinced. Mega-brothels opened in host cities in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, and already strip clubs are opening near the football stadiums in Kiev. Where there is a spike in the demand for sex workers there will also be a spike in the demand for the number of women trafficked.</p>

For a long time, it was considered an isolated episode, but it is increasing in recent years as a global problem from which no Member State is immune; for example, Spain is one of the world’s main destinations for people trafficking.

When this subject was discussed in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs about two years ago, I asked the representative from Europol whether any population groups were prominent among the traffickers and the trafficked. He answered without any qualification: the answer to both questions is the Roma. We need to examine the significance of that answer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, criminal sexual exploitation of girls does not always involve crossing international frontiers. The grooming of under-age girls for prostitution by Asian men in the United Kingdom was first brought to public attention by our chairman. The authorities responded by prosecuting him for alleged incitement. It was only when he was acquitted that the authorities were forced to start prosecuting those responsible for the grooming.

An organisation that campaigns for ethnic minorities has recently stated that ‘Northern Ireland has the fastest growing sex industry in any part of the UK’, with victims originating from Ghana, Zimbabwe, China and Slovakia. This statement, coupled with the fact that the first conviction for human trafficking violations in Northern Ireland took place only in February of this year, highlights the urgent need to tackle this problem head on and, in doing so, help some of the most vulnerable in society.

Member States are to introduce the directive into national legislation by 6 April 2013. It is vital to have an action plan as regards combating human trafficking during the upcoming Euro 2012 championship. The EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator should contribute to Commission reports on progress in combating human trafficking, reports that are to be presented to the Council and the European Parliament every two years.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are all aware that the current financial crisis has had an adverse impact on the macroeconomic stability of many Member States and has thus made it difficult to access finance. Whilst I understand that this lack of readily-available finance is making it difficult for many projects under the cohesion policy to continue, it can be argued that having this additional instrument alone, as proposed in the report, may not be entirely effective in addressing this difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although this instrument does address the immediate problem of making funds available for investment, it does not tackle the underlying issue of why some projects are not as successful as they should be. The issue of how the project is being implemented has been entirely overlooked, and solely addressing the financial issues that Member States face will not guarantee the success of the projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">A clear vision, a clear programme for implementation, and specific measurable outcomes which generate economic returns for the Member State in question need to be ensured, as well as full accountability and transparency on risk-sharing.

Naturally we would wish to support measures which would have a meaningful and long-term impact in terms of increasing the competitiveness of their economies through targeted structural reforms to sclerotic labour markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal, whilst well meaning, does not address the underlining economic and financial difficulties in these countries and could possibly make the situation worse. In this period of austerity, taxpayers’ money must be well spent and we must seek to contribute to the employment and growth which will drive the EU out of crisis. Yet this top-down proposal has received only a lukewarm reception in those very Member States it seeks to support. Moreover, it is openly doubted whether some of the proposed projects to benefit from this scheme would pass the necessary EIB due diligence requirements before the risk-sharing instruments could be created.

Almost every day brings media reports and information from financial institutions showing that, despite often optimistic data, we are nevertheless still a long way from overcoming the crisis. For this reason I supported this proposal even though I have certain doubts about it. My doubts stem from the fact that I believe that the economy should be separate from ideology. Thinking about the economy should be free from ideology, but this should work both ways. In the same way that I am unhappy when supporters of the euro suggest that the euro is not a currency but in some way a divine being, I am also unhappy with the views of opponents of the euro.

      <p sl="it">To alleviate those problems and speed up the implementation of the operational programmes and projects, as well as to strengthen the economic recovery, I think it is appropriate that the managing authorities of the Member States which have benefitted from financial assistance according to one of the financial assistance mechanisms provided may contribute some of the resources from operational programmes to the establishment of risk-sharing instruments providing loans or guarantees in support of projects and operations foreseen under an operational programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is our duty to enhance the synergies between the loan programmes and Union funds in those Member States which are under Union or International Monetary Fund assistance.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, cofinancing of projects seeking support from the Structural Funds should increase the efficiency of the use of European money. A private bank or other company that invests its own money in a project will not only want its money back, but will also want to see a profit. They therefore carefully consider the profitability of each project, thereby reducing the risk of wasting European taxpayers’ money. I understand that the Commission is looking for a way to continue funding structural projects even in the current difficult situation. However, the mechanism that it proposes undermines the push to obtain the effectiveness of the expended funds. If the EU pays a large part of the investment, whilst also providing a guarantee of business risk, nothing will prevent banks and private companies from entering into senseless projects. They will not lose their money. This is precisely the path to irresponsible spending, the effects of which we can see today in every EU Member State.</p>

      <p sl="de">Those who voted against this agreement are leaving both the citizens and the air carriers in a fog of legal uncertainty. It would be entirely wrong to believe that, without the agreement, no data of any kind would be transferred any more. All we can do is determine the framework of the data protection standard, and without the agreement this standard would have been considerably lower. Therefore, as I have already said, I voted in favour of this agreement with a clear conscience.</p>

To be frank, there is no way that I can disagree with the previous speaker, my colleague Mr Hannan, that this is a clear example of the anti-Americanism that exists in certain circles in this Chamber. I believe that Europe should cooperate with the USA – the United States is our natural partner in so many areas – but in particular it should cooperate with the USA in areas relating to the tragic battle currently under way against our civilisation, where terrorists wish to destroy the very foundations on which our Union – and the USA – are built.

I understand the need to have certain instruments for this, but this agreement – over which I have been lobbied even by people from the US embassy in my own country – is no such instrument.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Leaving all the legal manoeuvres aside, the fact remains that this agreement allows the US side to download personal data on European citizens, and this sensitive data will then be available in the US without any real control over what happens to it thereafter. The data may include your home address, mobile telephone number, flight information, email, credit card or account numbers and also details of ethnicity or nationality.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The justification that the agreement is good because the bilateral agreements of Member States are worse is bizarre. The justification that the agreement is good because otherwise the US will force European airlines to provide the data themselves is appalling.

I see a problem, first of all, in the broadly defined purpose of Passenger Name Records. For example, there is no adequate definition of terrorism in the text of the Agreement.

With respect to personal data, it is good that the European Parliament has consistently guarded the freedom of EU citizens. The fight against international terrorism and organised crime cannot lead to a situation where everyone becomes suspicious of everyone else. Prevention is important, but equally important is the protection of civil rights. I supported the report because, as the lives of millions of people are at risk, prevention is more important than repression. Nothing can return life to the victims of the terrorist attacks on New York’s Twin Towers and many others, but we can prevent similar acts of violence by monitoring suspects and sharing information about them. However, we must scrupulously see to it that information about private citizens is used only under strictly defined conditions and that its use is monitored and monitorable. Otherwise freedom and democracy replaced by dictatorship, which is exactly what the terrorists want, will come to fruition.</p>

In addition, it is mentioned that the passengers concerned have the chance to delete some of the information. I should also stress that the principles of proportionality and reciprocity have been included. This means that the US authorities are obliged to transfer data relevant to European authorities.

It could, furthermore, have been adjusted by the Council to ensure that it did not step on their sovereign rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, tax harmonisation is really a euphemism for higher tax. I mean, hands up anybody who thinks that tax harmonisation means that it is going to be harmonised downwards. Tax harmonisation removes the external competition which is the usual curb on a government wanting to raise more money. It is bizarre that this becomes our solution to every problem. We are in the mess we are in because the government was spending too much and we will not get out of this mess by raising even more money, transferring even more resources from the private sector into the public.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the reality is that the reason we want tax harmonisation is because the EU wants to give itself a dedicated revenue stream so that it does not need to come cap in hand and beg from the Member States. Behind all this talk about spending money at Brussels level (so you do not have to spend it at national level) is the need to keep fuelling the bureaucracy that has grown up at the top of the EU. That of course is what is going to choke the system; it is going to bring us down as it has brought down every over-centralised and over-taxed imperium in the past. Generations from now, when archaeologists are looking for the last documents from our era, I suspect that the most recent one they are going to find is some tax demand from some Brussels official.</p>

      <p sl="it">Harmonising methods of calculating taxable profits is therefore necessary to ensure that businesses operating in the 27 Member States are subject to the same regulations, regardless of the Member State where they are taxed.

A mandatory system might also lead to higher costs and thus less competitiveness on the European market, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises. The consolidated tax base system should therefore be voluntary and sufficiently advantageous that the greatest possible number of businesses choose to join it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, immediately before the vote today a friend in the EPP challenged me to say something positive about the economy in Europe. He said he was sick and tired of my explanations of vote always focusing on what we were doing wrong. So let me have a go.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a number of positive ways that you can jolt economies into growth. You can cut tax, you can deregulate, you can – paradoxically – make it easier to fire people so that you encourage employers to hire people in the knowledge that they will not be lumbered with employees in the hard times. One thing that always boosts economic growth, in every country and in every age, is cheaper energy. It worked in the Industrial Revolution, it worked in the oil boom. It always causes factory prices to fall; it causes an export boom and it causes people to be able to buy things – with less energy put into it, if you like.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why it would be crazy for us, at a time like this, when we are struggling to grow our economies, to burden ourselves with fuel taxes which will depreciate the one thing which is always, literally and figuratively, the fuel of growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here is the good news: here is the upbeat ending. Just as the US has now started to nose out of its decline because of this massive increase in shale gas deposits, so we have the same opportunities in Europe. We have 120 years of gas supplies under the soil and seas of the United Kingdom alone. Energy crisis? What energy crisis?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the energy sources that we use for mobility in Europe are going to change over the coming decades. However, achieving that objective is incompatible with penalising the use of petrol for automotive purposes. This was the point of my vote in the vote on the directive on the taxation of energy products and electricity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thanks to European investment in research and development, diesel engines today consume 30% less and cause between 20 and 25% less pollution than their petrol counterparts. Europe is a world leader in diesel technology. Penalising diesel is, therefore, a contradiction of 2020 strategy. It would aggravate the crisis, impact negatively on employment in European industry and take away resources for the research, development and innovation that electric mobility needs. In short, damage that we have avoided with today’s vote.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also supported subsidies for professional use of diesel, both for transport and in the primary sector, in order to preserve employment in these sectors and avoid inflation.</p>

They are very unhappy to find themselves paying to subsidise renewables without any real public debate: no acceptance of the concept or the financial hardship behind it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do, however, believe that it is time for a fundamental review of taxation on energy products and particularly electricity: not a review which says the EU should take more interest but one that would end up with the view that we should take far less interest from here.</p>
      <p sl="en">This particular report ranges across a number of areas too numerous to talk about here, but I would just like to mention one: harmonised car purchase tax and harmonised CO2 emission taxes.

The successful upshot of this has been to tone down a fundamentally flawed proposal which has been tabled by the European Commission at the moment. I believe that this automatic price indexing which has been successfully avoided and taxation based on CO2 emissions and the product’s energy content were fundamentally flawed, were introducing a certain amount of red tape and were leading to price rises, which definitely goes to show that there is a basic lack of a clear-cut vision on economic reform and recovery.

      <p sl="pl">Our prize for being European is a tax that will further increase the already astronomical fuel and electricity prices. This, apparently, will create jobs.

      <p sl="en">Taxation is clearly a sovereign matter for each Member State, and efforts to transfer this power to the EU as a Community competence contravene the EU Treaties and will both hamper the competitive free market and play into the hands of increasing numbers of critics who claim that the EU is determined to build a federal superstate without acquiring first any consent from the people of the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, inside this Chamber, the last report, this report, and the next report are all talking about taxation under various guises of how we can raise taxation or harmonise it, whereas outside, in the real world, people are worried about rising costs and about job creation. They want more jobs to be created; they want people to get back to work. One of the most social things that Europe and politicians could do across Member States is create jobs for people.</p>
      <p sl="en">What do we do instead? We talk about taxation and about increasing taxation. We know that when you increase taxation on energy products, those costs are not only passed on to companies – which means they have less money to employ more people – but those companies then pass it on to consumers, who then find it more difficult to struggle with their weekly and monthly household bills.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now is the time to take stock of where we are. Giving money to governments, who spent it very badly in the first place and overtaxed us, caused the problems we are now facing. Let us reduce the rates of taxation, allow jobs to be created and get citizens in European countries back to work.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is how to transform a good idea can into a punishment for employees and their families. How can one oppose the idea of reducing emissions of the fatal gas CO2 ? How can one be against the desire to control energy consumption and the elimination of wastefulness? Why then, in that case, should only the smallest be targeted?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Large sectors such as air transport, sea transport, agriculture and road transport will benefit from exemptions until 2023. Thus, a large transport company will benefit from exemptions while the lorry driver it employs will pay full price. Thus, a large agricultural company will benefit from exemptions while an agricultural employee with a small salary will pay full price. Small people such as these have no alternative, because for years we have shown them that diesel is the least expensive fuel and they are prisoners of their cars because they do not have the means to change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, if money needed to be found, I can think of several ways, which I will outline to you briefly. We could have taken it out of the profits of the large oil companies, taken it out of the wastage of public money, taken it out of the profits of the large car companies, and also – why not? – taken it out of the profits of credit agencies which lend money to buy cars.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted against the joint motion for a resolution put forward by the S&amp;D Group on concrete ways to combat tax fraud and tax evasion. There are many problems with this report, starting with the simple fact that taxation is primarily a Member State prerogative. But I was particularly concerned by the identical treatment given to tax evasion and tax avoidance. The report calls for measures to be taken against both at EU level. Not differentiating between the two seems nonsensical and smacks of the politics of envy, given that one is a wilful criminal breaking of the law and the other is perfectly legal.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I would agree that tax fraud and tax evasion should be curtailed, my group does not agree with the premise that tax avoidance within the law is detrimental to tax collection. Another worrying aspect of the report is its consideration that the implementation of country-by-country reporting requirements for cross-border companies in all sectors is essential. I believe that such requirements will be too onerous a burden if applied to all EU companies in all sectors, as the report seems to propose. I would instead back a sector-specific approach, which is a far more reasonable way of doing things.</p>

      <p sl="en">The way to maximise revenue from taxation is through lower, flatter and simpler tax rates. It is all very well to say, as some have in this Chamber, that we need to find ways of getting these rich tax evaders to pay their share, but the ultimate forms of tax evasion – or rather tax avoidance – that they practice are emigration and early retirement. The sad truth is that the rich do not have enough money to do all the things that modern governments want.</p>
      <p sl="en">So when taxes on the rich are introduced, they very quickly become generalised through the population. It works every time. It worked when Ronald Reagan cut the top rates and it worked when Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson did so. If you lower the rates of tax, you maximise the revenue and you also get the top decile in society to pay a much higher proportion.</p>
      <p sl="en">People say, ‘oh, that’s only because they’re earning more’. Well yes, that is the idea – and they are thereby generating more revenue for the government to spend on things that the rest of us use.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for catching me by surprise, and I thank Mr Kamiński for not being here to allow me to speak earlier. What is very interesting about this whole debate about tax – we have spent the last three reports talking about taxation – is that there are two different philosophies on taxation. If you are on the Left, you believe that the government has first recourse to your money. You earn your money, but the government itself decides how much to give to you while it takes the money. If you are on the conservative Right – as we are – you believe that individuals should be allowed to keep as much of their money as possible in their pocket, and that governments should really take only what is necessary for government and state services. But what do we see? In proposal after proposal, we see an increase and an attack on people who are trying to maximise the amount of their income that they can spend on their families and themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other thing we see in this place is the attack on so-called tax havens. When countries set themselves up to be tax-neutral – not to double and triple tax in order to generate revenue and to attract foreign investment – immediately that is a tax haven and is condemned. And when developing countries do it, what do we do? We try to condemn them, to make sure that they go back to poverty so that they can rely on our aid rather than trying to create wealth through tax competition. What a skewed world we are living in here in the European Parliament. It is time to ensure that tax competition is healthy in order to create jobs and attract investment.</p>

In order for the EU-CAR VPA – concluded 28 November 2011 – to come into force, it must first be adopted by the European Parliament. I am voting for this recommendation, because I consider it crucial that there be legislation promoting sustainability in the forestry sector and preventing indiscriminate logging. Moreover, this VPA will make a sustainable contribution to the CAR’s overall development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The objectives of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Central African Republic (CAR) on forest law enforcement, governance and trade involve combating the problem of illegal logging by helping to improve regulation, governance and the implementation of legislation in the CAR’s forestry sector. Illegal logging contributes to destroying and degrading ecosystems that are very important, both from a functional point of view and in terms of the natural resources that they house. However, a correct approach to the causes of the problem needs to acknowledge that it cannot be separated from the enormous weaknesses in the economies of these countries or the high poverty levels of their peoples, and that this activity is sometimes many families’ only source of income.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur herself mentions that many indigenous communities living in the CAR’s tropical forests depend on using forest resources. The result is that it will only be possible to put a stop to illegal or unsustainable logging if the terrible social and economic situation in countries like the CAR is properly tackled and resolved; if the economic model based heavily on extracting and exporting a small number of raw materials to industrialised countries is reversed.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The EU’s 2003 Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) provided for the establishment of partnerships with timber-producing and exporting countries to ensure that only legally harvested timber is traded and to promote sound forest governance. The trade agreement with the Central African Republic, signed in November 2011, is the fourth such Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) the EU has negotiated with an African country. It provides an instrument for addressing illegal logging, for helping to improve regulation, governance and law enforcement in the country’s forestry sector and for strengthening market opportunities for Central African timber products in Europe. The VPA can be expected to contribute positively to overall development and growth in the Central African Republic, including by safeguarding income generated by timber exports to the EU and other international markets. In future, tax revenues from industrial forest exploitation should also increasingly profit the local economy and communities in the Central African Republic. I believe that Parliament should give its consent to this agreement. At the same time both the CAR Government and the European Commission will need to devote sufficient attention to effective and timely VPA enforcement, including capacity building, participation of local communities, safeguards for indigenous populations and general awareness-raising on this VPA among the various stakeholders.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The African continent is a very poor region. Many people there suffer from poverty, whilst hunger and disease can be seen at every step. However, Africa is also a region with very rich natural resources and rational management of these resources could improve the situation of its population. In the Central African Republic, 31% of the land is covered by tropical forests. People living in that country are largely dependent on those forests and forestry is the principal source of employment in the private sector. I believe that the most important issues in the area of forestry should be subject to regulation and products from wood that enter European Union markets should come from legitimate sources. Proper monitoring of the procedure for bringing goods onto the market is essential. It is also worth looking at the national market, which was excluded from this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Today, the European Parliament gave its agreement to the conclusion of a partnership agreement with the Central African Republic. This Voluntary Partnership Agreement obliges the partner to create a legal framework, and, in particular, permits for timber and derived products that may be exported to EU markets and to establish a monitoring system and independent audits.</p>
      <p sl="en">As much as 60% of Central African timber is exported to the EU. As this sector is one of the principal sources of income for this country, exploitation of forestry resources leads to environmental damage. The main causes of this are a lack of means to enforce the law as well as ineffective monitoring, which leads to illegal logging. It should also be remembered that over 3 million hectares of forests in the Central African Republic are covered by commercial concessions, mainly to European companies. These companies must have permits for logging, thus a proper legal environment is vital both for these companies and for growth in trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to ensure sustainable forestry management and to avoid degradation of the forests, the Central African Republic has undertaken, as part of the agreement, to trade only in legitimate forestry products. I think it is a very important development that this agreement, together with other legal measures, such as the EU Timber Regulation which is to come into force in 2013, will help reduce illegal logging. However, effective implementation of the regulation will be essential.</p>

      <p sl="de">Tropical and rainforest timber from the Central African Republic is a valuable resource. In order to control trade in this timber and to curb illegal felling, the EU has already concluded a Voluntary Partnership Agreement with a handful of African states, including Ghana, Congo and Cameroon. Now, an agreement of this kind is to be concluded with the Central African Republic. Some definite advantages of the agreement are the traceability of the timber, legal verification and the licensing of timber and timber products. Around 60% of the Central African Republic’s timber is exported to Europe. The report received my vote because I agree with the rapporteur that the Voluntary Partnership Agreement will have a positive impact on forest management in Central Africa.

The VPA with the Central African Republic (CAR) falls somewhat short on both, especially since the CAR also maintains a REDD process (the UN programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries); hence the implementation of the VPA needs to be especially carefully monitored.</p>

Furthermore, in the VPA process special attention has been given to the legality assurance system, independent auditing, the role of civil society in the monitoring of the agreement, as well as transparency and information exchange. The EU-Liberia VPA has therefore been developed in a transparent manner with most participants actively involved in the process so far, including all key forest stakeholders.</p>

      <p sl="it">From the point of view of building a more robust legal framework, a widespread system of opportunities (starting with the communities living in the areas of production), and greater integration of Liberia into international markets, which is a guarantee of political stability, the agreement undoubtedly represents an important and positive contribution.

      <p sl="pt">It should be noted that approximately 45% of the country is covered by forest. Therefore, this Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the EU enables Liberia to respond simultaneously to the problems associated with logging and illegal trade, to improve forest sustainability and to expand EU market opportunities for timber. I also consider it positive that the VPA with Liberia has involved a multilateral approach, with a high rate of participation by civil society, industry and forest-area communities, and with particular attention being paid to the new system for verifying legality, to independent audits, to the transparency of the process, to information exchanges and to creating a joint implementation committee which will oversee the agreement.</p>

Like other FLEGT agreements, it is intended to solve the illegal logging problem, to help improve regulation, governance and law enforcement in these two countries’ forestry sectors, and to strengthen market opportunities for timber products in Europe. These VPAs are intended to provide third countries with national-level regulations for implementing systems for verifying conformity and traceability throughout the supply chain, as well as with logging rules and controls on export shipments. This will guarantee timber products originating in Liberia favourable access to the EU.</p>

Like other African countries, Liberia is extremely poor. For this reason, the most important thing is to promote these countries’ development by supporting their economic diversification and by reversing an economic model based on the heavy dependence of exploiting and exporting a select number of raw materials to industrialised countries, which fosters neo-colonial relationships of dependence and subjugation, which lead to the plundering of resources.</p>

Partner countries are committed to trade only in verified legal timber products into the EU. They are also developing their own systems to verify the legality of their timber exports to the EU. The agreement with Liberia, signed in July 2011, was the sixth such agreement to be negotiated. As with the previous VPAs, it is hoped that the one with Liberia will help improve governance and law enforcement in the country’s forestry sector.

Bilateral Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with the main wood-producing countries are the cornerstone of the EU Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) to halt illegal logging.

In order to verify the legality of timber exports, the VPA establishes the framework, institutions and systems of a licensing scheme and sets out supply chain controls. It also devises a framework for monitoring implementation. Liberia is an important partner. 45 per cent of the country is covered with forest and is home to half of West Africa’s remaining rain forests. During the civil war (1997-2003), timber revenues were used to fuel the conflict, which in turn led to UN sanctions against the Liberian timber trade. In 2006, Liberia reformed the forestry sector.

      <p sl="it">The EU institutions must make a commitment to analyse the developments of events during the crisis and quickly adopt effective measures to deal with the new situations, especially in cases in which important stabilisation operations have been put at risk by the change in the general framework, and especially when the private funding necessary for investments in recovery is no longer available.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union is currently facing a persistent economic and financial crisis which is affecting not only the macro-economic stability of many Member States, but also their access to finance across the whole Union. This measure is intended to find a solution to the serious problems faced by some Member States in raising the private funding needed to implement infrastructure and productive investment projects which can only be part-financed by public funds. The Commission’s proposal concerns only revenue-generating projects, since the investment costs covered by revenues are not eligible for EU cofinancing. In the Member States hardest hit by the financial and economic crisis, a number of strategic projects which have been selected for cofinancing under cohesion policy programmes are at risk of not being implemented because private sector investors and banks either lack the liquidity to lend to projects and project promoters, or are no longer willing to bear the investment risks in the current climate.</p>

What concerns me is the fact that the Commission has had to resort to the creation of such a facility to underwrite loans from the private sector due to the ongoing crisis in the Eurozone. This is yet another example of the Commission seeking to equip themselves with a legal tool to fight a particular battle, while the war still rages because the bigger issues are not being addressed. As a result the risk sharing instrument enables the Commission to blindly pursue European ideals through regional funding that may or may not reflect the best interests of the member states concerned, while failing to address the endemic ideological problems that are the authors of the ongoing fiscal crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report proposes to help the Member States most affected by the financial crisis and unable to guarantee the necessary private funding for completing revenue-generating infrastructures. Private partners are not in a position to invest due to liquidity problems and the difficulties in accessing loans, so part of individual Member States’ financial allocations to the Commission is to be transferred in order to create a fund to cover the risks linked to the loans. This means that, in order to allow the completion of ongoing works, some Member States will in fact deprive themselves of part of their allocated funds. As far as we are concerned, while we support the instrument, we should have preferred intervention of a more structural nature for dealing with the endemic lack of liquidity in many Member States, in order to improve expenditure performance and avoid having to resort to drastic measures that could reduce resources. In this regard we are convinced that these difficulties could be overcome by introducing a derogation from the Stability and Growth Pact, in order to allow the national cofinancing of projects considered particularly important for economic recovery and job creation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The protracted economic and financial crisis calls into question the macroeconomic stability of certain countries.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The budgetary and debt crises of the Member States concerned have resulted in extreme situations where these countries are unable to implement key projects in the framework of cohesion and structural policy. The banking sector has been showing little willingness to provide financing, while private investors are also unavailable.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The severely affected countries are unable to generate growth, and in some of them investments have stopped due to a lack of private sector cofinancing.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The private sector definitely needs to be involved in the implementation of infrastructure projects. Europe needs growth, which can only be achieved if we ensure the absorption of the resources of the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund in the form of risk-sharing instruments in the various regions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Synergies between the funds must be enhanced, as this is the only way to ensure their efficient utilisation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The rules on cofinancing and state aid are extremely rigid. Raising the percentage of cofinancing to 95% offered some measure of help, but it is still not sufficient.

The goal is to concentrate this capital in the European Investment Bank (EIB) to cover losses – foreseen and unforeseen – from loans and guarantees.</p>
      <p sl="pt">So-called risk sharing is being established between the EIB and other national or international financial institutions, public or private, which will issue loans to projects’ investors and to banks, with a view to providing private cofinancing for projects implemented with contributions from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. As we said during the debate, there are other ways of overcoming the severe limitations on private investment. These ways involve, not reducing – in practice – the overall financial package for these countries, but rather increasing it. This is, therefore, yet another uniquely European exercise in ‘solidarity’. Moreover, the example given by the rapporteur of the type of projects to be funded is enlightening: finance for building toll motorways, to be operated by private companies.</p>

Although important measures to offset the negative impact of the crisis have already been taken, it continues to have a serious impact on the real economy, the labour market and citizens. A Member State which is in difficulties, or is threatened with difficulties because of exceptional circumstances beyond its control, may receive financial assistance from the European Union. Following the two previous proposals for amending the regulation brought forward in response to the current economic and financial crisis, the Commission proposes a third amendment that lays down provisions for the creation of a risk-sharing instrument. According to the proposal that has been presented, in order to implement the risk-sharing instrument, it would be permitted to transfer part of the financial allocations available to these Member States that are experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability back to the Commission. At the same time, the aim is to ensure the continued implementation of the programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund in the context of the economic recovery of the Member States under financial assistance.

      <p sl="hu">The European Union is currently facing a lasting economic and financial crisis, which affects not only the macroeconomic stability of several Member States, but also access to financing throughout the EU. This also jeopardises the implementation of cohesion policy programmes, as the liquidity problems of financial institutions limit the amounts of funding available to state and private sector participants involved in implementing the projects concerned. I agree with the rapporteur of the report that the lack of liquidity faced by the financial sector is not limited to the countries that have received financial assistance from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism or the Balance of Payments mechanism. This is why we are seeing that managers of infrastructure and productive investments in all Member States consider the reduction of their sources of finance as one of their primary problems. I believe that the possibility of extending the risk-sharing mechanisms to be created to all Member States will increase investment in growth and job creation throughout the EU through the use of Structural and Cohesion funds that could otherwise remain unabsorbed by the end of the current programming period.

Unfortunately, this is not the chosen solution. The Commission intends to continue to fund projects which should have been funded through its cohesion policy through lending and through the continued debt of the states and regions in the greatest difficulty.

The agreement essentially relies on blind confidence in the American authorities. Specifically, the data for the ‘named passengers’ will be stored for 15 years, and anonymised for an indeterminate period of time, without the possibility of real judicial redress outside United States territory. In other words, it is a clear denial of individual freedoms and quite simply legal madness. Such processing of passenger data is simply unacceptable, and is incompatible with the principles of proportionality and purpose, as personal and commercial data for an indeterminate number of individuals who are unsuspicious are processed for security purposes, in the fight against terrorism.

All the more so as it appears to be difficult to gauge how effective the control and data storage measures are in the face of terrorist acts which are frequently not very sophisticated. Furthermore, while these data should strictly only be used as part of the fight against terrorism, in reality the purposes for which they can be used are very broad and very ill-defined. The retention period, the need for anonymisation and deletion, as well as the right of access, correction and deletion for the citizens concerned, are also important reasons for my rejection of this agreement. As Ms Guillaume pointed out, this is an unfortunate situation because this agreement should, on the contrary, have provided the opportunity to ensure that high data protection standards prevail, as behoves the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">The agreements entered into between the European Union and the United States of America on transfers of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data are a considerable improvement on those negotiated in 2007. They include tighter regulations in order to protect passenger privacy, and allow data transfer solely for the purpose of combating terrorism and serious transnational crimes. Despite the fact that I agree with some of the concerns voiced by the rapporteur Ms in’t Veld, I feel her approach is counter-productive. Expressing a negative opinion in order to achieve more stringent regulations would only serve to undo all the Commission’s efforts in achieving this result. According to Commissioner Malmström, in fact, the agreements under examination represent the best possible result, and if Parliament does not approve them, it will not be possible to go back to the negotiating table. Given the importance of data transfer in the fight against terrorism, the individual Member States would therefore be forced to enter into bilateral agreements with the US, and as they would be in a weaker bargaining position, they would be unable to demand such favourable regulations for European citizens. This is why I voted in favour.</p>

However, I believe that the Commission has negotiated the best agreement that is politically possible at the current time - the scope has been narrowed, retention periods reduced and there has been some movement on the 'push/pull' issue. Rejection of this agreement would have done nothing to stop the flow of data to the US. Indeed, it is unlikely that the 27 Member States could produce more satisfactory arrangements through the negotiation of 27 Bilateral arrangements with the US. EU citizens rights are better protected through this agreement and ratification does provide a single clear EU legal framework, with EP oversight, that can be reviewed. I would request that the Commission ensure a rigorous and robust assessment of this PNR agreement and report back to Parliament on this review.</p>

One positive aspect of paramount importance is that PNR data will be made anonymous after six months, as well as the fact that European citizens will have full access to this data. Another guarantee which has been obtained is that any decision made on the basis of analysing this data should not be reached using automated processing, but through human evaluation. At the same time, we must bear in mind that at least two proposals which will also influence the EU agreements on data exchange are currently being debated. This concerns, first of all, the directive on the use of PNR data, as well as the data protection package.

      <p sl="fr">I voted against the agreement on the use and transfer of Passenger Name Records to the United States for two reasons. Firstly, this agreement is an ‘executive agreement’ under US law, which will not be ratified by the Senate and which cannot create rights on the part of anyone. The United States is therefore not bound in any way to apply the ‘guarantees’ for European passengers contained in the agreement if they believe that their national law runs counter to this. Any judicial redress against data misuse that European citizens tried to bring in US courts would, consequently, be compromised in advance. The agreement does not improve the legal situation of European passengers travelling to the United States, given that its status under US law does not enable the creation of new rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, this agreement is merely a European ratification of US practices as regards the transfer of passengers’ personal data. I find, on the whole, that this practice goes too far and I am unable to agree to a text which, in addition to extremely difficult procedures for entry into the United States, subjects passengers travelling in good faith to generalised suspicion. You do not fight terrorism and serious crime by treating in advance every passenger on a transatlantic flight as a guilty party.</p>

That is why the existence of a long-term EU-US agreement on matters relating to the processing and transfer of personal data and the identification of passengers should be welcomed. However, this agreement cannot unduly jeopardise European citizens’ rights. For that reason, the legal requirements of fair, necessary, proportionate and lawful processing of personal information should apply under all circumstances. The present EU-US agreement seeks to achieve a reasonable balance between protecting European citizens’ rights and the necessary security guarantees which ultimately benefit us all. I am therefore voting for the text of this agreement because I believe that, as Commissioner Malmström has pointed out, this is the best possible agreement; the one that best protects the European public.

Since 2007, the European Union has been seeking to negotiate with the EU an agreement on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security. However, holding passenger details on file and the request for information of a personal nature – health, financial situation, etc. – has been arousing enormous concern about violations of data-protection rules. The conclusion of an EU-US agreement on the use and transfer of PNRs is the best solution, rather than concluding bilateral agreements. This proposal represents the US moving significantly towards the positions argued by the EU. However, this agreement does not guarantee the European public more protection. It is noteworthy that a ‘push’ as opposed to ‘pull’ system is allowed. This means there is no guarantee that there would be no breaking into our computers and databases.

However, as a number of voices have warned, information on political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership, as well as other information relating to a people’s health and sexual orientation will also be included. This agreement uses the much-vaunted ‘war on terror’ as a pretext for jeopardising the public’s fundamental rights and freedoms, disrespecting basic data-protection rules. This agreement can also be unilaterally amended by the US Department of Homeland Security at any time. The data may be used for non-specified purposes and will be kept for 15 years.

In particular, it continues to be possible for the data to be transferred to third countries at the discretion of the US, and it is also the case that European air passengers are not treated on a par with those from the United States. The PNR agreement is also classed as an executive agreement. That means that it is not submitted to Congress for ratification and therefore it is not actually legally binding for the US. On the other hand, however, the US has access to all data from the booking stage onwards, which is made even worse by the fact that the data centres of all four large, global booking databases are in the United States, which has been able to avail itself of them at will since 2001 by means of administrative orders. The Commission was not able to get its way on a single aspect that is important to Europeans, and it also failed to negotiate an improvement in the legal status of European air passengers. Therefore, the result is an agreement that only brings advantages for the US and its secret services. I therefore voted against this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for the EU-US agreement on the use and transfer of passenger name records to, and from, the United States for a number of reasons. Firstly, the agreement regulates and limits the obligation to provide data under US law, forcing the US to make compromises with the EU; it is far better than the 2007 agreement, than existing bilateral agreements and than no agreement. Secondly, passengers’ personal data constitute an essential instrument for combating terrorism and other types of cross-border crime, such as drug and people trafficking. Thirdly the right to security of passengers and of people in general is no less important than the right to personal data protection; the personal data in question do not include sensitive data and the agreement ensures a satisfactory balance between the right to security and the right to personal data-protection, and I do not therefore consider it incompatible with European law in this regard. Finally, the agreement gives EU and Member State security services access to the US authorities’ data and research findings, thereby aiding European security, since the EU does not have its own system for collecting and processing passengers’ personal data.</p>

The agreement with the United States for the transfer of passenger name records to the Department of Homeland Security is highly questionable from the point of view of data protection. There are no conditions laid down for accessing the data, nor is it possible to check exactly what happens to the data that is transferred. In particular, it is not clear whether the United States will transfer the data to third countries. The data will be permanently stored, and innocent citizens can thus be placed in non-transparent suspect categories. I have serious concerns about the fact that the agreement needs to be brought into line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.

As part of this common effort, the exchange of information, particularly in terms of airlines that operate EU-US flights transferring passenger name records (PNRs), serves the purpose of combating the threat to international peace and security. PNR data can only be processed to prevent, detect, and repress acts of terrorism and serious forms of cross-border crime.

Our role was to strike a balance between these two demands. That is what I think has been achieved. The right to security is fundamental, a cardinal right. Without security about who we are and what we own, what is the point of being able to travel, think, speak, publish or demonstrate? Frankly, the ‘privacy’ hardliners, who merrily throw the baby out with the bathwater, might be better advised to take a look at the control to which we willingly allow ourselves to be subjected on social networks.

Parliament did not accept the terms of the agreement and called on the European Commission to hold additional talks with the USA on those terms and conditions. In the talks, improvements were sought to the implementation of civil rights causing the greatest concern with respect to the protection of privacy. The reformed agreement now before us includes a maximum period of 15 years for the retention of data, and allows EU authorities to verify the implementation of the agreement in the United States.</p>

In voting on the recommendation to adopt the agreement on the transfer of PNR data, and in consideration of the fact that rejecting the recommendation would mean that we would have no agreement in force with the USA, I am absolutely convinced that a contractual arrangement will do more to protect the rights of air passengers than having no agreement in place at all.</p>

The agreement that is to be concluded creates a basis for the disproportionate and unjustified gathering and storage of data. There is also no guarantee that the data will be used only for the purpose of reducing and preventing terrorism and international crimes. Unfortunately the decision adopted today infringes the foundations of democracy, more precisely people’s fundamental rights. This agreement does not guarantee the protection of personal data or individuals’ right to privacy and legal protection. The Commission has failed to improve the 2007 agreement in any way. Profiles continue to be prepared about completely unsuspicious passengers, they are classified into opaque risk categories and their data are stored for 15 years. After that the data are ‘fully anonymised’ instead of being deleted. This causes genuine concern as to whether the agreement is in compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the legal precedents of the European Court of Human Rights and the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany.

While the Commission had initially proposed a voluntary system, we came to the view that this system should become compulsory after a transitional period, and I support this fully.

European Union Member States have different tax bases, which partly constitute trade barriers to growth and employment. The European Union CCCTB framework comprises a full set of rules to consolidate the individual fiscal results of each company or branch, to consolidate those results (profits and losses) and to apportion the consolidated tax base to all relevant Member States if it is positive. It is important that each Member State will apply its own tax rate to the share of the tax base assigned to it. Only the calculation and apportionment of the tax base is being harmonised. Member States themselves will retain the power to set the tax rates. The harmonisation also will not apply to national rules on financial reporting. Taking into account the CCCTB, the aim is to reduce compliance costs for companies in the internal market in the area of taxation by establishing a system for a common base for company taxation so that groups of companies are able to deal with a single tax administration.

      <p sl="cs">I can understand the feelings of entrepreneurs who, thanks to the open single market, are doing business in many EU countries and yet are left wondering how they should tax on individual operating sites under Europe’s varying legislative principles. The complexity of cost and revenue allocation is an onerous burden. Entrepreneurs will thus be able to choose whether to take this more complex route or whether to use the option of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. This also addresses the question of double taxation, which will lead to less tax evasion. Last but not least, it will reduce the administrative burden. At the same time, as a social democrat, I welcome any harmonisation in the common economic area of the EU. I have therefore voted in favour of the motion.</p>

      <p sl="it">I think that differences in the methods for calculating the tax base among Member States bring huge bureaucratic costs and represent one of the main remaining barriers to trade within the European Union. Accordingly, establishing a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) would reduce these costs, with obvious advantages for enterprises operating across various countries. This proposal helps cut red tape and reduce the costs related to tax obligations by establishing a single approach to calculating the base and by adopting the ‘one-stop-shop’ concept, as a result of which enterprises will only have to submit only one statement. It also makes it possible to offset the profits made in one country with the losses incurred in another, thereby eliminating the phenomenon of double taxation. I think this directive could help businesses that operate in a number of countries to grow, especially small and medium-sized enterprises which face proportionally higher costs due to excessive red tape. The proposal therefore helps towards the achievement of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and provides a way to boost growth and employment in the Union.

At a time of crisis like the one we are experiencing, it is important to implement reforms that improve the economy and stimulate growth. Although implementing this proposal for a directive is not obligatory for the Member States, it represents a very important step towards creating a more favourable competition environment for companies and the relaunch of the economy. This, therefore, is a more transparent system that halts double taxation, and demonstrates less bureaucracy – the Member States will apply their taxation via a single access point – and less tax flight. The existence of a revision clause enables the Member States to verify whether the implementation of this directive is positive or negative for a market economy that generates growth and creates jobs.

      <p sl="pt">The proposal is to regulate taxation on the income of companies and groups of companies active in more than one Member State. It puts forward a formula that will determine apportionment of the tax base among the Member States. Value of sales, number of workers, staff costs and value of fixed assets are factors in this formula. It is not accurate because it does not take account of concrete factors, the importance of which may not be negligible. Moreover, considering wage bills or labour costs also has the harmful consequence of disproportionately distributing profits to countries where these are higher. In fact, any companies opting for this system will stop being taxed on their profits and will start being taxed according to the results of applying the designated factors to the group’s profits, which may not – and, the majority of the time, will not – be the same as the company’s real profit. The Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base is optional. However, it cannot be applied to small and medium-sized enterprises, but only to European companies and European cooperatives, which will create a situation that gives multinationals an advantage over domestic companies.</p>

      <p sl="sk">A Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base should tackle some major fiscal impediments to growth in the Single Market. Without common rules on corporate taxation there is often excessive and double taxation (due to the concurrent jurisdiction of national tax systems), a heavy administrative burden on businesses and high costs in order to comply with tax legislation. This situation discourages investment, which is thus contrary to the objectives set in Europe 2020. This situation creates disincentives for investment, which runs counter to the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The proposed common approach would ensure the harmonisation of national tax systems, but not tax rates. Differences between the rates will allow some degree of tax competition to be maintained within the internal market. I firmly believe that fair competition ensures greater transparency and allows Member States to take into account both their competitiveness on the market and their own budgetary needs when setting their tax rates. Since the proposed system is primarily designed to serve the needs of companies that operate across borders, it should be an optional scheme, accompanying the existing national corporate tax systems.</p>

The principal advantages of introducing the CCCTB include: greater fiscal transparency; reduced enforcement costs and red tape, which will improve the prospects for growth of businesses with cross-border operations, and make the European Union more attractive to foreign investors; the expectation that allocation decisions on the internal market will be taken more in the light of social and economic considerations of a tax-neutral nature than they are at present; a reduction in two types of tax problem: tax evasion and fraud on the one hand and double taxation on the other.</p>

A more integrated tax policy would reduce EU bureaucracy and increase transparency in matters of taxation. The great differences in the taxation of corporate income are a significant factor restricting investment in the European Union, causing unfair competition and revenue allocation among Member States. Even countries with extensive tax incentives such as Estonia, where companies do not have to pay income tax on investments, the desired competitive advantage has not been achieved, and this has instead created a situation in which corporations withdraw their profits tax-free and channel them, within their group, to other countries. It is, however, vitally important to have tax incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is altogether justified to make exceptions for them. The fears of some Member States that this directive may in future be used to begin harmonising corporate tax rates are, however, unfounded. I support the proposal to calculate the tax base and divide it into parts (turnover, labour and assets), which is extremely important for the above-mentioned reasons.</p>

Above all, it will ensure greater fiscal transparency, and reduce compliance costs and bureaucracy. I oppose the proposal to set a minimum European rate of corporation tax.

Introducing a common corporate tax base is a key measure for ending tax arbitrage in Europe as well as reducing business costs, and the EP has today fully backed the proposals to this end. If it is to work, the CCCTB has to be binding, and the EP has today underlined this point, calling for a mandatory CCCTB for all large enterprises whilst leaving small and medium-sized enterprises the option to choose to apply the common base if they wish. A common corporate tax base would ensure greater transparency of corporate tax in the EU and reduce the scope for tax evasion, as well as reducing the administrative burden for tax-compliant cross-border firms. The CCCTB must only be the first step for tackling tax evasion and dumping in Europe and must be followed up by a minimum corporate tax rate, both of which together would help end the tax dumping that enables corporations in the EU to avoid up to EUR 100 billion in tax payments.

According to investment barometers, over the next few years, Europe faces the threat of a large-scale departure of industry for areas where production costs are lower. In addition, the longer term change to the age structure in the EU is significantly hampering the successful management of public finances. These causes of the problem pose a special challenge for policymaking.

The CCCTB would also encourage foreign investors to invest in the EU, on account of the cheaper and clearer corporate taxation system.</p>

Let us not forget that tax competition is an important instrument for Member States to attract investments and regulate economic and financial processes, and it is therefore no coincidence that tax policy comes entirely under their remit.

For economies with low, flat tax rates of around 10-12%, the introduction of tax rates of 25%, as proposed by some colleagues in Parliament, would be tantamount to eliminating the potential to attract investments, with unforeseeable economic and social consequences.

      <p sl="lv">In my view, the proposal for a Council directive on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base should not be supported. The right of Member States to set differing corporate income tax rates, as well as to decide what precisely is taxable, is one of the means of ensuring fair competition between EU countries. Member States that have joined the euro area or have pegged their exchange rates to the euro no longer have the opportunity to use monetary instruments as a means of increasing their competitiveness. As a consequence, an advantageous tax regime is almost the only opportunity for new EU Member States to create the conditions for economic growth that is more rapid than in Member States with a large accumulated capital base. Although Parliament’s stance emphasises that the new system will not apply to the level of tax rates, it expresses an unequivocal determination to move towards ever closer tax harmonisation in the EU. Parliament wishes to amend the voluntary principle as regards the introduction of the corporate income tax base which is unequivocally expressed in the European Commission’s proposed directive. Instead, European companies which are by definition ‘transnational’ ‘are considered’ to have opted to apply the system from two years after the date on which the Member States apply the provisions of the new directive. Other companies, with the exception of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), should also apply the directive no later than by the end of the fifth year of its implementation.

      <p sl="pt">The proposal is to regulate taxation on the income of companies and groups of companies active in more than one EU Member State. To this end, it puts forward a fixed formula for apportionment that does not affect the tax base, but rather its apportionment among the Member States. Value of sales, number of workers, staff costs and value of fixed assets are factors in this formula. It is not accurate because it does not take account of concrete factors, the importance of which may not be negligible. Moreover, considering wage bills or labour costs also has the harmful consequence of disproportionately distributing profits to countries where these are higher. In fact, any companies opting for this system will stop being taxed on their profits and will start being taxed according to the results of applying the designated factors to the group’s profits, which may not – and, the majority of the time, will not – be the same as the company’s real profit. The Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base is optional.

The proposal presented by the Commission on the taxation of energy products and electricity really is a significant contribution to the realisation of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy. Under the Commission’s proposal, energy taxes will be divided into tax linked to CO2 emissions and tax based on the energy content of products. This means that a single minimum rate of tax for CO2 emissions (EUR 20/t CO2) will be set for all sectors not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The sectors in question, notably households, the transport sector, small businesses and agriculture, will thus become subject to a carbon charge. Each energy product will be also taxed according to the amount of energy it produces. Although it is estimated that the introduction of a CO2 tax at the rate of EUR 20/t will secure EUR 20 billion in combined tax revenue for the EU countries as of 2020, it is essential to comprehensively assess the impact of this proposal on EU industry and economic growth. In a large number of Member States the adoption of this proposal would lead to a significant increase in the price of diesel, which would have a negative impact on European competitiveness in the technological development of diesel engines and the European automobile industry, which is already facing serious competition from third countries.

It is important to adapt the structure of energy taxation in order to support the aim of a low-carbon, energy-efficient economy and to avoid problems in the internal market. The Commission intends to tax energy on a dual basis, according to both CO2 emissions and energy content.

I am against any EU initiative which seeks to gain fiscal reward from green taxation.

Considering the ongoing struggles in the Eurozone and the competitiveness of rising superpowers such as China and India, the €20billion would be better spent boosting rather than penalising European manufacturing.</p>

Accordingly, I decided to vote in favour of the report on the taxation of energy products, which sets out a series of measures designed to promote energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. I also think that the amendments adopted by Parliament have significantly improved the Commission’s proposal and in particular I would highlight the importance of getting rid of the article that would have forced the Member States, for the purposes of fiscal neutrality, to apply the same rates to all energy sources put to the same use. This amendment allows the Member States to retain different levels of tax on diesel and petrol. Increasing the excise duties on gas oil would actually have caused a drop in competitiveness in the European motor vehicle industry, which is traditionally stronger in the production of diesel engines, with obvious repercussions on employment. The greater energy efficiency of diesel engines is also a scientific fact, which is why we need to be able to retain a favourable tax regime on gas oil. For these reasons I voted in favour of the amendment to the Commission’s proposal, which removes the principle of fiscal neutrality. I also voted in favour of the report in question.</p>

It is a proposal for a directive, tabled by the Council, amending Council Directive 2003/96/EC on restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity. Over the last decade, the European public have been faced with continuous price increases for energy products, which has caused production inputs to become significantly more expensive, thereby increasing living costs. At a time when the global crisis is increasing the number of unemployed, causing wage freezes and delaying retirement ages, any measure exacerbating the price of these products could have very negative social effects. While I understand the need for us to move towards a low-carbon economy to prevent climate change, this process must be gradual, and must not suffocate the economy and, above all, people. I voted for this report because I believe the energy taxation approved in 2003 is out of date with respect to new CO2 -reduction rules under the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.

      <p sl="pt">This proposal for a directive on the taxation of energy products and electricity lays down that the rate of tax on a given product will combine the tax linked to CO2 emissions and that based on energy content. Beyond that, the Member States will be free to set their own rates of taxation, above the threshold levels imposed by the EU, and to work out their own taxation structure, reproducing the ratio between the minimum rates of taxation for the various energy sources. Given the continuous trend towards increased prices of final energy carriers, the energy taxation framework being proposed here, against a backdrop of continued neoliberal policies in this sector, will not fail to penalise consumers in general as well as the countries with less competitive economies, which currently already have serious competitiveness problems due to production-input costs relating to their specific situations. We are bound to express our concern at this.

The implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and our energy and climate policy goals requires a fair and transparent system of energy taxation that can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. In addition to providing a strong CO2 price signal to companies and consumers, the proposal enables us to shift tax burdens from labour to consumption, thereby giving preference to taxation that promotes growth.

      <p sl="pl">The energy directive that is currently in force only sets minimum taxation rates for energy products such as motor or heating fuels, as well as electricity, while the level of taxation depends solely on the consumption of energy sources. The European Commission proposal would change the current rules. It also proposes changes in the way that energy products are taxed in order to remove present imbalances and take into account CO2 emissions as well as the energy content of fuel products. In addition, it proposes a 10-year transition period to bring about a complete consolidation in the taxation system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of Poland the new solutions being proposed are practically impossible to implement without significant costs that, unfortunately, would be passed on to consumers. Over the next 10 years, there is no real possibility for Poland to obtain sufficient quantities of power from renewable sources, or to build nuclear power stations – as France has done – in order to discontinue use of coal. Coal has a lower calorific value than gas but has twice the emissions level, which means an increase in taxation and this means an increase in prices for the average citizen. The new provisions also affect Poland’s competitiveness, since almost 90% of electricity is generated from coal. Furthermore, a transition from a taxation system based solely on the amount of energy used to one based on fuel, where this is also dependent on the efficiency of that fuel, may result in the introduction of, in effect, a coal tax related to CO2 emissions which, in the case of my country, means an additional excise duty on coal to be introduced in 2013.</p>

In order to improve this situation, we ought to focus on renewable energies, as they are essential for economic development. Therefore, the real issue is not limited to how we should tax traditional forms of energy; it is also a question of how we can create incentives to use renewable forms of energy. Energy products must compete with one another so that the better form of energy will prevail in the future. Diesel and petrol both have advantages and disadvantages; no fuel can be classed as ‘better’. Therefore, the difference in taxation between diesel and petrol should be eradicated, but not necessarily by increasing the tax on diesel. What is more important is that, in this competition between sources of energy, the sustainable sources should gain a better position, and that is something that this proposal still fails to achieve.</p>

This proposal could also contribute to the implementation of our Europe 2020 strategy. However, we must consider the fact that it would also entail a considerable rise in diesel fuel prices in most Member States. Thus, even if we approve the minimum value for diesel, I do not find the introduction of the principle of proportionality in its current form to be desirable. This step would constitute interference in national tax policies, not to mention that the rise in diesel fuel prices would also cause an increase in the prices of several other goods.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I welcome the proposal from the Commission which will contribute to energy efficiency and climate protection in order not only to raise income, but mainly to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and also to influence consumer behaviour towards a more efficient use of energy and cleaner energy sources. I believe, however, that Member States should be free to make their own tax systems and to set their tax rates on energy products at a national level, whilst respecting the minimum levels. In the field of traditional fuels, I am concerned by the fact that implementing the principle of proportionality would risk increasing the tax on diesel. The negative impact would affect not only the daily lives of consumers and their purchasing habits, but also the haulage and automotive industries, which have in recent years made significant investments into research and development concerning diesel engines.</p>

That, in turn, would affect the economy, and an increase in transport costs would be passed on to consumers, which would push up inflation. I therefore have no option but to reject an increase in the taxation of diesel.

In debates in this House MEPs often regret that we do not have enough specific measures for combating climate change. In my opinion, the proposal presented by European Commissioner Algirdas Šemeta is welcome above all because uniform methods of calculation ensure fairness and uniform rules when setting taxes for different sources of energy. On the other hand, I agree that the proposal may seem too revolutionary for industry, particularly given long established practices and trends. I welcome the provision on the need to change the energy taxation framework and thus encourage energy efficiency and the use of less polluting fuel. If we want to achieve our objectives in the areas of combating climate change and energy efficiency this is a step we will still have to take. However, at the same time I also welcome the longer transition period which would enable the energy and automobile industries to adapt to the new requirements, along with the requirement that the European Commission analyse an impact assessment before taking appropriate steps.</p>

Of course it is important, but it is not as important as a sensible energy policy. We cannot permit a situation to occur where by 2018 there is a six-fold increase in tax on a fuel that is used to create 30% of the EU’s energy.

Less polluting biofuels will be taxed less than conventional fuels. This will encourage the creation of new environmentally friendly technologies. The new taxation rules are particularly important if Europe is seriously seeking to meet its obligations in the fight against climate change by 2020. The European Commission’s proposal will only set a minimum tax base. The EU countries will have more freedom to set taxes at the minimum or a higher level.

A number of critically important points came out of the debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The main bone of contention was the concept of ‘tax proportionality’, which was added to the directive by the Commission. The tax provides for the same minimum, mandatory rate on energy products in all Member States, which in turn will tax the various products proportionally, depending on their energy content and CO2 emission factor. Setting proportionally equal rates for all products would, however, curtail national sovereignty and restrict Member States’ room for manoeuvre, with negative repercussions on the energy sector that each country specialises in, inflationary risks, and detrimental effects for businesses and consumers. Luckily, during the vote in the sitting, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) managed to get rid of ‘proportionality’ through a specific amendment, which I also voted for.

      <p sl="nl">We, in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), support the principle that taxes on motor fuels, fuel oil and electricity should henceforth be based on energy content as CO2 emissions and, in addition, that a product should be taxed more heavily the more polluting it is. However, we could not support the principle of proportionality because this would have led to a sharp rise in the price of diesel, with all the negative consequences for companies and private consumers that would entail. It is now for the Council to deal with this considered opinion of Parliament wisely.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted against amending the directive on energy taxation because the proposal introduces two energy taxation components: one with taxation relating to carbon dioxide emissions and the other relating to the general consumption of energy. I voted against Amendments 21 and 44, which have been adopted by the European Parliament. Amendment 21 removes the option of applying exemptions and reductions benefiting households and charitable organisations, as provided for by Directive 2003/96/EC, while Amendment 44 restricts reductions being granted for heating to households only up to the start of 2025. I voted against Amendments 23 and 40 which removed the existing exemptions for fuels used in maritime and air transport. Maritime transport causes less pollution and is cheaper, which is why it must be encouraged. Air transport has been included in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) since 1 January 2012, and applying a new emissions-based tax would have meant double taxation. I also do not think it is appropriate to raise the level of duty on diesel, since in 2009 car producers were requested, based on a European regulation, to invest in cleaner engines. Raising the level of duty on diesel will affect both car producers and European citizens who have bought cleaner cars running on diesel.</p>

The wording of this report does not sufficiently address the problems of fuel poverty, which is faced by millions of people, and I feel that this is not an appropriate measure to take in the current economic climate. Furthermore, I could not support the proposal for fiscal neutrality for fuel, which would result in a huge hike in diesel prices at home.

In theory, it is about setting up common rules on taxation and permitted exemptions by setting minimal rates, essentially based on the quantity of energy consumed, beyond which the Member States are free to set their rates of taxation as they see fit. The introduction of a CO2 -based element is introduced to support the objective of a low-carbon economy.</p>

First of all, the harmonisation of European taxation standards removes the possibility of the Member States exempting certain sectors from energy taxation, in particular in the transport sector.

Secondly, energy taxation will essentially affect households: like VAT, it can only be socially unjust.

In other words, the most efficient and therefore the cleanest energy would have been subject to punitive tax levels. Moreover, given the severity of the crisis that has hit the automotive industry, we can see that such a measure could only weaken a key component of the European economy which, let me remind you, provides work for millions of people.

      <p sl="sk">On the one hand, taxing energy products used on the dual basis of CO2 emissions and energy content and, on the other, the observance by Member States of the principle of proportionality between the various minima set at EU level, would result in a substantial increase in the price of diesel in the vast majority of Member States. I therefore supported the opinion of the rapporteur, who rejected this proportionality because of its destabilising effect. Perhaps the worst result would be inflation, because the increase in diesel prices would translate into an increase in retail prices. I would like to clarify in this context that I do not reject the Commission’s efforts to eliminate the price advantage of diesel fuel. Such a neutral treatment of all fuels would provide a technologically neutral advantage to all CO2 -free fuels and would also encourage energy efficiency. However, I do not agree with the raising of the minimum tax rate using the method by which the Commission intends to achieve this status. Neutral taxation of fuels could also be achieved by reducing the minimum tax rate on petrol. Sadly, this solution did not occur to the Commission, the Member States, or my colleagues in this Parliament.

At a time when the prices of the various final energy carriers have been continuously increasing and few renewable energy sources have been introduced, it is worrying that, on the basis of climate concerns, the introduction of an energy taxation framework that will not fail to penalise consumers in general, as well as the countries with less competitive economies, which currently already have serious competitiveness problems due to production-input costs relating to their specific situations, is being proposed.

Estimates indicate that tax fraud and tax evasion cost the governments of the EU Member States a significant amount in uncollected revenues. This increases the deficit and debt levels of the Member States. It also reduces the funds available to boost public investment, growth and employment. Major problems also come about because tax fraud and tax evasion undermine citizens’ confidence in the fairness and legitimacy of tax collection. Countries participating in assistance programmes have, after stepping up tax collection and eliminating privileges in line with European Union’s proposals, seen many of their larger companies leave in order to benefit from tax privileges offered by other countries. Major improvements are therefore needed in the publicly available information on tax fraud and tax evasion in each Member State. EU Member States should review their tax systems with the aim of making them more effective and efficient, removing unjustified exemptions, broadening the tax base, shifting taxes away from labour, improving the efficiency of tax collection and tackling tax evasion It is also important to adopt European Union rules to prevent such forms of tax competition, which undermine the recovery strategies of the countries concerned.

      <p sl="it">The problem of tax evasion is increasingly important given the disproportionate size of the Member States’ public debts, which have further deteriorated as a result of the financial instability implicit in the current economic cycle. Rising taxes due to the austerity policies inevitably put in place by the Member States might actually be rather ineffectual if they are not accompanied by a move to bolster the means for combating tax evasion. Furthermore, we need to avoid the measures taken in Member States with financial difficulties resulting in businesses moving to countries offering tax privileges. Indeed, such forms of tax competition are among the most deleterious. Over the long term, they could lead to a disproportionate reduction in tax on business, which would be offset by an increase in taxes on employees, which by their nature are not so mobile. Accordingly, I decided to vote in favour of Parliament’s Resolution, which identifies concrete ways to combat tax evasion. Among these methods, I would especially like to highlight the need to abolish banking secrecy, increased controls to avoid funds being transferred to so-called ‘tax havens’, and the creation of new tools for combating value added tax evasion.

Lost revenues caused by the underground economy has pernicious effects on the European economy and a negative impact on the amounts invested in growth and employment. By recovering these lost revenues (20% of public spending and some 105.8% of total health spending), governments could wipe out their public debt in eight or nine years. At the same time, they would be able to increase public investment, helping towards the achievement of the goals of the EU 2020 strategy. We therefore welcome EU-wide initiatives and strategies that will cut back bilateral agreements and bring an end to banking secrecy, accelerating the exchange of information. Combating tax evasion must become an absolute priority for the EU. So far, much has been said but little has been done; now is the time to take incisive action.

      <p sl="en">Up to EUR 1 trillion in potential tax revenue in the EU is lost every year because of tax evasion. I think the Member State governments could repay all public debt within 8 to 9 years with resolute action against tax evasion. With an additional sum of EUR 200 billion, the EU could increase public investment from the current 2.7% of GDP to a realistic target of 3.5% within a few years. I am in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">On the one hand, tax fraud and tax evasion result in a significant loss of revenues and, on the other, they undermine the confidence of citizens in the fairness and legitimacy of the tax system. Many large companies have left countries in which tax collection has been improved and tax privileges have been eliminated in order to benefit from the tax privileges in other countries. Similar trends have been seen in connection with subsidies, too. Therefore, what is needed now is not only a review of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive and the Interests and Royalties Directive in order to eliminate evasion via hybrid financial instruments in the EU, but also a review of the EU subsidy jungle. Although we should support the fight against tax evasion, which is a burden on honest taxpayers, it does not befit the EU to call on the Member States in this context to refrain from bilateral negotiations with third countries. I therefore abstained.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for the resolution on the call for concrete ways to combat tax fraud and evasion because it concerns one of the scourges that – along with tax havens – does most damage to Member States’ tax capacity. As a recent study commissioned by the European Parliament Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament confirmed, the tax gap – that is, the difference between the sum chargeable in taxation and the sum actually collected – is overwhelming in the majority of EU Member States. If we want to safeguard the Member States’ to ensure funding for public duties, including the welfare state, we cannot allow such levels of lost taxation, particularly at a time of budgetary discipline and consolidation. Furthermore, it is clear that this cannot be achieved exclusively at national level.</p>

In my opinion, Member States must retain the option to make agreements with third countries, if such negotiations can bring benefits in terms of recovering illegally exported money.</p>
      <p sl="it">It would be desirable however if these problems could be prevented a priori , making it more difficult to find shelter in tax havens or obliging countries where it is then extremely difficult to investigate the nature and provenance of the money.

It is scandalous that they fraudulently avoid paying taxes despite already legally getting away with a scandalously low level of taxation. I call for an increase in taxation on big business and supported amendments which called for a 25% minimum rate of corporate taxation in the EU. I support the parts of the resolution that called for an end to banking secrecy, regulation and transparency of company registries and making the tax system more effective and efficient. However, the resolution favours less tax for corporations and supports the Fiscal Treaty. Moreover, experience shows that claims like ‘shifting tax away from labour’ in reality mean less direct taxation and more indirect taxation that hit workers and the poor hardest and are antisocial. This is seen in Ireland now with the imposition of household and water taxes which is another attempt to make workers pay for the crisis of capitalism.

      <p sl="pl">In Poland the grey economy comprises about 25% of GDP. In the European Union as a whole it averages 15%. This means there are enormous losses for state budgets. It results in increases in the indebtedness of individual countries and a lack of funds for important public services. In addition, the grey economy means there is a serious shortfall of funds for the pension systems of Member States. This is particularly important as public debates are taking place in many countries about a possible increase in the age of retirement. Tax avoidance on a massive scale was one of the causes of the Greek crisis. The example of Greece should be a lesson for the whole of the European Union and should force EU institutions and Member States to introduce rapid legal changes aimed at closing loopholes in the tax collection system.</p>

In the context of today’s European economy and economic downturn, tax collecting and tax policy issues become particularly important. Tax evasion and fraud are a key factor threatening the revenue of all countries and costing billions. It is not a problem that can be addressed at national level alone. Only an effective and targeted fight against tax fraud and evasion is the main way of obtaining the resources necessary to increase public investment in opportunities to improve Europe’s international competitiveness and increase growth. We should be effective in this fight not by policing but by creating an environment where evading taxes does not bring any benefits and is not worth the effort. The Council should draw up quantitative targets for the reduction of tax evasion in the EU by 2020 and complete the reform of the Savings Taxation Directive as soon as possible. This would reinforce automatic information exchange and ensure fair and appropriate taxation of savings throughout the EU.</p>

The policy of stabilising public budgets must focus on combating tax evasion more consistently and effectively.

If we want to encourage growth, we cannot offset the deficit with further taxation of entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The spectre of high unemployment is looming, and education and health are underfinanced. In my opinion, we should search for sources of finance in preventing massive tax evasion and tax fraud. I therefore expect the Commission and Council to accelerate initiatives to address this problem, because in my country too, the new government took over an economy from its predecessor where EUR 1.5 billion will be needed just for the consolidation of public funds. We need a further EUR 1.5 billion in order to meet the Maastricht criteria. At the same time, each year we are losing EUR 3 billion on tax evasion, of which EUR 2 billion is spent on VAT. Another estimated EUR 3 billion goes into the grey economy, and this is certainly money that, when eliminated, will not only ensure social peace, but will also be able to deliver growth very successfully.

The network of tax havens must be demolished and dismantled by preventing, sanctioning and taxing these financial transactions. We also reject the idea that all bilateral agreements established by the Member States should be authorised by the European Commission. Moreover, we reject the introduction of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, which will start taxing companies according to the results of applying the designated factors to the group’s profits, which may not – and, the majority of the time, will not – be the same as the company’s real profit.

      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioner Kallas, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to participate in the debate on the European Convention on Human Rights. As you know, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU is to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU’s accession to the Convention is a very important step for the protection of human rights in the EU. This matter is therefore particularly important to the EU itself, as well as being important to the Danish Presidency of the Council. I know that it is clearly very important to Parliament, too. This is clear from the declaration of 30 May 2010, in which Parliament expresses its clear support for the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. I am personally very pleased that Parliament has once again emphasised the importance of this matter by placing it on the agenda for the sitting here today. I would therefore like to thank you once again for the opportunity to discuss this matter, and I obviously look forward to hearing your views on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, I would like to start by telling you a little about the status of the work on this matter in the Council. Since the Commission received the mandate in June 2010 to negotiate, on behalf of the EU, with the Member States of the Council of Europe concerning the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, it has been working very hard to ensure that progress is made in this matter. As you know, the Commission has negotiated with the Member States of the Council of Europe on behalf of the EU. In this regard, the Commission has been in constant contact with the relevant working group in the Council with a view to ensuring that a common position can be reached among the EU Member States with regard to the draft accession agreement. The negotiations between the Member States of the Council of Europe and the Commission were provisionally concluded in June last year with a draft accession treaty.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, the necessary agreement within the Council on the draft accession agreement was lacking. Therefore, work has been going on intensively since October last year to produce a compromise proposal. The concerns expressed by individual Member States related to the competence of the International Court of Human Rights in cases relating to the common foreign and security policy. Another requirement that was the subject of in-depth discussions was the EU Member States’ voting rights in the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers. The compromise also contains a number of clarifications in respect of the fact that the EU is not a state, but an international organisation.</p>
      <p sl="da">As you know, the Council’s decision on the EU’s accession is to be taken unanimously. In the Presidency, therefore, we have worked hard to draw up a compromise in which we have been able to find solutions for the concerns that have been raised. With a view to maintaining progress in these very difficult negotiations, the Presidency decided to place the matter on the agenda at the Council meeting here next week. It is our hope that, in the light of the political discussions in the Council – that is to say those taking place next week – it will be possible to resume negotiations with the other Member States of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="da">We will continue to work during the Danish Presidency to ensure that there is progress in the negotiations on the draft agreement, and in this regard we will, of course, do our utmost to achieve a common EU position on the text.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, Minister, the Commission is strongly committed to the EU’s rapid accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. In July 2010 the Commission opened technical negotiations on behalf of the Union with a group of fourteen experts appointed by the Steering Committee for Human Rights of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft accession agreement is based on five basic principles: accession will be neutral regarding the powers of the Union and its institutions; accession will preserve, as much as possible, the existing convention system; accession will be neutral regarding Member States’ obligations under the Convention; accession will not affect the autonomous interpretation of Union law; and accession will be on an equal footing with other parties to the Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement introduces a ‘co-respondent mechanism’ to apply where Member States implement Union law and where the applicant before the European Court of Human Rights challenges that law. In such cases the Union may participate in proceedings before the Court. If the Court concludes that there is a violation of the Convention, the Union will be bound by the judgment and must change its law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement also ensures the possibility of a prior involvement of the Court of Justice, allowing the European Court of Human Rights to assess the compatibility with the relevant Convention rights of the provision of Union law which is called into question.</p>
      <p sl="en">The institutional rules of the accession agreement are very important. Firstly, a judge will be elected with respect to the Union at the European Court of Human Rights, with the same status and duties as the judges elected with respect to any other party to the European Convention of Human Rights. Secondly, the European Parliament will have the right to participate in electing all 48 European Court of Human Rights judges. Thirdly, the EU will have a voting right in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in Convention-related matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">There will be adequate safeguards to ensure that the Committee of Ministers can effectively exercise its supervisory functions under the Convention, even when the EU and all Member States are obliged to vote in a coordinated manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally there will be a flat-rate Union financial contribution to the expenditure related to the functioning of the Convention, borne by the budget of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The results reached so far come very close to the position expressed by the European Parliament in its own-initiative report of 18 May 2010. Since September 2011, the draft accession agreement has been discussed by the special committee designated by the Council. Some Member States have requested changes to the draft agreement. Good progress has been made in solving the issues raised and I would like to thank the Polish and Danish Presidency for their work on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress that the amendments envisaged preserve the overall architecture and balance of the draft accession agreement. The Commission, as the EU negotiator, will base itself on the orientations suggested by the special committee when negotiating the amendments to the draft agreement with the non-EU states of the Council of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the statements of the Council and Commission, which reveal that the EU’s accession to the Convention on Human Rights and the text of the relevant agreement are headed in a direction which will lead to added value for European citizens, because this is what the report I had prepared on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs before the opening of the negotiations was requesting, and because several elements of that report are reflected in the agreement. I must specifically thank the Commission for regularly informing the MEPs about the state of the negotiations, and for allowing us to express our opinions and make comments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The criteria of added value and effective assertion of rights must be applied when making any necessary compromises as well. However, I would also advise against fuelling excessively high expectations among European citizens. Accurate information on what this accession will actually be about is crucial, since failure to provide it would similarly undermine trust in EU institutions. While seeking compromises in connection with the accession agreement we should still not forget about the flipside, that is, the reform of the Strasbourg Court which has been emphasised since the beginning, and about its necessity. I trust that the Brighton Conference which was opened yesterday will provide reassuring answers for both sides in respect of any problems arising in connection with this reform.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The accession can only be successful if it truly reinforces existing European institutions, as well as Member State judicial systems, and all existing means by which these facilitate the assertion of citizens’ rights, not just in theory but also in everyday practice, and if we consider this agreement as such a means.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, colleagues, I am glad we are having this debate today. I am hoping for an open and public debate on the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and on the so-called reform of the European Court of Human Rights, as the two issues are closely connected.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regarding the EU’s accession to the European Convention, today we are in a situation of being in violation of the Treaties, particularly of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which makes accession binding. The file is stuck in the Council due to the objections of the UK Government and partially of the French Government.</p>
      <p sl="de">Concerning the so-called reform of the European Court of Human Rights, the UK Chairmanship of the Council of Europe is now – as we speak – holding a conference in Brighton, where several proposals are being discussed. I cannot stress enough how worried the European Court of Human Rights, the NGOs and human rights defenders are about some of these proposals. If accepted, these counter-reforms would severely diminish the rights of the victims of human rights violations.</p>
      <p sl="de">More than 60 MEPs have signed an appeal on these issues, which I have promoted in the European Parliament, and many national MPs have done the same.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me also express concern about the fact that these two issues are being dealt with without any transparency. The Council examines session documents that are not accessible to the public and do not even appear on the registers. This is a violation of the Regulation on Access to Documents.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Brighton Conference drafts are accessible only because of leaks. Neither the public nor NGOs have been consulted. This is not the way we should deal with fundamental rights issues in Europe. I think it is time for the Commission and the Council to make this clear to all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I appeal to the UK Government to change its position and to let the EU apply the Treaty of Lisbon obligations, and I trust that my colleagues here will do their utmost to ensure that this happens.</p>

      <p sl="en">blue-card question. – Madam President, why should the British public, or the French public for that matter, have any faith in a court which has judges from countries like Russia (witness the Khodorkovsky case) who are clearly not independent, and countries like Ukraine (witness the Tymoshenko case), where the judiciary is clearly not independent? Some of these judges have no judicial training – they are political appointees. Why should these foreign, unelected and unaccountable judges be able to decide on matters of our own national security and our criminal justice system in the United Kingdom? I am afraid there is no confidence in the integrity of this Court. It needs to be reformed and its powers need to be reined in.

      <p sl="en">blue-card answer. – Madam President, I think that my colleague is actually making a mistake and confusing the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg with the national courts in Russia, in Ukraine and in the other countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think there is a huge difference between the two. If someone knows how the European Court of Human Rights functions, they understand that there is always the possibility of having the right decision. So far the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, which was literally applied also by the Luxembourg Court of Justice, has proved that it was a very good court with very sound decisions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Bødskov, Commissioner Kallas, this week the future of the European Court of Human Rights is being debated and decided upon in Brighton. Undoubtedly, some of the planned reforms will strengthen the European human rights apparatus. Thus, it would be very welcome if those states that do not implement the judgments made in Strasbourg were more consistently punished in future. However, the progress outlined in the draft Brighton Declarations cannot conceal the fact that the United Kingdom is attempting to use its Presidency of the Council of Europe to substantially weaken the influence of the Court.</p>
      <p sl="de">If – as planned – national courts will be given greater discretionary powers in connection with the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, this runs the risk of undermining case law. Within Europe, different human rights standards could prevail. In addition, the planned reforms are clearly seeking to give citizens fewer opportunities to take cases to the European judges individually.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Member States are therefore called on to take a firm stance against this attempt at weakening the position of the Court, which will also result in a weakening of the whole human rights apparatus. Moreover, the European Union has committed itself in the Treaty of Lisbon to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Bødskov mentioned that Parliament called for this actually to be implemented two years ago. It is therefore high time that we set about doing this in a very decisive way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am proud that the United Kingdom was one of the founding members of the European Convention of Human Rights. This was designed to protect fundamental human rights – the right to life, the right not to be tortured and the right to a fair trial. The Convention has noble aims and my group supports them, but we do not support the conduct of the European Court of Human Rights. Far too often the Court departs from its role of upholding fundamental rights and interferes with how democratic governments govern themselves. The recent decision to prevent the UK deporting Abu Qatada is one example. The demand of the Court that prisoners be given the right to vote is another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such judicial activism brings the Court into disrepute. It must be reformed, with most cases dealt with at national level and national courts given a greater margin of appreciation for making decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group is committed to protecting human rights, but we do not believe that the EU should sign the Convention. Given that every Member State is already a signatory to the Convention, what benefit is there in the EU signing as well? It seems to me that the chief beneficiary is the EU itself, which gets to use its new legal identity granted by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an opportunity for the EU to strut on the world stage and make very little difference to human rights – and what difference it does make will be negative. We will have two courts adjudicating within the EU, introducing competing jurisdictions which will only complicate matters. It also raises the issue of the EU itself having a role in any future reform of the Court of Human Rights. Involving the EU is a recipe for ensuring that no further reforms ever take place. I would urge colleagues here, and in Westminster, to think again before granting the EU more influence that we will live to regret.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, last year I wrote to David Cameron urging him to oppose the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. The coalition government replied that they were obligated to accede to it and that in any case it would not change the existing situation regarding the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU accession to the ECHR is required under Article 6(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon. Mr Cameron could have given the decision to the British people by honouring his promise, indeed his cast-iron guarantee, of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="en">He reneged on that promise after the Labour Government had ratified the Treaty. But treaties are ratified by acts of parliament, and any act can be repealed. If he had wanted to, he could have repealed the ratification act and then submitted Lisbon to a referendum of the people. Instead he betrayed his promise and his guarantee turned out to be worthless.</p>

Perhaps if you took a little time to think about it, you would not want the United Kingdom to be a member of the United Nations in future, either.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, there are quite a few of us in this assembly who believe that human rights are fundamental values, not only for the European Union and its citizens but also for humanity as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was born of the horrors of the Second World War to protect citizens, including when States and their governments get out of control. The countries of Western Europe were particularly affected. They have long been pioneers in this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet, for several years, particularly since the attacks of 11 September 2001, respect for human rights in these countries has been in retreat. The verdicts of the European Court of Human Rights are there to show this. A growing number of Member States are convicted there on an increasingly regular basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU’s adhesion to the ECHR is now a symbol and we can clearly see that a number of Member States see Article 6 of the treaty as nothing more than a piece of paper. There are debates on what falls under European law and what falls under national laws and there is the issue of compatibility between the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the ECHR, with some Member States seeking to reintroduce the reservations that they put into the Charter in the debates on accession to the ECHR, even though all Member States are parties to the Convention. What then is the problem?</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are those who say that, if the European Union were to join, this must not call into question the powers of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Having met the current judges many times, I cannot see what the problem is. The CJEU has included fundamental rights in its case law since 1970. The integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty and membership of the ECHR will make it easier for it to enforce respect for the fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Others worry about the powers of the ECHR beyond the territory of the European Union. That, however, is its nature and I would go so far as to say that these issues should be raised when Article 6 is integrated. In reality, the problem is that some Member States are trying to call into question the very content of the ECHR and the role of the European Court, and to do so they will try anything.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On these benches, there are some of us who defend a universal, indivisible concept of human rights. We reject double standards where human rights are involved. We believe that, to be credible in the struggles that it hopes to undertake at the international level to promote human rights, the European Union and its Member States must start by getting their own houses in order.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, EU accession to the ECHR is a symbol and all of the current prevarication is symptomatic of the drift of some Member States in this area. These Member States who forever shirk the duties as regards human rights. It is not the Court that has changed, despite what I have heard, it is the respect for human rights by the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am here to tell you that there is one deeply flawed law that, above all others, damages British life and puts our lives in daily peril. It is the Human Rights Act. It is a rotten law that Britain loathes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights are worth protecting, and I am vocal in the protection of human rights. The Human Rights Act, however, was created in Britain by the Labour Party, which, despite warnings, was reckless as to the consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this EU-backed – and soon to be enshrined – law is now routinely and regularly abused by those who can cause havoc in civil society. Terrorists, criminals and illegal immigrants, with and without cats.</p>
      <p sl="en">More often than not, judges who apply human rights law decide that those rights trump those of the majority: decent, honest, hard-working British people. The case of Abu Qatada is attracting media attention. The human rights law, by allowing Abu Qatada to dodge deportation to Jordan, has inflamed the British public. Simply, the Court of Human Rights leaves Britain unable to defend its interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a recent survey, 75% of British people said they think that the act should be scrapped altogether. It is the Treaty of Lisbon that allows the EU to sign up to the ECHR, which further imprisons the British public, who never got a chance to say no through a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me tell you, the British public are shouting aloud: ‘No to the human rights law! Release us from these shackles’.</p>

      <p sl="it">I will not hide the problems, which are not structural – since you might say that we have already resolved those – but certainly substantial and procedural. They, however, can only be resolved in practice, once the Union has acceded to the Convention.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of the substance, there is one particular issue. As far as I know, this is the only case in the world in which a declaration, a legally binding act on human rights, applies to a territory where there is another legal act – the Convention of the Council of Europe – which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This certainly poses a few problems, especially in procedural terms: who will have the last word?</p>
      <p sl="it">That is the major problem, but we cannot resolve it now. Meanwhile, let us get on with accession. The solution will emerge from case law, probably using the principle that the European Court of Human Rights applies, whereby all other remedies must already have been attempted before recourse may be made to the Court. In this sense, the European Court of Human Rights could be the court of last instance, even after the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, this debate is taking place because we have a dual mandate. To start with, according to the Treaty of Lisbon, a mandate under the Treaty on European Union is not a suggestion – far from it. It indicates a mandate to conclude the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. We also have a negotiating mandate that binds the Commission, to ensure that the execution of that mandate becomes reality.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reasons are very good. The European Convention on Human Rights, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights, which guarantees it, has contributed fundamentally to a Europe-wide judicial culture that has improved the lives of millions of Europeans who have seen their demands met before the European Court of Human Rights when they had exhausted the judicial resorts available to them under their own legal systems to guarantee their fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are aware that this presents difficulties. We have been negotiating for some time now. The time has come for us to carry out this mandate and bring about its fulfilment.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg should enter into discussion and this will undoubtedly be a complex issue. What is clear, however, is that this enhances the legal protection of European citizens’ rights and it is time, therefore, for the Commission to make every effort to resolve with the Council the obstacles that some Member States continue to put in the way so that European citizens finally see this mandate that is in the Treaty of Lisbon fulfilled.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is not a single country that has not seen an improvement in the attention to human rights that are guaranteed by the Convention as a consequence of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and, insofar as there is an injustice that it has been possible to put right through the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, it follows that the mandate makes perfect sense and it is time to bring it to fulfilment.</p>

So the purpose of the Convention, the purpose of the Court, is that it requires governments to meet certain standards – just as many of us want it to require the EU to meet certain standards and to call governments and other authorities to account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now there may be judgments from the European Court that we do not like. There are some that I am not too happy about. But the whole point is that it is not a pick-and-mix. You do not simply take those judgments that you like and put them into practice, while with others you simply say: I did not like the judges who made that. If you do not like the judges, argue for the reform and training of the judges, and then when you are making those arguments, also remember that a lot of court findings are against countries such as Russia and Ukraine, the very places we have heard complaints about.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is about the rule of law, within a human rights context; about how governments and other authorities respond to being held to account. That is something I want to see brought in for the European Union, not left outside.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I believe that every single person in this Chamber thinks that the European Union should support the protection of human rights. However, as regards the Union’s accession to the convention, we have doubts, as I do personally, about the wisdom of such a move.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, I would like to know what guarantees there are that this will not result in greater competition between the two courts. Even now there are jurisdiction disputes between Strasbourg and Luxembourg and this causes certain problems.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another important issue is the scale of financial support to be provided by the Union to the European Court of Human Rights. We should also remember that every European Union Member State has already signed the convention. What then will be the added value created by the European Union as a whole adopting it? What effect will this have on the internal legal system of each EU Member State? I am unfortunately of the opinion that the only motive behind this idea is to emphasise the status of the European Union as an important player in the international arena.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, when it comes to the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights, I believe it is very important that we are aware of the fact that we will come up against a number of problems, where we will increasingly be transferring a number of powers, a number of freedoms in fact, from Member States to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are increasingly facing the problem where once cases have been fully decided and they have already undergone a full judicial process in a Member State, they then reach the European Court of Human Rights after an appeal. This means that the European Court of Human Rights actually amounts to a kind of government of judges, consisting of a number of judges who are accountable to no one, and who are radically opposed to any policy democratically outlined in Member States and who make it impossible for Member States to impose a more restrictive immigration policy. Even the fight against terrorism is increasingly being compromised by the outlook taken by these judges. I refer in this regard to the case of Abu Qatada in the United Kingdom. This has to stop and the European Parliament needs to keep a close eye on this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in thanking the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, but this debate is especially timely and important because we are facing two unacceptable violations of the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">The violation of the letter – as many speakers have pointed out – is the European Union’s boycott on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is clearly set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and is a essential complement to the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The violation of the Treaty’s spirit, meanwhile, relates to the project currently under discussion in Brighton to amend the Convention, reducing citizens’ opportunities to appeal to an unacceptable extent.</p>
      <p sl="it">These are truly paradoxical proposals, not only because Protocol 14 has already significantly reformed the Court’s procedures, but also because, in more general terms, solving the problem of too many pending cases by reducing opportunities to appeal is like combating an epidemic by closing hospitals.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem is not too many appeals, it is too many violations of rights in Europe and that is what governments should be worrying about. Parliament is therefore very concerned and highly vigilant. We think a reaction that prevents the kind of reforms under discussion in Brighton is of the utmost importance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have already affirmed the full commitment of the UK Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government to EU accession to the Convention. I certainly speak for all Liberal Democrat ministers, parliamentarians and members. I think I have sufficiently refuted the suggestion by British Labour MEP Richard Howitt, whom I see in his place, in a debate two days ago that LibDems were somehow apologists for Tory hostility to the Strasbourg Convention and Court. But before I leave the intra-British debate, for which I apologise to other colleagues, I must remind Labour MEPs that their former Justice Secretary Jack Straw utterly failed to stand up for human rights, and once called the Human Rights Act a ‘villain’s charter’ in remarkably similar terms to Ms Sinclaire, whom Mr Cashman rightly criticised.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to express complete British LibDem support for strengthening the European Court of Human Rights. The Brighton Conference currently taking place – and I share Renate Weber’s dismay at the lack of transparency – must enhance the ability of the Court to issue robust and authoritative judgments. But the Court does need streamlining and relieving of its huge backlog. National courts must do the heavy lifting of implementation of the Convention, and that is why the Convention needs to be incorporated and remain incorporated in domestic law, as in the UK Human Rights Act.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Strasbourg Court must not be a routine court of appeal, but an effective and respected watchdog for 47 states and the EU. I hope and trust that will be the result of the Brighton Conference tomorrow.</p>

The European Convention on Human Rights has been used by people like Abu Hamza and terrorist suspects to prevent their extradition to countries like America on the basis that their human rights might be abused.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I have sat in courts dealing with European Arrest Warrant cases, and one in particular where the European Convention was invoked because it was almost certain that, in being extradited to Greece, suspects would be held in the Korydallos Prison, where it was 100% guaranteed that their human rights were going to be violated. But the government prosecutor put the point that since Greece was a signatory of the Convention on Human Rights it could not be deemed to be in breach of it. The appeal court agreed and the suspects were extradited.</p>

      <p sl="en">Wearing my other hat, which I used to be able to do in the British Parliament, helped secure an amendment to the 2003 Extradition Act, which requires the judge, before agreeing to extradition under the European Arrest Warrant, to decide whether someone’s Convention rights would be breached. I do not know why that has never succeeded in a UK court but I was there to make sure that this law applies and I will go on insisting that human rights apply to internal EU extradition.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, the Strasbourg court did not prevent the extradition of Abu Hamza to the United States. We can disagree on whether that was the right decision but in fact they did say he would get a fair trial, even if he would be subject to harsh conditions after conviction.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the question has been raised what the added value of the EU’s accession to the Convention is. I would like to make it clear that this represents a new option of legal remedy for those European citizens who can also take their complaints related to violations of fundamental rights within the EU before the Strasbourg Court, so there is added value. Or more precisely, they could take them before the Court if it were not for some Member States obstructing this accession. We have heard in this debate which countries these are, and which one is foremost among them. This gives just as much cause for concern as some of the proposals regarding the reform of the Strasbourg Court that have been put forward at the Brighton Conference taking place right now. These include the new admissibility criterion, according to which a case would not be admissible to the Court of Human Rights if it has already been investigated by a Member State court. This would severely hamper the enforcement of human rights and the right of access to legal remedy, in particular for the citizens of countries where the judiciary cannot be considered independent.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We would like to see guarantees that easing the excessive workload of the Court of Human Rights will not be to the detriment of human rights guarantees. We are all aware of the excessive workload, but the solution should not be sought in the direction the Brighton Conference has taken. We hope that this decision will not be the final one. What we can support has indeed also been stated here today, namely the provision of sufficient funding for the Court of Human Rights. We must wait and see the effects of the reforms undertaken over the recent years, and we must improve the application of the Convention on Human Rights and the quality of legislation in the Member States. We must achieve the commitment of European governments to implementing the decisions of the Court of Human Rights. If we succeed in all this, then the excessive burden of the Strasbourg Court will surely ease, and it will continue to be able to fulfil its duty which we find so important.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, with the adoption of the Stockholm Programme in December 2009, the European Council decided that the European Union would accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. On the accession of the European Union as an organisation of regional groupings, it is subject to certain conditions, which are different from those defined for the accession of countries. The wording of the Treaty of Lisbon states that legislative acts of the Union apply in their effects on individuals only by means of implementing or applicable national measures. With the Union’s accession to the Convention, it would therefore be necessary to transfer the specific characteristics of the judicial system of the Union within the framework of the principles governing the functioning of the control mechanisms established by the Convention, particularly the principle of subsidiarity. Given the complexity and scope of the changes resulting from accession to the Convention, I therefore respect the attitude of those EU Member States which are not subject to populist pressures in favour of the excessive acceleration of this challenging process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, looking at the gallery, I think that they must have wondered what kind of circus they had stumbled into. The European Union is based solely on absolute fundamental universal human rights. Yes, the Court needs reform – nobody argues with that – but the way to reform it is by being engaged with it. In order to have coherence between national law and EU law, it is vital that the EU accedes to the European Convention on Human Rights. And of course, judges never deliver judgments which please politicians all of the time, and that is good. Because they are there to give a voice to people who are often trampled underfoot.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want you to imagine that there are citizens living in one country of the European Union who are not allowed to serve in the military, who do not have a right to a family life, who have no succession of housing when their partner dies, whose very sexuality is criminalised, for whom there is not an equal age of consent, nor equal treatment. Their only recourse – those citizens living in the United Kingdom, those lesbians and gay men and bisexuals – was to the European Court of Human Rights, and because of their judgments, they were afforded – eventually – universality and respect for their human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now if a government does not agree with the judgments, it also has the opportunity to derogate from the judgment, for it to go back to the national parliament. That is exactly what happened when the judgment was given that the ban on prisoners being forbidden the right to vote was in contravention. The UK Parliament merely had to note that and continue with what it was doing. But you know what? The world is a better place if somewhere like the European Court of Human Rights makes the lives of politicians more difficult.</p>

I am pleased that this accession will further enhance and foster the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms in the EU thanks to the fact that the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will assume the power to review the compliance of the Union’s actions with the Convention.

      <p sl="es">It is important because, firstly, we are talking about basic EU values and a legal obligation that appears, as already mentioned, in the Treaty on European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The economic crisis is putting the European social model at risk. All we need is to show signs of weakness in the sphere of human rights as well, a sphere which is a symbol of European identity.</p>

Limiting citizens’ access to the European Court is bad news. For it to happen as a result of the penny-pinching attitude of some States strikes me as serious and troubling and for it to be done in a secretive way seems like a mockery at a time when we are celebrating the implementation of the European citizens’ initiative.</p>

      <p sl="en">To return to the subject, as we speak it is true that Ken Clark, our UK Justice Secretary, is indeed trying to convince 46 other ministerial colleagues in the Council of Europe to reform the intrusive powers of the European Court of Human Rights which, in my view, now seems far too often to champion the phoney human rights of the criminal or terrorist rather than protect the victims. This court is deeply unpopular and, in my view, brings the whole of the European Union into disrepute because, in the eyes of the Daily Mail readership, the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe are one and the same thing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have no faith in the judges of the court, some of whom, as political appointees, have no judicial training. Presumably the Russian judge, who was politically appointed, takes his instructions from the Kremlin.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course my party defends fundamental civil and political rights for all of our citizens, but the accession of the EU to the Convention and to the Court of Human Rights will result in competing jurisdictions between the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights, cause extra costs and give extra powers to unelected and unaccountable judges.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this was certainly a very interesting discussion of the issue of accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. I remember that this was a topical issue 15 years ago in my own country, where the European Convention on Human Rights was already regarded very positively as a means of improving the judiciary and the legal system.</p>
      <p sl="en">By acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Union will integrate itself into a pan-European legal space of fundamental rights protection. It will enhance its credibility by entering into a commitment under international public law to respect fundamental rights. The EU will submit itself to external judicial control. So accession also means that the EU reaffirms the pivotal role played by the Convention system in the protection of human rights in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Much has already been done on the way to accession. But some important steps still remain. Negotiations with the 20 non-EU States of the Council of Europe must be completed. Once a final text has been agreed, the Commission will submit the draft agreement to the Court of Justice for an opinion on its compatibility with the Treaties. After a positive opinion, the Council will have to adopt – by unanimity – decisions on the signature and conclusion of the agreement. The latter decision requires the consent of the European Parliament and will only enter into force if Member States approve.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding international law, the accession agreement has to be ratified by the 47 current state parties to the European Convention of Human Rights and approved by the Union. The EU legislature will also have to adopt internal legal rules to properly implement accession internally.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am absolutely confident that the parties involved are fully aware that the governments and parliaments of all Member States made a promise to citizens, and gave a strong signal to the outside world, when they committed the Union to accede to the Convention. I can also add that the Commission agrees that it is necessary to work intensely on the internal rules from now on. Solutions must be workable in practice and respect the institutional order of the Union as defined by the Treaties.</p>

I therefore also look forward to the political discussions at the Council meeting next week. On the basis of these discussions, it is our hope that it will be possible to resume negotiations with the other Member States of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I regard the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as a welcome step because the EU needs to have a clearly defined system for protecting fundamental rights. I applaud that it will make a major contribution to strengthening the system of human rights throughout Europe, by providing citizens with increased protection, including in relation to EU legislation. This is not a new subject for debate. However, the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon provide the legal instruments required to implement this project. The European Union is founded on respect for human rights and already has a ‘Charter of Fundamental Rights’. However, a specialised judicial mechanism is also required to ensure that they are promoted and protected fully. The Court of Justice of the European Union does not have specific powers regarding this matter, whereas the court in Strasbourg has lengthy and varied practical experience in this area. While there has been informal consultation until now between both courts, which has ensured consistent practice, this accession will require technical harmonisation, both with regard to the status of the two courts and to the details of cooperation on jurisdiction. This will also entail significant benefits for Member States, providing legal clarity and avoiding potential conflicts of jurisdiction or discrepancies between the provisions of the ECHR and EU legislation.</p>

A particularly worrying aspect of this issue is the fact that these Member States, which oppose or are seeking to delay the EU’s accession to the ECHR, are also seeking a reform of the European Court of Human Rights, which would restrict citizens’ opportunities to approach the Court directly and would undermine this Court’s competence and powers. The European Parliament is already receiving letters from concerned citizens, for whom, even in our more democratic European countries of the 21st century, the opportunity to approach the ECHR directly and the fact that this Court’s judgements are binding on Member States, often represent the last chance for them to redress injustice done to them.

The debate in Parliament was juxtaposed with negotations at the Brighton Conference to reform the ECHR under the chairmanship of the UK. There is growing discontent that domestic sovereignty over controversial issues such as the deportation of known terrorists and the lawfulness of banning convicted criminals from voting is undermined by unelected judges in the ECHR who are not accountable to the public and override the British legal system with questionable judgments. EU accession to the ECHR would result in a tighter net forming around UK membership to the Convention from which Britain would struggle to be freed. It is essential that the EU and the ECHR remain entirely independent. However I fear the proposed accession of the EU to the ECHR is designed to pave the way for Brussels to become the primary legal power in Europe in association with the European Courts of Human Rights.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The defence of fundamental human rights forms the basis of our Union's principles and values. The Treaty of Lisbon provides for the EU’s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, the question that faces us today is less technical than political. The reservations expressed by certain Member States, especially as regards the Court in Strasbourg, call into question the very principle of the separation of powers. How can we expect Europe’s citizens to defend their fundamental rights if we impose the principle of subsidiarity and restrictive accessibility criteria on the European Court of Human Rights and considerations of ‘margins of appreciation’ on these judgments?</p>
      <p sl="fr">For me a strong Court, accessible to the citizens, defending their rights with the utmost neutrality, is essential if democracy is to work properly in Europe. I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to show a strong political will to continue to ensure the integrity and the authority of the Court at Strasbourg and finally to make the Union’s process of accession to the ECHR accessible to civil society’s stakeholders.</p>

      <p sl="de">The accession of the EU to the Convention on Human Rights is to be rejected for several reasons. Firstly, there is absolutely no need for it, as we already have the fundamental rights judicature of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Individuals can submit an action for annulment in order to get legal acts reviewed. In addition, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have had our own Charter of Fundamental Rights. Secondly – and I find this highly problematic – the EU will be subjecting itself to external scrutiny by the European Court of Human Rights. Quite apart from conflicts of competence with the Court of Justice of the European Union, how can we have a situation where our legal acts are reviewed by judges from Azerbaijan, Ukraine or Turkey? These countries are not in the EU, nor do they have much time for human rights. Lastly, with regard to content, do we really need a court that wants to nullify the Dublin II Agreement? Do we need a court that we have to fight right to the highest level in order to obtain permission to hang up crucifixes, a court that wanted to prohibit Italy from refusing to accept the influx of migrants into Lampedusa, or one that wanted to prohibit England from refusing to accept marriages of convenience? This far left judicature of the European Court of Human Rights is something we do not need.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, Regulation 2252, adopted in 2004, was an important step towards our improving and harmonising standards for protecting passports and travel documents. We have introduced biometric identification elements to establish a more reliable link between the document and its true holder.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, passport security is not confined to the passport itself: the whole process, beginning with the presentation of the documents – known technically as ‘breeder documents’ – needed for a passport to be issued, followed by the collection of the biometric data, and ending with checking and ‘matching’ at border control posts, is relevant.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is useless to increase the level of passport security if we continue to allow weak points in other parts of the chain. Examples of this include the recent news story that around 10% of biometric passports in circulation in France are fake, having been obtained on the basis of falsified documentation, or the case of a study submitted during a hearing before the Netherlands Parliament revealing that a test undertaken by a local government proves that more than 20% of digital impressions collected were non-verifiable and therefore useless.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Freedom of movement in the Schengen area is, without a doubt, one of European integration’s greatest successes, but it requires a high level of security. The existence of secure passports and documents that function effectively and efficiently contributes to this. It is therefore imperative to find solutions to any problems that may exist with regard, firstly, to confidence in the process of collecting biometric data; secondly, to the reliability and usefulness of digital impressions for different age brackets, specifically in relation to children and older people; thirdly, to the existing disparities between Member States concerning documents – ‘breeder documents’ – that may be used as a basis for issuing passports; and, fourthly, to the way in which digital impressions can be ‘matched’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">You know, Commissioner, that the Council was responsible for sending the Member States a questionnaire enabling analysis of possible shortcomings in the identification systems, and of the numbers of errors recorded, so as to evaluate the need to introduce a European system. These concerns were included in our revision of the regulation in 2008, so Parliament introduced a clause for its review after three years, so as to enable the Commission to undertake studies and receive the results of this questionnaire.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The question I am asking, Commissioner, is does the Commission already have the results to present to us and, in the light thereof, is it thinking of tabling any legislative proposal that may be necessary?</p>

    <intervention id="4-459-000" speaker_id="96859" name="Ioan Enciu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the current problems concerning the large number of falsified biometric passports are largely due to insufficient attention being paid to the whole process for issuing them. As is correctly stated in the European Parliament report compiled in 2008, it is not enough to guarantee a high level of passport security if the way in which the passports are obtained is not as secure. I believe that the key persistent problems derive from the reliability of the data collected, especially for children and the elderly, not to mention the host of breeder documents accepted as proof of identity for issuing passports, as well as their level of security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In other words, there is no point in producing secure passports if they are issued on the basis of false documents. To tackle these problems, the Commission must provide a clear assessment of the current shortcomings within the whole process of issuing passports. I believe that the most important aspect which needs to be taken into account concerns breeder documents. At the moment, there are dozens of different documents at EU level which can be used as the basis for issuing a passport, and many of these documents have dubious security levels, making them easy to counterfeit.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why two steps need to be taken. First of all, the number of breeder documents that are accepted for issuing passports must be restricted; secondly, minimum security standards must be introduced for these breeder documents. On the same lines, one option worth considering is to harmonise the templates for national identity cards at EU level. This step is necessary because identity cards are used most frequently both as breeder documents and as travel documents within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Lastly, I would also like to stress once again the need for the Commission to carry out an in-depth study on the security of the entire process for issuing biometric documents, since this will be particularly relevant to the future systems featuring as part of Smart Borders.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, our group supported the call at the time of the last amendment to the Biometric Passports Regulation in 2009 for a review to be carried out in three years’ time and for four studies to be presented. One of the reasons that our group supported this was because it has expressed major concerns time and again on the grounds of data protection and also on account of the overestimation of the benefit of using biometric data in passports.</p>
      <p sl="de">The belief in the perfect form of identification, the overestimation of this method too, and – associated with this – the overestimation of other parts of the security chain are genuinely problematic. The use of biometric data is still subject to this major misconception, namely the assumption that these data are unchangeable and mostly reliable. That is absolutely not the case. These data are also subject to change throughout a person’s life. They differ between childhood and old age. We therefore need reliable and sound studies and conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="de">People are still busily forging these documents. We have now been able to establish this. As the incidents in the United Kingdom and other countries repeatedly demonstrate, the chips are definitely not safe from misuse. They are readily cracked and, for those concerned, this can result in permanent damage. The standards within the EU also differ widely. The error rate – as seen in France and the Netherlands – is very high. We need to ask ourselves again and again what benefit we get from biometric data if documents are falsified and enter into circulation. Thus, if one part of the chain is falsified and the ‘breeder’ documents are at variance, biometric data would no longer be of any help to us.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Chaos Computer Club in Germany needed a few minutes only to demonstrate the falsification of a chip. For this, the people of the Chaos Computer Club needed the cap of a plastic bottle, some superglue, a digital camera and a little wood glue, and in a few minutes they had cracked the chip. So much for supposed security. We are waiting for the Commission to present the studies and, of course, also the results and the lessons that can be drawn from them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Carlos Coelho for initiating this important debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is obviously very important to make travel documents more secure and we have been working on that for a decade both in the EU and of course in the US and other countries. However, as technology advances, so does the ease with which criminals can exploit weaknesses in our system. Most of my work on biometric identifiers has been done in the area of visas, but I have always expressed the concern that it would be a false illusion to put too much trust in biometrics as if somehow once they are captured and used we can have 100% faith. As has been said by others, they are only as good as not only the technology but the competence of the officials running the system and indeed the cooperation of individual applicants.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is a fair question to ask where we are at. In negotiating the Visa Code in 2009, in which I was involved, Parliament successfully required that we should not fingerprint children under 12 due to the unreliability of such fingerprints. Obviously assessments will be done in the future on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier this year Sophia in 't Veld and I asked the Commission to comment on the Dutch study that is mentioned in the question which shows that in many cases the fingerprints taken were non-verifiable and therefore useless.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission responded that no major problems had been reported and drew our attention to a JRC study, due out in May, on the reliability of information stored on chips in electronic passports. The problem with this is that it has been done on the basis of voluntary information supplied by Member States, so I think that we need a study which is more comprehensive on failure rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the Visa Code the Commission should present a report in June this year including an evaluation of the collection of data and documents used for creating biometric passports. We are not just concerned about passports. We are also concerned about visas and fingerprinting practices across the range of travel and identity documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unlike the Commission, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has in a 2010 report expressed concerns about weaknesses in the evidence-gathering chain and admitted that the US system continues to be vulnerable to fraud. If this is true of the Americans then I fear it could well be true in the EU.</p>

    <intervention id="4-462-000" speaker_id="96734" name="Franziska Keller" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I very much agree with the criticism that my colleagues have already expressed and I want to ask the same question about what stage this evaluation has reached, and whether it can solve the questions that we have raised and answer our concerns, such as the issues of ‘breeder’ documents and the falsified documents and biometric passports in France and elsewhere, because this is really undermining any usefulness of biometric passports.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, biometric passports also have fundamental rights implications. It has just been ruled under French constitutional law that parts of the French biometric passport law are unconstitutional because law enforcement agencies and state authorities have access to fingerprints. Fingerprints are seen as very sensitive data because you can leave them without intending to do so. That of course calls into question whether this will be applicable in the Member States. We have also seen elsewhere in the EU that law enforcement agencies and authorities are trying to get access to fingerprints</p>
      <p sl="en">Even when all these questions have been solved, there will still be the issue of whether it is really necessary and useful to collect all the biometric data of people who travel, and for what purpose we are collecting those data. We will have to see whether the costs of such biometric gathering will actually be compatible with any use that we get out of them, and whether the costs are appropriate and comparable with their usefulness.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think under any circumstances that we should collect more and more biometric data and expand the use of biometric data before those concerns are clarified and before the Commission can prove that they are actually verifiable and that there are no huge problems and errors in collecting the data, as we heard with regard to children, older people, etc.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the opportunity for this House to discuss the important issue of border security, be it body scanners, PNR or border agencies. This opportunity to debate standards on security and border efficiency in Europe is one that should be continued as a priority. Since this House adopted in 2004, and subsequently reviewed, the Regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents, it is clear that several questions have emerged as regards flaws in the systems and potential security implications.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to ask the Commission whether or not its research has shown the system to create higher levels of security and ease of travel, and whether it has proven to be effective and cost efficient. More importantly, I would like also to ask the Commission what initiatives it has taken to combat the increasing problems of cross-border fraud, identity theft, and loss of biometric passports. Both Europol and Member States’ authorities have cited stolen passports as one of the most significant security threats we face.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final issue is this: is technology changing rapidly enough for biometric passports to keep ahead of the technical abilities of sophisticated criminals perpetrating fraud, and is a biometric system being backed up with the necessary level of border checks in order to make sure that Europe’s borders are as impenetrable as possible to criminals?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the study that you have requested, focusing on fingerprints for children below the age of 12, is currently being carried out by the Joint Research Centre. The issue of the reliability of fingerprints from elderly people was not included in the mandate and is therefore not part of this study.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to perform its scientific analysis, the Research Centre needed reliable data from children below the age of 12 taken twice from the same person, with an interval of at least two years. Such data could be provided only by Member States and Portugal volunteered to provide data from its national passport database. Access to the data was granted by the Portuguese authorities last November after the conclusion of the appropriate Portuguese procedure for ensuring that all the data protection aspects were duly considered. For that reason, the study is not yet finished and the final result therefore not available. There will be an intermediate report presented by the Research Centre in May this year. It will present preliminary conclusions regarding the evolution of children’s fingerprints based on limited algorithms developed by academia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The intermediate report will be presented to the European Parliament by the June deadline specified in the Regulation. The final results will provide comprehensive information on the evolution of fingerprints of children under 12 and the technical feasibility of using them for identification and verification purposes. The final report will also include an evaluation of whether the biometric matching algorithms available on the market now or in the near future can be used effectively with children’s fingerprints. The draft final report will be available in mid-2013. Based on the final results of the study, the Commission will consider proposing amendments to the Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the technical issues related to the biometric enrolment process, these issues have been clarified in a decision from August last year amending the technical specifications for passports. Requirements for taking fingerprints are clarified by means of an enrolment guide annexed to the decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, undertakes tests on Member States’ passports’ compliance with this Regulation and with the relevant technical specifications. While compliance testing is a standard procedure, it is currently carried out by national accredited laboratories, and the Joint Research Centre has performed and already reported on additional testing of the chips on electronic passports – provided on a voluntary basis because it is the only way we can proceed – by some Member States to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Further reports will be issued in May this year, including a report on the compliance of the Dutch sample passports received. If non-conformity is found, the Commission will, of course, take the appropriate measures. We are also conducting a report on identity theft; this we take very seriously and, as soon as that is ready, we will report to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to the last question on obtaining authentic documents, this is related to identity theft. We are aware of this type of fraud and we will report on the result of the study as soon as possible and then discuss with you the possible measures to take.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Coelho, thank you. We must highlight the advances represented by the use of biometric passports but we cannot deny the problems that exist in terms of implementation, especially the weaknesses detected in the passport-issuance chain. It would serve no purpose to equip border controls with great technical instruments if the system has a significant weakness in terms of procedures.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this context, if we take it into account, the balance between combating crime in the EU, respecting individual rights and guaranteeing free movement in the Schengen area takes on even greater importance.</p>
      <p sl="es">The forging of documents, organised crime and terrorism constitute direct attacks on our citizens but also on their personal rights and so we must reinforce the whole process of gathering and handling information of a personal nature. We must afford greater security to the travel document, establishing a reliable link between the passport and its holder.</p>
      <p sl="es">Accordingly, repeated fraudulent practice provides ample justification for the evaluation reports. Commissioner Malmström, we await the intermediate report scheduled for June, and the report scheduled for mid-2013, with great interest. We continue to back training for those responsible for managing the system, along with improvements to and interoperability of equipment and documents issued at each of the stages, without compromising, of course, either the information or the rights of the holder of the passport.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, being in a position to determine the scope of the issue of fingerprinting children, which, as has already been stated, is currently under study, is very important. Therefore, I place great value on the Portuguese Government’s decision to give reliability to the procedure.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I welcome the initiative of this discussion, which allows us to return to the concerns that have already been expressed in the past on the reliability of biometric passports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We were told at the time that the introduction of biometric information would improve the security of travel documents and would benefit the security of our fellow citizens. A recent survey showed that 10% of French passports could be false, as their production relies on documents that are extremely easy to falsify, namely copies of birth certificates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, how is it possible to imagine that the multiplication of biometric data and other secure chips is the best way to protect our fellow citizens. The existing shortcomings ought to encourage us to be more prudent. By insisting on defending security at any cost, by rushing into the collection of personal data, we end up whittling away our fellow citizens’ areas of freedom, especially with the creation of databases that could be used for purposes other than in the general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another dimension that I would to raise here concerns the sometimes obscure, vested interests hiding behind such developments: the manufacturers of body scanners and electronic chips and data gathering and security companies. All of these industrial lobbies have a clear interest in promoting these security-oriented technologies, which, to say the least, is worrying.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the face of this rationale of saving data on the population that we are seeing more or less all over Europe, we need to be vigilant as regards the risk of violations of privacy. That is why I am insisting in this debate that the use of biometric data must be proportionate to the intended goal. A complete overhaul of the rules providing for the inclusion of biometric information in passports and travel documents is therefore imperative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, as regards the assessment carried out by the Commission on the implementation of these rules at national level, you have given us a number of very useful clarifications. We await with impatience, therefore, the various reports, the first of which ought, I believe, to appear quite soon.</p>

In the Netherlands, a recent request for access to documents revealed that the justification given at the time, namely document fraud and particularly lookalike fraud, was actually only established in between 20 and 40 cases in the course of a year in a country with nearly 17 million inhabitants.</p>
      <p sl="de">So one wonders why this whole system – which is extremely costly and which clearly has a lot of shortcomings – had to be introduced on such a thin justification. I wonder if the Commission is going to include that element and that information in its evaluation.</p>

This was said in this Parliament on 1 December 2004 and, as we see now, it was providential. We are very thankful to Mr Coelho for initiating this question and the debate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, up until noon we were discussing the problem of human trafficking, an issue which generates much emotion and involves tragic experiences for thousands of people, women and children in particular. In my opinion, it is precisely the protection of borders as well as efforts aimed at preventing the forging of documents allowing these borders to be crossed, that can pave the way for the effective reduction of the illegal cross-border transfer of people, of human trafficking. Although biometric passports give real cause for hope, the report does nevertheless indicate that a number of weaknesses exist relating to the protection and encoding of the data contained in such passports. For this reason, every effort should be made to improve technology and the ways in which these documents are used. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Thank you Mr President. The idea of introducing biometric passports was, among other things, to make it more difficult for our passports to be forged, and therefore make it easier for our citizens to travel. However, we all know that certain difficulties and problems have been identified even with biometric passports. That is why we presented this parliamentary question with the aim of asking the Commission to consider and investigate these problems in detail.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Today, we are studying the prospective solutions to these problems. I would like to state that our citizens find border control to be a very sensitive subject. Subjects such as illegal immigration, the illegal presence of people in Europe and the opening and closing of our borders evoke many strong sensitivities, and our citizens have repeatedly shown us that they want us to pay due attention to such matters. Parliament has very good experience in this regard, mainly in relation to topics such as Schengen, which involves the expertise of people like Carlos Coelho, and Frontex.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Biometric passports are another important part of this dimension of security, and it is therefore in our every interest to ensure that biometric passports are effective and that they cannot be tampered with. I feel that if we were to address the difficulties identified through these studies, then honest, law-abiding citizens who travel regularly will be able to enjoy the benefits we can achieve in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, after the adoption of standards for security features and biometrics in passports in 2004, Ireland’s first biometric passports, or e-passports, were issued in 2006. The introduction of e-passports was intended to ensure better protection against fraudulent use. Personal identification contained in the biometric chip of each e-passport establishes a more reliable link between the passport and its holder.</p>
      <p sl="en">The introduction was timely. In 2010 an investigation by the Irish police proved that eight Irish passports had been forged and misused by Israeli Government operatives in the assassination of Palestinian Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. It seems likely that the passports in question were forgeries of passports issued before 2006, as the biometric data in our passports is very difficult to forge.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, passports from other EU countries were also implicated in the cases I mentioned above.

In 2009 Parliament adopted Mr Coelho’s report on biometric passports with these very goals in mind.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to the ‘one person, one passport’ principle, children would also have the right to have their own passports without having to be included on their parents’ passports any longer. That has the potential to be a more secure system. However it looks as if the ‘one person, one passport’ principle is de facto unfeasible or, in any case, not safe for children under 12, as it has been found that the fingerprints of children under six are not of a sufficient quality to enable their identity to be established with certainty.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to put an end to the unfounded allegations that there are between 500 000 and 1 000 000 false biometric passports in circulation in France.</p>
      <p sl="fr">France takes the risk of fraud in relation to identity documents very seriously. It does not treat crimes in this area lightly. At the initiative of its government, identity theft is a crime punished by a year in prison and a EUR 15 000 fine.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The terms of delivery of identity documents have been simplified, which has allowed the prefectures to release additional resources to combat this fraud. Thus, each prefecture has a designated fraud specialist. Moreover, the provisions for making the delivery of identity documents secure have been strengthened. For example, the supplied civil status information may be verified between government departments, as far as possible electronically, in order to reduce the risks of falsification. Some birth certificates are also provided on security paper. The same rigour is applied to proof of residence documents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Ministry of the Interior is committed to increasing the security of proof of residence documents via the insertion of a barcode. The traditional processing of an application for a document includes the authorised consultation of useful files, the comparison of all documents produced during previous applications for documents and any authentication of supporting documents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The security of the document issue process is also guaranteed by the fact that the applicant has to appear twice, first when they make their application, then again when they collect the document, along with the collection of two fingerprints. This is without mentioning the strengthened checks on the renewal of lost and stolen documents against the data kept by the prefectures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, France reports the issue, loss or theft of passports to international cooperation organisations, especially to Interpol, to prevent their use for fraudulent purposes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, France, like the rest of the European Union is committed …</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, concerns raised regarding the reliability and effectiveness of biometric passports in the European Union still persist, and we have not yet found a satisfactory solution, although passports have been used in various Member States for more than five years. The replacement of traditional paper passports with biometric documents, which have a built-in special chip containing biometric data unique to each individual, should have helped to ensure that passports were not counterfeited. The historic use of hundreds of thousands, some estimates say up to a million – this needs to be verified – biometric passports and the issue of such passports based on false or counterfeit documents, however, suggests that the minimum security standards for passports are not sufficient to ensure the authenticity of the document. Since this is a question closely related to internal security and order within the European Union, I support the introduction of stricter rules applying not only to passports themselves, but also to the general procedure for their issuance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this morning, here in Parliament, we passed the agreement between ourselves and the United States with regard to PNR, and that should help to make travel safer for everybody. It was disconcerting to hear earlier on that 10% of French passports are falsified – even though my colleague disagrees with this. Whatever the figure, it is nevertheless safe to assume that the vast majority of those in possession of falsified passports are probably criminals of one sort or another.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we can reduce the number of falsified passports we will make the world far safer and reduce an awful lot of the counterfeited goods and contraband, human trafficking and all sorts of terrorist activities. It was interesting that my colleague from Ireland, Ms Childers, pointed out that the falsified passports or the forgeries were prior to biometrics. Biometrics has a role to play and therefore we should do everything we can to make it safer and better for everybody.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, biometric passports are being introduced – we are after all dealing with a process – in order to make life harder for criminals and hinder their operations. It appeared that biometric passports were the most reliable way of achieving these aims. However, these passports are also being forged ever more effectively by criminals capable of tampering with passport chips and codes. Combating these practices is, of course, a task for police forces in individual countries as well as for border guards. I have to say, however, that in my opinion, the information provided today, including that supplied by the Commissioner, is very much lacking in facts and data regarding the efforts made in this area by two important institutions, namely Europol and Frontex, given that this issue should be one of their main priorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we had hoped that the new biometric passports would prevent forgeries and would therefore result in greater security. However, according to estimates, there are around 1 million biometric passports issued on the basis of falsified birth certificates circulating in France alone. These passports were introduced in 2004 following pressure from the United States, and they contain the biometric images and fingerprints of the holder. However, some of these fingerprints are unreadable according to a study carried out in the Netherlands. More than a fifth of the passports there were unusable. In the case of older people, and also children, it is even more difficult to incorporate fingerprints properly. All in all, biometric passports appear to be yet another expensive, dubious method from the United States for stepping up the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="de">The results of the three-year study have now been submitted and we will need to evaluate them thoroughly to see whether these biometric passports actually make any sense at the end of the day.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the public has found and continues to find it difficult to accept biometric passports. It is not easy for people to accept new things, especially if they are not adequately explained. Admittedly, although it seems to be a very secure system for identifying travellers, fraud does occur due to the availability of technologies and different devices that help hackers steal data from chips. People are afraid that, just like bank card details are stolen, it will also be just as easy for data to be stolen from chips featuring biometric passport content.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the public needs to be better informed about what a biometric passport is, as well as about the security features which it offers. The possibility must be looked into of creating in the future a system where the radio frequency-based ID device contained on the passport’s chip can be detected only by the relevant authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">In a way it is a bit unfortunate that we are having this debate today because in June I would be able to give you the answers to all the questions you have put to me. We will then have the reports and I will be happy to share the results with you; I am looking forward to having a renewed discussion when we have all this documentation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the question of false documents, we are of course aware of this problem. We have no confirmation of the figures that have been circulating here. I think they are wildly exaggerated, but of course it is a problem and we are in close contact with Europol and Frontex on this. As I said, right now we are conducting a study on identity theft in general, where this is an issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the regulation on biometric passports was adopted there was no evaluation clause in it, so the Commission has not been asked to do a general evaluation of the usefulness and effectiveness of biometrics.

      <p sl="de">Biometric passports are intended to prevent stolen or falsified passports from being used to commit a crime. Moreover, to support cross-border investigations, biometric data are intended to be entered into the Europe-wide, next generation police information system. The use of biometrics is intended to create an additional obstacle for forgeries. Of course, the technical support at border controls could be time-saving for travellers and border control officers. That is the theory, at least. In practice, experts consider passport biometrics to be an unsuitable means of fighting terrorism – the likelihood of someone slipping through unnoticed may even increase. Combating terrorism was, after all, one of the main reasons for introducing biometric passports. SIS II is still not working. Then there are more than enough countries with traditional passports that are easy to forge, not to mention the poorly guarded borders. However, it is precisely these that are misused for the purpose of illegal immigration. It seems that nothing much has changed with regard to the large difference in security standards within the EU, even with the introduction of biometric passports. Thus, we need to eradicate sources of error and the opportunities for forging passports and strengthen our border controls, particularly along the smuggling routes. For this, FRONTEX needs to be armed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the Council, too, for nevertheless managing to be here now. This is a really important and sensitive subject. It is therefore very important for us and this House to be able to have this debate with you today.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission intends to re-evaluate the Less-Favoured Areas during the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). In the report by Herbert Dorfmann in May 2010, we had already expressed huge concerns about the new calculation model. The proposal provides for the classification of Less-Favoured Areas according to eight biophysical criteria, such as low temperatures, aridity, soil conditions or slope of the land. The result of the new mapping is disastrous for many regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new criteria would result in massive redistributions in some regions. We have been told this by some Member States. The detailed calculations and simulations are not available to us, however. For the continuation of the negotiations on the CAP, in connection with which the European Parliament, as legislator, will have to take a decision on this matter, all of the facts must be made available to us. We will do everything we can to prevent sensitive regions which are clearly affected by natural handicaps from disappearing from the map. What data can the Council provide and when will Parliament receive all of the simulations? As representative of the Member States, the Council must ensure that Parliament does not have any gaps in its knowledge. Parliament wants and intends to find good solutions for farmers during the CAP negotiations. Until all of the data have been provided, we reserve the right to leave the issue of Less-Favoured Areas out of the reform completely.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hereby ask you to take this House and its concerns seriously. I am calling for planning security for our farms and programmes that enable our holdings to make a living. Our main point of criticism is the fact that the delimitation of individual holdings according to the type of production they employ is no longer to be possible. We want a bundle of criteria. When it comes to maintaining agriculture in areas in which conditions are difficult it is important to recompense for the total capacity. It is important to recognise the services provided in the public interest and to appreciate our agriculture which is found throughout all of the regions of Europe. It is a question of preserving our rural cultural heritage. We expect specific answers from you today.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Bødskov, ladies and gentlemen, the need to ensure agricultural activity in rural areas is a matter worthy of consensus from us all. We want to preserve biodiversity, we want to prevent forest fires, we want better water management and we want better soil protection. It is not, therefore, the idea of this type of support that we are debating here today; what we are debating here today is very practical in nature. We Members, who are currently invested with the responsibility of drafting reports on common agricultural policy reform, will have to make decisions; will have to legislate without a bare minimum of information on the real impact of applying new criteria to an area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By now, the Council should already have informed us; the Member States should already have made available all information on the real impact of these new criteria on each of the Member States. I should therefore like to ask the Council the following question: is it in a position to provide this information and, if so, when? I should also like to remind you that the rapporteurs will submit their work for translation within a month and that it will be practically, nay actually, impossible to legislate responsibly if this information is not available.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, since responsibility for this area is in the hands of the Member States, I should very much like the Council to tell us very clearly and specifically when it will be in a position to provide us with this information that is essential for our work as lawmakers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Less-Favoured Areas scheme is of vital importance, certainly to my region in Northern Ireland. Currently 70% of agricultural land in the region is designated as a Less-Favoured Area. The payments received by farmers who are covered by this scheme are vital to their livelihoods, especially as many are only part-time farmers.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should therefore approach adopting this scheme – and changing the criteria for limiting the scheme – with the utmost caution. Forecasts suggest that, under the current proposals, a substantial amount of currently eligible land in the United Kingdom as a whole will lose LFA status. This figure is thought to translate into a loss of up to 30% of current LFA land.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am concerned that, while some areas may lose out, it seems in fact that more productive land could well be included under this new scheme. These are areas which may not necessarily require this type of support; this demonstrates that, quite possibly, the Commission failed to carry out an adequate impact assessment of the consequences of this proposed notification.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to see a level playing field for all Member States. This requires the recognition of all types of natural constraints, and of the fact that they are equally damaging to agricultural production. I would like to take this opportunity to point out, for example, that rainfall – as experienced where I come from – can be as detrimental to agricultural activity as the droughts which occur in other parts of Europe. We have to overcome the obstacles and a one-size-fits-all approach will not suit on this occasion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to safeguard the effectiveness of the LFA scheme, I wish to see a broad and flexible approach. I believe that the current scheme has worked very well, and I do not wish to see it in any way jeopardised.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I am beginning to wonder who exactly is driving the CAP and the reform. Is it the Commission or is it the Court of Auditors? It seems that the Court has criticised the Commission’s every move, even, this week, regarding the reform package. If this specific reform of the LFA scheme proposed by the Commission is simply a reaction to criticism from the Court of Auditors which claims these payments are not justified, it is totally scandalous.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in Scotland some 85% of farmland is currently designated as LFA, so it was with some trepidation that we awaited the outcome of the first new mapping exercise using the new biophysical criteria. Under the original map, there were significant areas of Scotland that would have dropped out under the new designation, but thankfully that has been rectified – to a certain degree – by the Commission’s inclusion of excess soil moisture, i.e. the amount of rainfall that actually falls on land, being included. That has helped to iron out some of the anomalies revealed in the original mapping exercise in Scotland, although there are still some serious problems with regard to the amount of good land that has been brought in, especially on the east coast of Scotland, and I think that most independent analysts would recognise that this was not genuinely less-favoured or disadvantaged.</p>
      <p sl="en">At least in the United Kingdom we have had a clear idea of how the new criteria impact on UK farmers and on Scottish farmers, as the maps showing the changes have been published by both the UK and Scottish Governments on a regular basis and consulted upon. However, in many other countries – as other Members have said – they are keeping the impact of these changes a secret and are refusing to give the Commission permission to release the information to the European Parliament. How can we decide whether the new LFA criteria set out in the CAP reform are appropriate and meet the criticisms of the EU Court of Auditors, when key information such as this is being deliberately withheld from Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development?</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say to the Council here today that this is a matter of principle, and – as co-legislators – Parliament must have the same access to the same information as both the Commission and the Council. The countries concerned must come clean and reveal this information to us as soon as possible if the legislation is to make any progress through this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries is, unfortunately, unable to be here today, so, on behalf of the Danish Minister and the Presidency, I will answer questions 70 and 71 concerning delimitation of Less-Favoured Areas in the context of the reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="da">In connection with its work to obtain an understanding of the precise impact of the application of eight biophysical criteria used to designate Less-Favoured Areas, the Commission asked the Member States to produce maps of particular areas. These are areas that will be eligible to receive Less-Favoured Area payments on the basis of simulations of the application of the criteria.</p>
      <p sl="da">I understand that Parliament wanted the detailed maps to be distributed. Unfortunately, that has not yet happened.</p>
      <p sl="da">The question of new criteria for the designation of Less-Favoured Areas is now being included in the reform of the common agricultural policy. Nevertheless, no official information has yet been presented concerning the impact of the application of the eight biophysical criteria. I agree with the authors that both Parliament and the Council should have access to the same basic information concerning the impact of the application of the biophysical criteria for the designation of land that is eligible for subsidies in areas with severe limitations for agricultural production.</p>
      <p sl="da">As far as I am aware, all Member States have now submitted provisional information and maps concerning the impact of the application of the eight biophysical criteria to the Commission. Even if this information and these data are provisional, they will provide useful information on the impact of the application of the new criteria, which may be relevant to both the Council’s and Parliament’s understanding of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, the Council does not have access to this information and these maps. The maps belong to the Member States and they can only be made available to Parliament and the Council once the Member States have given the Commission permission to distribute them. The Commission is not able either to publish or to distribute this information without permission.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am given to understand, however, that 12 Member States have now agreed to grant the Commission permission to provide information on the impact of the application of the eight biophysical criteria for the designation of Less-Favoured Areas in these 12 Member States. This will happen at the meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on Monday, 23 April.</p>
      <p sl="da">Despite this cooperativeness, I also understand and share the authors’ surprise at the lack of disclosure and transparency in relation to this information. At the most recent meeting of the Special Committee on Agriculture on 16 April 2012, the Presidency therefore encouraged more Member States to reconsider their position and to grant this permission, so as to ensure that there is as much transparency as possible in this process. I hope that more Member States will now grant the necessary permission so that both Parliament and the Council can gain understanding of the impact of the proposed biophysical criteria.</p>
      <p sl="da">On account of this situation, the Council is unfortunately not able to make any further comments on the questions raised, and I therefore propose that any further questions concerning the details of this matter be directed to the Commission at the forthcoming meeting in Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which will take place on 23 April 2012.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, what is happening with regard to the new delimitation of less-favoured areas is, in truth, a bad joke, and I have the impression that the discussion this evening will do nothing to improve the punch line, either. We have just heard from the President-in-Office of the Council that the Member States and the Council are entirely different things. That is news to me.</p>
      <p sl="de">About two years ago, my report on this matter was adopted in connection with which we made many proposals here in Parliament, as has already been said today. Absolutely nothing from this report has been retained in the Commission’s reform proposal. The Commission is continuing on its own stubborn path. Above all, however, we still do not know what this new delimitation will mean. We do not know which areas will be removed or which new areas will be included. Please do not misunderstand me: it may very well be that there will be a better delimitation than the one we have today. If we see that some Member States are made up 100% of Less-Favoured Areas, that is entirely possible. However, it is a question of delimiting the right areas and not simply of delimiting as many areas as possible. In my view, the eight proposed criteria will not necessarily help us to do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above all, however, it is absurd that Parliament has still not seen the simulation of these criteria. While the Commission is claiming that it cannot release the maps because they belong to the Member States – as has just been confirmed to us – ministers of individual Member States are demanding that Parliament amend the criteria. How can we be expected to do that if we do not actually know the results of this? In fact, the only thing that is missing from this whole charade is for some Member States or the Commission to claim that Parliament is insisting on the new delimitation in this form. Then the confusion really would be perfect.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore urgently call on you as President-in-Office of the Council to proceed in a transparent way here and to put Parliament in a position to be able to do its job properly in the interests of the Council, the Commission and, most importantly, the farmers themselves.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is utterly astounding that we are to decide here on the future of the common agricultural policy, but have had essential criteria for this decision withheld from us. There is nothing to prevent a new delimitation of less-favoured areas being carried out. It is also acceptable to try to base this on fewer criteria than is currently the case. However, if these are to be limited to eight criteria, made up of climate-related and geological criteria, it is unacceptable for MEPs to be denied the opportunity to scrutinise whether these criteria are indeed appropriate. We need maps of the new distribution of less-favoured areas in order to be able to examine whether this new distribution based on the eight criteria makes any sense at all. However, the withholding of the map material will obviously arouse distrust as to whether there really is any desire at all to enable Parliament to exercise its right of codecision.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a farmer, I have serious doubts from a purely professional point of view as to whether these simple criteria will enable this sort of area classification to be made appropriately. There are, after all, other criteria that could convey disadvantage, such as a lack of infrastructure, labour market access or general historical farm structures. Moreover, different combinations of various criteria could lead to very different results. It is high time that we were able to evaluate the Commission’s proposals in an objective way in order to be able to improve them if necessary. Otherwise, I would agree with my fellow Members who wish to leave less-favoured areas out of the current agricultural reform discussion.</p>

It is a remarkable situation for us as the legislature to find ourselves in, and you as President to be defending.</p>
      <p sl="en">Less-favoured-area status is of crucial importance to vast swathes of European territory. In Scotland, as we have heard, 85% of our territory is less-favoured area, and for our farmers LFA reform is actually more relevant and more important than CAP reform in its totality. So this is crucial; this is not a subsidiary issue, it is absolutely relevant to how we manage our environment and how we produce food across vast swathes of European territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Scotland we have done our modelling and our mapping. We lose precisely 622 square km under the new criteria; we gain, according to the Farmers’ Union, 5 536 square kilometres, so we are proceeding on the basis of knowledge, facts, transparency and openness and all the things that the Scottish and Danish governments want to see.</p>
      <p sl="en">The idea that in this Chamber we are operating blind as to the implications of these new criteria for vast swathes of our territory is simply inexcusable and is not a basis on which we can proceed, so I too would back calls from colleagues for this information, the importance of which we identified in the Dorfmann report.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to support the concerns voiced in regard to the issue of the lack of maps. Without such documents we are, indeed, unable to deliberate in a rational manner. In my opinion, the criteria that should guide us when delimiting Less-Favoured Areas (LFA) should relate mainly to soil conditions. The humidity of the soil, which Mr Nicholson referred to, is a very important condition which needs to be taken into account. Similarly, conditions relating to labour intensity are also important. To put it simply, in some areas, much more work is required in order to produce crops, in comparison to other areas. Mountainous regions fall into this very category. Competitiveness is yet another relevant issue. We should take account of areas at a greater distance from market outlets, where additional costs have to be borne in order to sell produce or to source means of production. The aforementioned criteria should be the main ones used for the delimitation of less-favoured areas.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Parliament’s acquisition of the detailed maps required for the demarcation of underprivileged regions as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy is a crucial issue, for at least two reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is a question of respect. Our Parliament, the only Union institution with democratic legitimacy, must have all of the tools required for its legislative control function.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second reason is a matter of common sense with regard to Europe’s agricultural ambitions. If we wish for solidarity between the regions of the Union, if we want a quality agriculture that has broad autonomy in renewable resources, that is made local again, participating in consumer public health, contributing to the fight against global warming and satisfying the food needs of our populations, all forms of European aid have to be reconsidered in terms of these objectives. To do this, the detailed maps of the agricultural regions are indispensable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as many people have said in this debate, LFA is important. It is important to Northern Ireland. We have already heard that 70% of land in Northern Ireland is currently within the scheme. We had hoped that this debate would bring clarity, but this is certainly not the case and like others, Minister, I am embarrassed that you have come to this House with such flimsy information. As co-legislators in the CAP process, I would have to say that this is simply not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Farmers in Northern Ireland need to know the effect that this scheme and the new criteria will have. It is my understanding that land currently designated as disadvantaged will be excluded. In Northern Ireland we also want to be reassured that we will have regional flexibility on the administrative unit to be used in the designation of the new boundaries in this land.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also, I think, need to re-evaluate the start date for this scheme. Currently this is 2014, with payments on a degressive basis until such time as the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme is completed. We need to look at all these aspects.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, as far as the impact maps are concerned, I could say, if this was not such a serious issue, that the whole matter is becoming more and more like a comedy show. You are claiming in all seriousness that there are Member States sending maps to the Commission, while in the Council they are saying that these maps are not intended to be published or passed on to the European Parliament. That is simply incomprehensible. Up to now, I believed that the European Council was made up of the sum of the Member States. Is there are two-part working system here, where the Commission receives maps that are then intended to be kept confidential? I simply cannot understand this. It would, in my view, help to build trust if we could at least receive the Member States’ maps that the Commission is in possession of. How to actually get hold of these impact maps is indeed the most closely guarded secret in the European Union. They are being treated in a very precious way, like very expensive shares. This cannot be the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think the drawback with the Commission’s proposal is that it is not just a question of the physical soil conditions, but also of the yield capacity of the soil. We must not carry harmonisation in the European Union to the extreme. Conditions in the EU are much too varied for this. I would therefore argue in favour of us discussing the less-favoured areas once again calmly and objectively, without any time pressure. That means that we should not do this within the framework of the agricultural reform, but in a separate report, precisely because we will have no time pressure, because the situation is so confusing, because we should not allow this issue to get lost in the huge ocean of agricultural reform, and because we are talking about less-favoured areas here.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not about who is right. In my opinion, it is simply about the farmers affected and their families and incomes. We should therefore give ourselves the time that we need to discuss and take a decision on this problem properly.</p>

You yourself – if I have read this correctly – are a young farmer operating in the crisis-hit region of Mecklenburg and have gained your first experience there. This is just pasture land with only 20 soil points and a situation that means it can truly be classed as a less-favoured area. I would therefore like to ask you: what impact do you think this will actually have on our farmers in particular in the less-favoured areas?</p>

      <p sl="de">blue-card answer. – Perhaps the reason why the maps are being treated as classified documents is quite simply that certain things could emerge that it is just not possible to explain in terms of common sense and professional practice. For example, I recently had a group of visitors from the Eifel region. They had the same conditions, the same agricultural expectations and the same soil points, and yet half of the region is suddenly no longer classed as less-favoured. It is not possible to explain this, and it is not the way to pursue European policy. I think that if the Member States are afraid to give us the maps then I no longer know how we are expected to continue with the process. I am simply calling for transparency and honesty here.</p>

      <p sl="es">Secondly, in May 2010 Parliament ruled on this issue of Less-Favoured Areas and we raised and considered the point then that purely biophysical criteria were not suitable for the EU framework as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="es">Accordingly, I wish to reiterate today the opportunity for studying the incorporation of socioeconomic criteria because there are many rural areas in the EU that at the moment are doomed to disappear altogether on account of depopulation.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the issue of Less-Favoured Areas is of great importance to European agriculture, with just over 50% of the utilised agricultural areas in the EU classed as less-favoured. In my own Member State, Ireland, the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of the total land in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">From an economic perspective, the less-favoured area scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100 000 Irish farming families whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and in particular the impact of the prevailing wet, cold climatic conditions in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Farmers making a living in less-favoured areas face additional hurdles in trying to make a fair return for fair work. The market does not respect nor take into account the additional and costly challenges facing farmers in areas at a natural disadvantage. In this regard we must be sure that LFAs under Pillar 2 are adequately financed within the overall CAP budget and that the principle of subsidiarity is upheld, and that Member States are given the utmost flexibility to utilise the criteria in a manner that works best for their farmers and that they have the freedom to fine-tune it so as to best serve rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that Member States have been facing delays in the preparation and submission of the maps of areas that would be eligible for less-favoured area payments and, judging from today’s debate, it would appear that some Member States have refused to hand over these details. The process for delimiting and classifying these areas is proving problematic for some areas. Perhaps in this regard the Commission could give an indication, assistance or direction to Member States, to speed up the process.</p>

Supporting active farming in these areas delivers a wide range of benefits, not least of which is the sustainable management of the landscape resulting in amenity enjoyment for hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The whole process of negotiating the new common agricultural policy is a sword of Damocles hanging over farmers.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the Commission proposed a long time ago to reassess the delimitation of Less-Favoured Areas on the basis of biophysical criteria. However, no information has been made available to date on the process under way, which becomes particularly important when Parliament is debating the future common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
      <p sl="pt">Identifying less-favoured areas is absolutely key to realising the European agricultural model represented by the CAP, since it establishes support levels on the basis of positive discrimination, so as to make agricultural production viable and promote it throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This will also ensure rural areas’ viability and prevent land from being abandoned or depopulated. At the same time, it is important that the evaluation of Less-Favoured Areas – to be undertaken on the basis of simulations carried out by the Member States – be fairly detailed, whilst ensuring a high level of subsidiarity when setting out criteria that must be socioeconomic as well as biophysical, considering limits at levels that suit the characteristics of each Member State, and respecting the specificities of each region thereof.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The established criteria should also consider the possibility of cumulative biophysical characteristics, combining physical criteria, such as soil and climate, with geographical ones, such as isolation and distance, as well as production, pasture proportion, herd density, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regrettably, the Commission proposal totally fails to mention geographical disadvantages, such as isolation, farm dispersal, distance from consumption centres, or distance from decision-making and services centres. These issues are very important in a country like Portugal, whose territory comprises an area in the far west of the European mainland and two outermost regions – the Azores and Madeira – in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.</p>

My fellow Members have already mentioned all the important arguments; I find this situation absurd. In my home country, and in the narrower region from where I come, that is, the Sand Plateau of the Danube–Tisza interfluve in central Hungary, classified by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as a semi-desert, farmers cannot tell whether their region will now be considered a Less-Favoured Area or not, despite the fact that without irrigation they will be unable to make a living.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to express my concerns at the consequences of some of the Commission’s proposals to reclassify less-favoured areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the United Kingdom these areas are some of the most beautiful and biodiversity-rich parts of the country. But they are also areas which are most vulnerable, and indeed these are the areas where common agricultural policy support is a vital lifeline for the livelihoods of the people living and working there. As ever, detail and implementation will be critical.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge the Commission therefore to consider three points. The first is that they adopt a 50% UAA threshold as a standard qualification; secondly, that they use the smallest size of administrative unit in order to reflect more accurately the area’s agricultural potential; and, finally, that they show a degree of flexibility in the way that natural handicaps and biophysical criteria are measured in order to classify the area.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to avoid desertification and preserve the prosperity of our territories, the new text presented to us by the Commission gives Member States the opportunity to provide greater support to farmers in areas subject to natural limitations through a supplementary allowance. This aid will be added to the funds already available under the rural development policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Five per cent of the budget is assigned to farmers with land falling in Less-Favoured Areas, with a bonus of up to EUR 300 per hectare. However, the issue that is really worrying farmers is the definition of Less-Favoured Areas. The eight biophysical criteria may not make for a reasonable and understandable delimitation and do not seem to respond to the interests of farmers or tax-payers. The proposed thresholds are too rigid and the results do not meet the desired objectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">I maintain, furthermore, that measures similar to those set out in Article 68 on helping vulnerable sectors or regions ought to be retained. Aid for vulnerable sectors should however be restricted in order to avoid distortions of competition. Here I am referring, for example, to the cultivation of ‘monumental’ plants such as olive trees in Apulia, southern Italy. Following the reform, it has been forecast that the olive-growing sector would lose 60% of its value against previous levels. The longevity of monumental olive trees is of huge importance for the region, including in ecological, economic and productive terms: ecologically, it is important because keeping these crops healthy and productive means carrying out work on hydrogeological defence works in areas subject to erosion; in economic and productive terms it is important because it represents one of the region’s main revenue streams, since in Apulia alone there are 1 200 oil mills working 53 varieties of olives of undeniable value and quality.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, we are asking the Commission to put alternative, suitable thresholds into its proposal on biophysical criteria and to make it possible for these criteria to be used cumulatively, with physical and geographical criteria added to other production-related criteria.</p>

We most definitely need a criterion that takes socio-economic situations into account as well. We need to view rural areas as common living and economic areas. Bare figures concerning the weather and soil conditions will not be able to provide us with the data on which to base a decision.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the subject of compensation payments that we are debating today is a very important one for our farmers in the areas concerned. I would like to point out here that the compensation payments are a success story in European agricultural policy. They have helped the management of the land to continue throughout these areas, where the biodiversity of the cultural landscape has been safeguarded and the jobs of people in these areas have been retained. This has meant that people in these areas continue to have prospects.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore find the way that the Commission as well as the Council have dealt with this sensitive matter even more incomprehensible. If we consider these eight biophysical criteria, we see that we will gain new inequities that are significantly worse than those under the current system, in which there are a few delimitation problems. We would have a system that would probably cause a great deal of anger. Details have leaked from Germany indicating that 2.8 million hectares would be removed and 1.2 million new hectares would be included in their place. When I speak to farmers from these areas, they are surprised that they should suddenly be in a Less-Favoured Area. From France, we hear that an area where farmers have the highest average income is to become a less-favoured area. This just does not add up.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to work with Parliament in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon so that we can draw up better proposals. Sometimes all I can say, with a certain amount of irony, is: I think as Parliament we need to make a few copies of the Treaty of Lisbon available to the Council and the Commission so that they finally catch on in all areas that this Treaty exists. It appears that many of them are not yet aware of this. Since the whole business really does already resemble a comedy show, as Mr Jahr put it, I would like to make another suggestion.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite the significant efforts made by the services of the Commission and of the Member States to develop a method of delimiting areas with natural handicaps, the proposed biophysical criteria do not meet basic expectations, namely the objective delimitation of areas of factual natural handicaps across the entire Union. There is clearly insufficient justification for the adoption of LAU 2 as the administrative unit to be used as the basis for qualification, given that the size of this unit varies widely across the EU. For the Union as a whole, the average size of an LAU 2 unit amounts to 3 500 hectares. In Poland, however, the average size is 12 500 hectares. In the case of some Member States, there can even be a tenfold difference in the size of LAU 2 units. This situation does not allow comparability on a EU level. In my opinion, small administrative units such as cadastral units should be used. These are uniform in terms of soil conditions and consequently provide a better representation of natural impediments. Moreover, the application of the LAU 2 level in conjunction with the high qualification threshold, namely 66%, especially in countries with a variety of soil and climatic conditions such as Poland, will result in the exclusion of some areas with natural handicaps in situations where the required level in terms of qualifying criteria is not reached.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of Poland, areas with scientifically proven low productivity and the risk of set-aside would not fall within the category of areas with natural handicaps. This indeed is turning things upside down and, before it is too late, we should exclude this issue from the reform of EU agricultural policy currently under discussion. Thank you.</p>

I come from Finland, and we still have a metre of snow in the country, while in central Europe the countryside is already starting to turn green.

      <p sl="pt">I should like, first of all, to mention the context of this debate. By excluding socio-economic factors, the recategorisation of the less-favoured areas proposed in 2005 is harmful to some of the poorest regions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Clearly, small and medium-sized farmers and family farming are hit even harder. The European Commission insists on using a number of means to deny them the role that they must play in the future of European farming. This has subverted the concept of the less-favoured area. The current definition ignores an entire dimension other than the biophysical: the socioeconomic dimension. This dimension cannot be ignored, at the risk of exacerbating even further the existing inequalities and injustices in distribution of common agricultural policy (CAP) funds between countries and producers. It is therefore necessary, not just to retain, but to expand and diversify socioeconomic criteria in terms of, inter alia , indicators of desertification and rural flight.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission has appointed a panel of experts to define biophysical criteria, but it forgot to include representatives of the various Member States therein; it should have, as it acknowledged in a question that I asked it in 2010. No expert from any Portuguese institution was included in this panel, and that is true for the overwhelming majority of Member States. The dangers are obvious. The diversity of existing situations means that the complexity of setting out uniform criteria could, once again, result in some benefiting at the expense of others.</p>

We cannot accept having to make decisions and state our position without having the same information that you have. Indeed I, as rapporteur for the reform of the common agricultural policy, refuse to accept it.</p>
      <p sl="it">The impact on the first pillar and on direct payments of the portion for Less-Favoured Areas cannot be simulated without the data.

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, I come from Slovenia and this is extremely important to my country. These maps describing natural agricultural handicaps are of the utmost importance. However, I would like to take this opportunity to support those members who argue that in defining these areas, biophysical criteria are not enough, and that socio-economic criteria also need to be considered when determining these areas.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Yet within that, I would like to highlight something which has still not been addressed today: the serious demographic problem we have in the European Union and the shortage of young farmers involved in agricultural production is one of the biggest problems facing the future of European agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I recently had a public debate on this issue in Parliament and it was revealed that only 6% of young people actively involved in agriculture within Europe are under the age of 35 – clearly this number is far too low. Therefore, I propose that the mechanism also include this type of criterion.</p>

That seems to be extraordinary, basically at the push of a pen. Thirdly, that information is available to the Council and so forth and it is not freely available to Parliament.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I am sure that most of us have bought locally produced potatoes, non-transported carrots or ‘zero mile’ cheese made at the local dairy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many people choose locally produced produce in the belief that it is healthy and better for the environment. However, what is actually classed as locally produced? We have no common understanding of the concept, nor any common criteria.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Does it relate to distance within national borders? If a school in southern Sweden buys potatoes from Denmark 20 kilometres away, are they classed as locally produced? How about if the same school buys the potatoes within Sweden, but from 2000 kilometres away?</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need established production methods. Do all of the ingredients have to be local? Everyone currently has their own view, and there is a big risk of consumers getting confused and being misled.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many consumers are prepared to pay more for locally produced products, but does such food always provide added value when it comes to nutrition and quality?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many people believe, for example, that they are making climate-smart purchases when they choose meat that is locally produced. Transport pollutes the environment, but when it comes to meat in particular, we know that the production method is actually more important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We cannot take it for granted that locally produced and locally grown products are always better for the environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Ladies and gentlemen, we have a responsibility to initiate the debate based on facts and, with the Commission’s help, to draw up guidelines for the concept of ‘locally produced’.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must focus on good food for our children, the elderly and the sick. We must improve conditions for small businesses and promote thriving rural areas, while at the same time safeguarding an open and common market and avoiding unhealthy food protectionism.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This issue is particularly relevant right now when we are reviewing the rules for public procurement. What would it mean if everyone in the EU requested special rules for local procurement?</p>
      <p sl="sv">The challenge is to create balanced rules that enable local procurement without compromising free trade and fair competition. That is why I have taken the initiative and asked the Commission to clarify what is meant by the term ‘locally produced’ food.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, consumers experience a great deal of uncertainty when they go into shops and see a locally produced product. No one knows what that actually means. Does it actually come from somewhere local or is the yoghurt that is claimed to be local perhaps produced using milk that had first been transported a thousand kilometres? Is that what we as consumers want?</p>
      <p sl="de">It is time that we clarified what is actually meant by the term ‘locally produced’. Many citizens would like to know that. This is not because they want to pursue food nationalism, but because they take protection of the climate and the environment seriously, and they say: these natural products that I am buying today do not need to come from a long distance away when they can also be produced locally, and I would prefer that. These things are important. We want clarity so that responsible citizens can also take responsible decisions. After all, what does it mean to be able to take responsible decisions? It means receiving the information that you need to formulate the decision accordingly. These are things that we need to clarify.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has, in fact, started to consider this matter. I would be very grateful, Commissioner, if you could tell us by when we can expect action to be taken by the Commission. When will we potentially also have legislative proposals on the table with which we will be able to provide citizens with an answer to these pressing questions? It is not a question of preventing products from coming from other countries. I always look forward to the delicious products from Spain that I can buy in Germany, because they cannot be produced in Germany. However, there are also products that are produced locally. It is important for us to ensure that citizens know where a product comes from, what the quality of the product is, and that there is not always a riddle associated with it in terms of how the information should be interpreted, what the quality label that they see means, and whether it actually has any value or any real meaning. This is the legal certainty that we want for our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission has been following the discussions and developments concerning local products and products that are locally produced in the Member States with a great deal of interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the level of the European institutions, the discussion on local products and food production systems opened in various fora: in Parliament, the Council, and as part of the ‘quality package’ and the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). In its opinion of January this year on food production systems, the Committee of the Regions called for a new European instrument specifically designed to select and promote local food products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission services have taken a number of initiatives, including consulting with Member States and stakeholders in order to gain a better understanding of the issues surrounding short food supply chains, a study of food short supply chains, which is under preparation, and the formation of a group of experts within the qualified advisory group to advise the Commission on short food supply chains and local products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has also launched the ‘quality package’ and has undertaken to analyse this issue. Work has begun. If necessary, and to the extent that the participation of the European Union is justified, we will be able to launch a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the Commission will organise a conference entitled ‘Local agriculture and short food supply chains’ on 20 April, which should provide more answers to the questions producers and consumers have on local products. Ms Gebhardt and Ms Corraza, as you say, there is no definition of the terms ‘locally produced’ or ‘local products’ at EU level. It is, therefore, not possible to answer consumers’ questions on distance, quality, production method, ingredients and origin of products. If need be, Member States have the responsibility to define these terms. Under European legislation on the provision of food information to consumers, clear and correct information should be provided by producers and retailers in order to avoid misleading consumers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to the initiatives I have mentioned, the results of which will be taken into consideration, the Commission services are continuing to analyse the issues surrounding short food supply chains and local products. The aim is to determine the merits of the additional actions at EU level in order to meet the needs of consumers for information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the risks concerning the operation of the internal market, any action by Member States must comply with the provisions of the Treaty including, of course, those concerning the free movement of goods and services.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Ms Corazza Bildt and the other Member for the fact that this subject is on the agenda. Not everything is certain, but a hundred years ago we had almost exclusively local production, and products were brought to market in their local area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, the situation is quite different. I have here an interesting announcement from the German Federal Ministry of Agriculture, which has discussed precisely what the Commissioner was just saying, namely that it is already possible to entertain regional showcases and regional origin. According to the statement, the Federal Minister for the Economy Ilse Aigner is looking to launch regional labelling in Germany at a Federal/Länder summit in April. She says that she is now going to bring forward an initial plan for a new regional showcase for food packaging. The aim would be to put in place clear and transparent labelling for regional products. The labelling is to be voluntary initially, and will aim to make the origin of the product and the most important ingredients transparent.</p>
      <p sl="de">The results of a survey are also interesting. Seventy-nine per cent of consumers are prepared to pay more for regional foods, but only 17% feel reliably informed about the origin of regional foods. Herein lies the major problem, therefore. According to one survey, 83% of respondents in Germany already pay attention to which region a foodstuff comes from. There then follows an interesting statement: according to the Minister, there is no requirement either for a new national legal basis or for notification via the Commission in order to for such a regional showcase to be introduced. In other words, the Member States already have the latitude to act in this way. Nonetheless, the Commission needs to provide greater clarity in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, globalisation entails costs which must be taken into consideration; at the same time, it is necessary to meet the obligations governing international trade and exchange. I am therefore convinced that setting standards for what is produced locally should take into account, in particular, the kilometres separating the production site from the point of sale and the point of consumption.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that the setting of standards should ensure that due regard is given to the costs of these external factors. A new criterion is therefore required to define what could be labelled as ‘locally produced’. This criterion should take account of socially sustainable production processes aimed at selecting local products evaluated on the basis of the behaviour of the producer and the method of working. The impact on public health and consumer safety, that is to say all the elements having a direct effect on our economy and on sustainable development, should also be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important to include all these criteria in our commercial semantics. We will guarantee the development of the regional and European economy and trade. On this matter, I have also decided, at this stage, to ensure greater consistency in public procurement – in the report for which I am rapporteur in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection – by establishing a preference for local products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to say that, as regards food, it is necessary to make a distinction between origin and provenance, enable food to be labelled more clearly – this is already the case and is ongoing – and indicate, in the case of animals, where they were reared, slaughtered, consumed and sold. This is very important, because origin and provenance are two entirely different things, and the consumer must not be misled.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Thank you for your question, Mr Jahr. The reality, Commissioner, is that the Commission, too, needs to consider whether we do not need to lay down other criteria. I had an experience a few years ago, where I had to fight in the Commission in order to help a Bavarian slaughterhouse to survive. What did the Commission official over there have to say about it? He said, ‘Well, it’s no problem if it closes, there’s another slaughterhouse 60 kilometres away in Austria.’ We cannot promote regional products with that mindset. There therefore needs to be a broad-based change of attitude so that regional products, too, can be offered. In addition, we need the Commission to reconsider a few pieces of legislation that play a part in ensuring that this is no longer possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, globally an estimated 80% of food is currently produced and marketed at local level. In the European Union, this figure is about 20%. It is clear that shortness of food supply chains is not the solution for dealing with the wider issues of guaranteeing food security and meeting the challenge of feeding 9 billion people by 2050. That said, shorter food supply chains do have an important role to play in the future CAP, and it is certain that clearer guidelines are needed without adding increased bureaucracy for farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">We already have a wide range of labels, such as PDO, PGI and TSG, so it is not necessarily the case that further specific labelling on this is needed. However, consumers are bombarded with so much information these days that it should at least be made clear what exactly they are buying when they buy locally-produced food.</p>
      <p sl="de">‘Local’ is a very flexible term as it means different things, in terms of distance, to different people. The basic idea that should be kept in mind about local food is simple: local food is produced as close to home as possible. Local food integrates production, processing, distribution and consumption on a small scale, creating sustainable local economies and a strong connection between farm and table.</p>
      <p sl="de">In a wider context, a criticism of the CAP which I come back to time and time again is that the added value of European agriculture is not fully appreciated further along the food supply chain and to a certain degree by the consumer. In this regard, locally-produced food, local markets, direct engagements with producers and on-farm business, leading to shorter distribution channels, have the potential to generate greater interaction, understanding and knowledge between consumer and producers. The future CAP must be a policy that welcomes and supports innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in their locality and also supports efforts to increase engagement with consumers and European taxpayers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, let me make a statement of fact: our citizens increasingly want to find and consume locally produced and seasonal food, for health and quality reasons in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to find ways to enable farmers to meet this growing demand effectively and quickly. We have to support the establishment of local infrastructure for producers, such as maintaining local abattoirs which, while guaranteeing rigorous sanitary control, facilitate the development of local short food supply chains and strengthen direct selling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Support for local agriculture and direct selling should help producers sell their products and bring them to the attention of consumers. Stronger direct relations will enable farmers to retain more of the added-value created on their farms. Direct selling within the farm must be promoted and facilitated and support must be given to the collective actions of farmers who want to open collective points of sale enabling them to offer local consumers a wider range of products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission must facilitate the emergence, sustainability and development of systems of selling through direct delivery to consumers, such as the Associations for the Preservation of Smallholdings (AMAP) in France, which enable approximately 3 000 farmers to supply 60 000 families.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in relation to Mr Bové’s statement and the previous interesting exchange of opinions between Mr Dess and Mr Jahr, I would like to say that in the report concerning animal transport, which I am currently working on and which will soon be the subject of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am placing a strong emphasis on the issue of local slaughterhouses, which should indeed be supported and developed. It is one of the ways of strengthening the idea of regional produce, and ensuring that such products are truly local and produced in individual regions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Returning to our core subject, we can observe that both across the world and in Europe a process is taking place whereby traditional agricultural production based on natural methods is being displaced by industrial agriculture. An ever-increasing part of agricultural production originates from large industrial farms. Natural agriculture based on family farms applying traditional methods of production is in decline. This is a very detrimental process that leads to a reduction in the quality of food, a deterioration of animal welfare conditions, negative environmental impacts and many other undesirable consequences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am strongly in favour of defining local produce as goods that are produced entirely within a given region, using traditional regional production methods that are environmentally friendly and promote animal welfare. This should be the criterion used for classifying such produce as locally produced goods. I cannot imagine a situation whereby meat products originating from a large industrial animal farm - such as those present in certain regions of Poland and managed by, for example, Danish businesses – would be regarded as local produce from a particular Polish region. Such a situation should not occur.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very evident that consumers are increasingly interested in purchasing products that are designated as ‘locally produced’, ‘produced nearby’, ‘zero-mile’ or described in a similar way. It is worth drawing attention to the need to develop explanations and a proper interpretation of the meaning of the frequently used term ‘locally produced’. This is because we must ensure transparency in this area and avoid deceiving consumers. We should devise definitions and criteria for the designation of locally produced food that would be a way of ensuring that consumers will always be in a position to make free and informed choices, based on clear and correct information.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this debate is very important and current. Present agricultural and trade policies have promoted models of intensive production for export, whilst laying waste to local production and small and medium-sized agriculture in countless countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These models are unsustainable and irrational, both environmentally and socioeconomically. They have reduced food diversity, made a number of countries more food dependant and contributed to the desertification of vast rural areas. As such, there is an urgent need to stimulate local production and consumption, thereby encouraging short supply chains, and reducing the energy flows associated with food production and distribution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Small and medium-sized agriculture plays a very important role in this, which it is important to recognise and value. All this requires a profound change to the current CAP and its market focus. Agriculture needs to be withdrawn from the World Trade Organisation.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, we asked you about ‘local produce’ labelling. Although there are binding European regulations protecting regional products, we are clearly lacking a definition of what can be presented as a local product, so that items imported from hundreds of kilometres away cannot be sold at popular famers' markets as local products. However, consumers are not misled only at farmers’ markets, which provide access to regional products from small farmers. I do not like the fact that Czech honey is on sale which originates from Turkey, or traditional Czech salami which originates from Poland.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We are therefore asking the Commission to propose, within the framework of its normative agenda, a definition of what can be presented and sold as a local product. This may look like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but it is not. The problem is universal throughout Europe, often affecting border areas, and tackling it through a European agreement on the definition of such labelling is therefore a good idea.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The ways of defining what is and what is not a local product may vary. It is farmers, above all, who should say, for example, if they wish to provide information on how far a product has travelled from the field to the customer, or the exact address of the place of production or other details. However, it is also possible to include other proposals for mandatory and at the same time verifiable details, which will help both buyers and inspection bodies quickly to tell where a product has come from. This will be appreciated not only by consumers, who will have certainty that products are from a given locality, but also everyone else, because it will also, among other things, reduce the number of long-haul lorries on Europe’s highways.</p>

It is clear that current labelling regimes are not satisfactory. Lax rules allow manufacturers to get away with completely misleading claims and undermine our consumers’ confidence and the right to choice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Products with long supply chains must not be allowed to be simply labelled as having been produced at the point of packaging when, as my colleagues indicated, nearby cross-border products would actually qualify as local under a labelling regime that is sensible and accurate, at least from a geographical point of view.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, consumers are increasingly interested in where their food comes from and how it is produced, especially with regard to issues such as country of origin, animal welfare and the environmental impact of food production. In reaction to this there is a growing trend for the Commission to legislate on labelling issues. I think the Commission has a genuine desire to ensure that consumers are better informed. However, let me be very clear: legislation on issues such as country of origin labelling has resulted in some very unwelcome side effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The text of this oral question mentions food nationalism, which I find to be a very appropriate phrase. Unfortunately producers and other actors in the food industry in some Member States have used this as an opportunity to develop schemes which are wholly protectionist. Consumers should be aware that this practice does not benefit them as it excludes competition, possibly leading to higher prices. These actions have a particularly serious effect on the agricultural economy and the regions which border other Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is beyond doubt that locally produced foods enjoy great popularity. However, the proportion of the total food market made up by these short-chain products should not be overestimated. This proportion remains very small. The future of European agriculture and food distribution also cannot lie in a general return to local market stalls and direct sales.</p>
      <p sl="de">The common agricultural policy has sought, in recent years, to promote the aggregation of farmers in the form of producer organisations and thus to develop a counterweight to the increasingly concentrated food retail industry. This necessarily brings with it longer supply chains. However, it is very much the case that individual businesses do offer short chains, and that is also something that consumers want. It therefore seems to me all the more important that the abuse of this consumer desire should also be prevented. The fact is that there is not currently any definition of what ‘local production’ is, and furthermore there is also a lack of general inspections; instead there are only voluntarily organised inspections by individual groups of direct sellers.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question also occurs to me, however, of whether it serves a purpose or indeed is possible to create European rules in this connection. The European panorama is diverse in this regard, and I think it makes more sense to leave this definition to the individual groups of suppliers, who then also communicate their rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is another point that I would just like to mention. With its protection of designations of origin, the European Union has created a very clear regulatory system for geographical designations. If we were to now attempt to authorise a new parallel regional system of designations, the result would be the construction of a parallel system and the irritation of consumers. The reality then would be the advent of a new form of parochial thinking on foodstuffs. Ultimately, that is not something we need.</p>

      <p sl="de">blue-card question. – I have a question for my fellow Member from the South Tyrol. You said that you do not place great value on short supply chains. My question then – and this is perhaps also of great interest to you – is whether you do not, in that case, also ascribe a significant contribution to the maintenance of the small-scale structure in the Alpine region to these small regional businesses with their short production chains. In other words, is it not precisely these direct-selling, small-scale businesses that, as a result of their ability to sell directly, also provide a survival opportunity for their businesses and their regions?</p>
      <p sl="de">As a second point, how would you prefer your bacon? Would you rather have bacon where the final processing takes place in the Tyrol, but the meat actually comes from Belgium? Or would you rather have bacon that is exclusively produced, slaughtered and made in the Tyrol?</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have revived an old debate. As much as I love bacon from South Tyrol, I have to say that bacon from the Kiskunság region of Hungary is also excellent. It would be most welcome if this debate did not serve the purpose of closing the gates of trade to each other, too. This debate, by the way, is redundant in a certain sense, because we have already had the same discussion in connection with quality policy. Let us also not forget the fact that the European Union is the world’s second largest exporter and largest importer of agricultural goods. Mr Dorfmann pointed out that local markets, local trade, and local processing have their own limitations. I, too, support them because they create jobs in agricultural regions and reduce transportation costs, but we should not delude ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It would be welcome if we could finally calculate in this House what it is that determines the actual environmental footprint of an agricultural product, because using large amounts of energy in greenhouses in the colder climate of Hungary does not necessarily have a smaller ecological footprint in vegetable production than if we were to import these goods from other continents, even if we include shipping costs. Let us renounce economic protectionism; we should support local production, but we can by no means stop global trade.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly concerned about knowing the origin of products, because I think consumers should not be left in a state of confusion, which is definitely important.</p>
      <p sl="it">Allow me to explain: in Italy we have a food culture that everyone is well aware of and we Italians often spend the weekends touring the countryside getting to know local products. Now, can you imagine how bad it would be for an Italian to arrive at a farmhouse restaurant to see goods with a well-known retail brand being unloaded from a refrigerated lorry? Let us now imagine that these goods were produced two kilometres away from the farmhouse. At this point, the unwitting consumer would leave confused, never to return there. The manager of the farmhouse would suffer, though maintaining in good faith that he had not done anything wrong. No court would accept a claim of food fraud, because no rule has been breached.</p>
      <p sl="it">In an economy like Europe’s, we cannot accept absurd situations like the one I have just described, because I think a regulation is needed, above all, to try and harmonise the system. In order to protect consumers and small farming and rural tourism businesses, I think we ought to provide a clear and precise definition of what local production means, which would apply across Europe. This is especially pertinent when talking about food, which is an issue particular dear to us, including in safety terms. Here it is not enough to apply by analogy the rules in force in other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="it">If I want to sample a local cheese, it is not enough that the final major processing phase is carried out locally, and we are fighting for this in other sectors as well. Rather, the animal that provided the milk for the product must have grazed on the grass of nearby fields. It must then have been milked in situ so that the animal did not have to go through any wearying journeys and the cheese must have been produced following absolutely strict rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is what we want for our consumers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity to hold this debate today – it is, after all, a very important one. It must be our objective to provide added value for consumers and, above all, for producers. I share the view that the terms ‘regionalism’ and ‘locally produced’ need to be clearly and comprehensibly defined.</p>
      <p sl="de">The discussion is altogether more comprehensive, however. Europe needs a re-think when it comes to foods and the entire foods sector. Short supply chains are perhaps one approach in that regard. However, we also need a common path via which everyone can move towards quality, transparency and certainty in production. We need a common path that has no negative impact on the livelihoods of farmers and the food industry. For me, the cornerstones of a foodstuffs model of this kind are certainty of origin for foodstuffs, the quality of foodstuffs, diversity and regionalism. Certainty in relation to foodstuffs must be the basic prerequisite for the definition of regionalism. In other words, certainty about the origin of a foodstuff. The most important thing here is that the country of origin of a foodstuff must be clearly visible to consumers.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the expanding supply of local produce is a specific response to the lack of confidence in the single market. Customers have doubts over the fair operation of the market and the quality of products, and they often have conflicting impressions as to the origin of products. Concern over cheating and imports of lower quality products leads customers to demand local produce which they consider more reliable in terms of quality.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is not just a matter of whether this really is true, but there is, of course, a need to clarify just what labelling can be placed on local produce. Producers and retailers often try to adjust to local habits and offer globalised food adapted to local taste preferences. They should rather, however, contribute towards confidence in the single market by offering products of the same quality throughout the EU, where products are so labelled. In my opinion, customers would value this at least as much as the offerings of local producers, where they still exist.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think there is a little bit of romanticism around this debate on local food. I am concerned that we would dare define this issue, so please let us be cautious on this. I come from a country – Ireland – where we are massive exporters of food. We appreciate local food but we want you across the European Union to regard Irish food as local because you are our customers.</p>
      <p sl="en">If our definition of ‘local’ is based too much on ‘near us’, I think we will destroy the internal market for food in the European Union and renationalise production to the detriment of agriculture in the Union. So I think we need to be sensitive to this issue and be very careful about what we mean. Could I also suggest that, rather than spoon-feed consumers, we let consumers take control themselves and ask questions. Perhaps that is a better way for consumers to get what they actually want.</p>

      <p sl="de">Thank you very much, Mr President. Commissioner, perhaps I can just endorse what Ms McGuinness had to say, as I view these things quite differently from the way in which you see them. I do not see this as protectionism, but as an ability and a duty to inform consumers. This is not – and I must contradict a fellow Member here – because I want to put a value on it. I am not saying that local or regional products are better. I just want to tell consumers that they can decide in an informed way whether they want a product from their own region, either because they are familiar with the conditions of production, or because they believe in having products on their dinner table that come from the local region for reasons of protecting nature and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I really do see this as a major opportunity for consumers to make informed choices to the benefit of the environment, informed choices to the benefit of jobs in the region, informed choice to the benefit of certain production methods, and I see absolutely no danger to the internal market, as I see precisely the major opportunity to make an informed choice in favour of Irish butter or Irish milk if that is what I want. However, if I want milk and cheese from the Forest Quarter of Lower Austria, then I need to know where products come from or else I cannot realise that freedom of choice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, we are, to some extent, agreed in this House that direct selling or the promotion of local products is, or can be, beneficial both for consumers and producers. It is clear that, in areas where agriculture is structured on a small-scale basis – such as in the Alps – direct selling by farmers is, to some extent, one of the few major opportunities to secure the survival of such small-scale farm holdings. On the other hand it is also clear that, in a world where consumers have industrially mass-produced foodstuffs to consume, this offers them an opportunity to also get hold of individual, environmentally healthy, natural foodstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, people have the impression that up to now the European Union has, if anything, put bureaucratic obstacles in the way of such locally-produced foods holding sway or continuing to be consumed. We should therefore be preventing false labelling, in order to prevent long-distance transportation and the like. We really should come up with a definition for local products. We should appreciate the protection of designations of origin. However, we should not regulate all this from the centre at European level.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate seems pretty absurd to me, since we are here discussing whether or not local production is something to be prized.</p>
      <p sl="it">Quite obviously, it is a core value that Europe is bound to promote and hold dear. We might discuss how to achieve it, but the fact that we have got to envisage a model for promoting local and traditional production is, in my opinion, inevitable.</p>
      <p sl="it">Local farming always fosters quality products, because fake or counterfeit products can get into distribution chains, while a local producer cannot counterfeit one of their own products, which they have a prime interest in selling. Likewise, traceability in this situation is not monitored by bureaucratic means but on a daily basis by the local producer and their customers, who trust in their local, neighbourhood producer. Moreover, the promotion of ‘zero-kilometre’ products is intrinsic to local, quality produce.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that this is a core value that Europe cannot but support, unless we want to turn our institution into one that talks about fakes and frauds but fails to consider the huge amount of value that is also created by practices handed down by generation upon generation, which is on its doorstep and represents a basic part of our agricultural output.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, regional and local produce is fortunately becoming increasingly important to consumers. Of course, this only presents a problem when everyone has a different understanding of what local produce is and when a variety of definitions and designations are used to identify the products. The question is whether ‘local’ means that the produce comes from within a few kilometres, from the same region or from the same Member State. It will be important to include in the quality package a clear, standardised definition of locally produced food. This must be based primarily on consumers’ expectations, in order to avoid misleading them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today I have repeatedly heard the bizarre criticism that the designation ‘locally produced food’ could result in food nationalism and goes against the spirit of the internal market, but I believe that this is simply absurd, because much of Europe’s added value comes from the variety of local and regional food producers. This variety and quality can be encouraged and protected by means of clear labelling.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a problem. Even if we agree on the definitions and criteria of locally produced food, we face one serious problem. Local products are often produced by small producers. The time and funds required to provide subsidies are so great that subsidies are unavailable in many cases. For most producers, it does not make sense to spend the energy, and subsidy policy actually penalises them. This puts them at a disadvantage, and I therefore consider such a subsidy policy to be one of the distortions of the common agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I tabled, as part of the debates on the product quality package, a number of amendments relating to the issue being discussed today. The debate then was about introducing a new European ‘Produced on my farm’ label, applicable to products sold directly from farms or in their vicinity, including at markets or via direct delivery to consumers. I think that this would be the best direction to follow in terms of coming up with a definition of local products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With regard to criteria such as the distance from the farm to the consumer or the production methods, I think that they are irrelevant. All that matters is the direct link between the producer and consumer. Local sale schemes offer benefits to producers who can receive a higher percentage of the end price, as well as to consumers who can enjoy fresh produce at affordable prices. The potential problem of food nationalism raised by the authors of the question is a red herring. What matters is price and quality, and if local products meet these conditions, consumers will buy them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, today’s debate is being held one year after the European agricultural quality policy was launched. As part of the CAP reform, this initiative supports preserving local culinary heritage in Europe. Specific regional features play a vital role in maintaining cultural diversity as a whole. Local networks and products reflect the traditions of the different areas of the European Union and support organic farming. In order to preserve this cultural resource, the definition of the term ‘locally produced food’ needs to be clarified. This debate is especially relevant in the case of food which is produced via a cross-border process. At the same time, the situation of the networks and products common to border areas is unclear. I would have liked to ask Commissioner Cioloş whether the geographical aspect will be the main element in this classification and against what reference point the distance used will be measured in granting ‘locally produced’ status.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for the debate. This clearly shows how engaged you, like many citizens, are in the issue of locally-produced food. There was a Eurobarometer survey which showed that nine out of ten respondents want to buy more locally-produced food and think that the EU should contribute to its promotion.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is important. However, it is very difficult to define what locally produced food is. It is also confirmed in the same Eurobarometer survey that many consumers feel a bit puzzled about this because there are so many different parameters, depending on the different countries and on the different traditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to address this, the Commission has taken five actions: consultation of Member States is going on; there is a study on its way; there is an expert group that is consulting the Commission; there is the quality package that the Commission has undertaken to look at; and there is this conference tomorrow on local agriculture and a short food supply chain. With all this and the ongoing work on the renewed CAP, I think these steps will bring more clarity on what locally produced food is.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The consumption of locally produced foodstuffs has several benefits, both for consumers and for the farmers producing them. These products offer a more reliable standard of quality for local consumers, because after all, the farmers’ own reputation is at stake, and purchase is often based in part on personal acquaintance. The products contribute to preserving the viability of the local rural economy, because revenues are used locally. Since they are sold mostly on local markets, directly by the farmers, they avoid food retailers and wholesalers who would otherwise take a disproportionate cut of the profit. What is more, local sale is also good for the environment, as the goods are not transported over hundreds, or sometimes even thousands of kilometres. This can help reduce CO2 emissions from the transport of agricultural products. One of the most important campaign promises of Fidesz was to support local small producers and local markets. The Hungarian Government has already made numerous significant achievements in this regard. According to the amendment of the public procurements act, for example, local producers must be given preference in the food procurement of schools, hospitals and other public institutions. In order to ensure the protection of local producers, however, we must define the criteria and labelling rules applicable to locally produced foodstuffs at European level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to support the question put to the Commission regarding the precise definition of the concept of ‘locally produced’ food, since the ambiguities included in product information affect both consumers and producers. People are becoming increasingly aware of the wide range of choice and quality on offer and consequently take more interest in the products they purchase. Organic food and a healthy lifestyle are becoming ever more popular. For this reason, local food is highly appreciated. Consumers should therefore be able to obtain reliable information regarding the place of origin of particular products. Producers, on the other hand, are keen to get a good return for their quality, local produce. We should, therefore, accurately define the method to be used by producers to designate the point of production of their goods, so that consumers can unequivocally recognise a quality brand. Product information should be clear and refer both to the region of origin as well as to the ingredients used in the production process. This will result in an improvement of the quality of food products and in more effective communication between producers and consumers.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In my opinion, what fully constitutes locally produced food is food to which no artificial preservatives have been added and which is delivered to the consumer while remaining in its original natural environment. Central state support for the production of locally produced food could result in the emergence of self-sufficient regions which could greatly contribute to job creation, and due to the health benefits of the consumption of these foodstuffs would radically cut the healthcare expenses of these regions in the long term. The packaging of these goods should be required to provide an exact indication of the place of origin of both the final product and the raw material at settlement level.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, honourable Members, there is no doubt that Greece is facing difficult challenges in the area of immigration, and it is absolutely vital that we support Greece by restoring its capacity to manage immigration.</p>
      <p sl="da">In the Council we have repeatedly discussed the implementation of Greece’s national action plan in the area of asylum and migration and in the area of border control, most recently at the Council meeting (Justice and Home Affairs) on 8 March this year. At this meeting, the Commission and Greece reported that a certain amount of progress is being made, for example in relation to the practical processing of asylum applications. However, it is also clear that enormous challenges still remain when it comes to implementation. These include ensuring that there is an adequate complement of staff to handle the cases and the establishment of the required number of reception centres. It is vital that all resources are utilised to improve the implementation of Greece’s action plan. This will involve a huge effort on the part of Greece itself and, in particular, a well-coordinated effort from the EU to assist Greece.</p>
      <p sl="da">It will be necessary to involve EU agencies, such as our joint European Asylum Support Office and Frontex, and those Member States that are able to help. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will also play an important part here in terms of providing financial resources, expertise and other practical assistance. In this connection, it is good that, according to information received, there are plans to set up new reception centres in the Evros region. In a moment I will hand the floor to the Commissioner, who will be able to tell you more about the subject of migration in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that, in the Council, we have discussed how we can show solidarity with Member States whose asylum systems are under particular pressure. On 8 March, therefore, the Council adopted a set of Council conclusions on a common framework for genuine and practical solidarity towards Member States facing particular pressures on their asylum systems, including through mixed migration flows. The central element of this solidarity framework is the idea of an early warning, preparedness and crisis management mechanism within the Dublin Regulation. This mechanism has now been included in the amendment to the Dublin Regulation, which we have just sent to Parliament with a view to initiating trialogue negotiations. This mechanism provides us with a starting point to enable us to anticipate situations like the one we are seeing in Greece. At the same time, we will have the tools to assist the country in question should the situation arise.</p>
      <p sl="da">There is agreement in the Council concerning the value of strengthening the Schengen cooperation and control of the external borders. The Council is also in agreement about strengthening the role of the EU agencies and cooperation with third countries, as well as promoting effective and proper expulsions. The agencies in particular are vital for strengthening solidarity by increasing their practical cooperation. The Presidency firmly believes that solidarity is an important principle, which must be implemented in the form of genuine and practical cooperation. With this general starting point of solidarity, we will, of course, maintain our focus on the situation in Greece and the implementation of the action plan.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Council supports the implementation of the action plan and is in favour of a well-coordinated effort, and I am pleased that Parliament has taken up this subject here today, as, in this area too, Greece’s challenges are the EU’s challenges. A reform of Greece’s asylum and migration system and well-managed border control are not only important for the EU and Greece, but also for migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for the opportunity once again to discuss this very important issue concerning migration management shortcomings in Greece, which is linked with the ongoing discussions on the Common European Asylum System and also concerns the fundamental rights of individuals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been continuously supporting Greece’s efforts to reform its asylum and migration policies. As was mentioned by the Minister, Greece developed an Action Plan on Migration Management and Asylum Reform, and progress has been achieved in a number of areas there. Two new services have been established – one for the examination of applications and one for initial reception. These are important steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) deployed asylum support teams in Greece. These teams provide advice on reception conditions in the Evros area, which is the one that is the most problematic. These activities will continue this year and will be further intensified. We have also conducted technical missions in Greece, including the Task Force for Greece, where the UNHCR, the IOM, Frontex and the EASO are all involved, in order to ensure a holistic approach. We continue to make great efforts to promote stronger engagement by the Turkish authorities in preventing the irregular migratory flows from transiting through Turkish territory towards the EU’s borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there has been progress, but much more needs to be done. The humanitarian situation in Evros is not acceptable. The conditions in which migrant and asylum seekers are kept are particularly worrying. Progress needs to be immediate and sustainable. More efforts are needed from the Greek authorities in this respect. Greece should trigger emergency mechanisms to provide immediate humanitarian relief to the migrants crossing the border area. They can use EU funding to do this and to renovate existing facilities and temporarily increase capacity by renting hostels for vulnerable groups, as well as deploying habitable containers within the security perimeters in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has on many occasions reminded the Greek authorities that failing to take urgent measures could lead to significant legal consequences, but of course, on a daily basis, there are also very serious humanitarian consequences. We are there to help, as are the Member States’ numerous organisations and institutions, but Greece itself has the responsibility to act in accordance with international and Union law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to provide strategic and targeted support for Greece’s efforts to reform its system. This involves the provision of additional financial assistance and emergency support but also expertise on the ground, in close collaboration with the national authorities, the agencies, the UNHCR and the IOM.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greece is among the main beneficiaries of the Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows Programme, with a total amount of EUR 309 million allocated so far. However, there is a problem of absorption from the Greek side, so very little of this money has been used so far. For immediate needs, we recently granted an additional amount of EUR 3.75 million under the European Refugee Fund to implement emergency measures, and we are concerned about the possibilities for using that money as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is crucial to streamline the delivery mechanism at national level, removing constraints and reinforcing management of the funds. Support will also be provided by the EU Task Force on Greece established by the Commission to assist and maximise the absorption of EU financial assistance and the implementation of the reform package. A dedicated expert was deployed to Athens in December 2011 to advise the Greek authorities directly involved in the implementation of these funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to recall the Commission’s recast proposal for the Dublin Regulation which, like the rest of the asylum package, aims to increase the efficiency of the system and to improve protection of the applicants. We are very grateful to Parliament for its strong support for the Commission’s proposal and to the Presidency for ensuring that they are now ready to enter into a trilogue on these issues and other related issues in the asylum package.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recent court rulings again prove that the EU needs a solid and efficient Common European Asylum System to support the Member States and guarantee a fair and effective system of providing international protection to people in need. This is a common goal for the European Union and has been so for quite some time. The need for common rules and greater solidarity is now even more pressing. We need high standards and stronger cooperation to make sure asylum seekers are treated equally wherever they apply and that people in need of protection can have access to this protection. With a fair system throughout the European Union it is possible for all Member States to share the responsibility for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of this effort, the Dublin system needs to be complemented with provisions addressing the root causes of crises and ensuring that deficiencies in one system or another in Member States are remedied without delay so that they do not affect the entire system and lead to human rights violations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is, and continues to be, involved. I appreciate the support from Parliament and the strong engagement by the Council and many other organisations, but of course the main responsibility lies with the Greek authorities.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, without doubt, prevention is better than cure. I absolutely agree with what the Commissioner said about the individual rights that should be enjoyed by asylum seekers. What he did not highlight and clarify to the House is the huge number of people who enter Greece as illegal immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="el">As you will understand, when Turkey liberalised visas for all countries in the area and in the Mediterranean, so that a person from Tripoli in Libya can enter Istanbul for EUR 50 and then travel by road to the Greek border, things changed. Those who enter at that point – brought there by various human traffickers – are people about whom we know nothing; we do not know their origin or what language they speak, they have no papers and, of course, they all apply for asylum. So when 300 or 500 people cross the border every day, it is extremely difficult to manage such a large number of people.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why I agree with Commissioner Malmström that we need distinctions in Dublin II and I particularly welcome that you too have realised this and want to strengthen it. As you will understand, with Greece bearing 90% of the burden of illegal immigration, things are becoming difficult.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the moment, the decision has been taken to have a large number of centres in which immigrants will be kept under humane conditions and efforts will be made to return them. However, there is only one solution to the problem, Commissioner: Turkey must be forced to apply its refoulement agreement with the European Union and must be forced to apply the agreement it signed with Greece in 1999. I do not think that we can have candidate countries opting to recognise or not to recognise their agreements with Europe by their own yardsticks. Turkey must be forced to prevent this massive pressure. For the rest, no one in Greece wants to deprive these people of their human rights. We participate fully in the Union and in the perceptions and values that we defend and we shall continue, Commissioner, to support and defend them, but we need real support from the Union, the Council, Parliament and from you, who are going about this in the right way.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the concerns raised by the asylum situation in Greece are not new, and important measures, both at national and European level, have already been taken in an attempt to address it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, however, this issue is all the more pertinent given that Greece has just adopted an amendment to the Presidential Decree of 2010 aiming to round up and arrest irregular migrants and asylum seekers, including people suspected of being carriers of infectious diseases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Needless to say, these measures are and will be extremely worrying in many regards. Firstly, they specifically target the most vulnerable people on the basis of discriminatory criteria. Secondly, they merely exacerbate prejudices against migrants and asylum seekers in Greece. Lastly, they are contrary to Greece’s obligations with regard to the detention of irregular migrants and persons who are entitled to international protection. I would therefore like to hear what you have to say, if that is indeed the case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Returning to a situation that has lasted for a very long time, I would like to address some other issues because we must contribute to pursuing a calm and objective debate and ensuring greater visibility of the action taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You touched upon the issue of funding. My first question relates therefore to the action that has been taken so far and the action that will be taken in the future. I would then like you to tell us how, for example, those persons who need international protection, who need access to asylum procedures, who need their applications and reception conditions examined are identified. As mentioned just now – perhaps in a different way – Greece is being compelled to fulfil the role of policeman of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must, of course, continue our efforts to help this Member State cope with migratory pressures that are difficult to manage, but the approach adopted must be that of international and European law, in a spirit of mutual trust between the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have spoken about challenge. While it is true that Greece is facing an enormous challenge, we need, above all, to respond to a challenge facing the European Union: its image in the world, and how the citizens see it. One would have thought that the end of the 20th century, culminating in the fall of the Berlin wall, would lead us to believe that we would never again see the construction of other walls anywhere in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet this is not at all the case. There is an enormous project, devised by Greece, to try to resolve to its huge problems caused by the arrival – as our Greek colleague said – of more than 300 people a day at its borders through a transit country, Turkey, and these are citizens who do not come from Turkey but from many other countries around the world. One would have thought that such a thing would never be seen again. What is more, this phenomenon is accompanied by an utterly disgraceful humanitarian situation, which violates the human rights we are constantly developing, protecting, defending and safeguarding as the most precious gift that the European Union has given to its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The solutions to the problems are, needless to say, difficult, and the messages are complex. Without getting into the technical side of things, it is of course quite clear that solidarity – as Cecilia Malmström has just explained, through the idea of shared responsibility, through technical mechanisms, the funding that must be used, the earmarking of EU funds – should make it possible to provide effective aid and to address the situation in which these people find themselves with dignity and in a manner that is consistent with human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second message, which has often been heard in recent weeks in Europe, is to up the stakes in the construction of texts and a rule of law system conveying the solidarity of the Member States towards Greece, which is coming under pressure along its borders. To ‘up the stakes’ means to construct a veritable arsenal of texts applicable by all and not to miss the point either, like when in my country, France, we talk about re-erecting internal borders when what we should be doing is protecting external borders – in a spirit of humanism, it should be remembered.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Madam President, the third reply, or the third message underlying our proposals, is to have the possibility and the political will to achieve a balance between the north and the south and to use development aid and partnerships with southern countries so that migrants have no desire to come to an El Dorado that does not exist.</p>

In Greece, according to the arrests made and Frontex statistics, over 120 000 third country nationals arrive in Greece every year.

      <p sl="fr">I had the opportunity to visit the island of Samos in Greece where I saw the very difficult situation at first hand, and I also visited the island of Lampedusa, where I saw just how complicated the problems were. It is by acting together in solidarity, supporting Greece, a Member of the European Union, as much as possible, that we will be able to respond.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, this is not the first time this issue has been raised. I believe that all the bodies – the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the Agency for Fundamental Rights, civil society organisations – have, at some time or other, sounded the alarm. What is more, this alarm has been heard by the Commission. Greece has since launched a national asylum and immigration plan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, however, there is no escaping the fact that the situation in the detention centres – and I have visited some in Greece – remains an insult to human dignity, that, since the start of the year, dozens of people have been killed at the Greek-Turkish border trying to cross the River Evros, and that NGOs are now seeing, within the context of the economic and social crisis in Greece, a sudden increase in racist attacks; they have recorded 63 cases in Athens and Patras, 18 of which involved police officers, during the last six months of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is clear that, in the period leading up to the elections in Greece, we hear preposterous proposals and a surfeit of extremely xenophobic policies – which can only be described as anti-immigrant – like the proposal to build detention centres, but, in particular, the proposal to herd together migrants and asylum seekers suspected of being ill. We also hear political leaders characterise the issue of migrants as a time bomb for society and for the security of the country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Confronted with this, of course, the European Union must respond with its values, its instruments and its principle of cooperation and solidarity. In this regard, it should nonetheless be said to the Member States that threatening Greece with expulsion from the Schengen area is an absolutely scandalous proposal, when, at the same time, the Member States openly regret that the Court prevents them from sending the asylum seekers back to Greece under the Dublin Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Frankly, this cowardice and this hypocrisy on the part of the Member States of the European Union cannot be tolerated, and the Commission has a great responsibility in this regard to guarantee our fundamental principles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as Turkey is concerned, I believe we should try to look at the situation as it is. With regard to the Community readmission agreement, Turkey is calling for equal treatment. Yet this is absolutely a case of double standards, since there is no prospect of dialogue on the liberalisation of visas with Turkey …</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the immigration situation in Greece reveals much about the general situation. Policies of economic and social inequality, repression, blatant discrimination, exploitation and terror are just some aspects of the picture. Immigrants are being detained en masse in terrible conditions, deprived of even the basic requirements, and occasionally fall victim to police violence and humiliating treatment. Of those who are not detained, most live in conditions of social exclusion, with no potential for social integration. They fall victim to violence and racism and to exploitation by gangs and employers.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the run-up to the elections, injustice and misconceptions are on the increase. The State is using immigrants as scapegoats for the crisis, making them the target of general despair and anger about plummeting living standards. They are being painted as a public health hazard and as common criminals. Xenophobic rhetoric is being stepped up and arrests and ‘clean-up’ operations are being carried out, as if we were talking about rubbish. In the last quarter of 2011 alone, 60 violent racist incidents were reported in Athens and they are spreading and have increased recently, with even minors taking part.</p>
      <p sl="el">The State bears serious responsibility, as does the European Union. We hope that the solidarity to which the minister referred earlier will stop being a mere slogan and will be put into practice, with an instrument that Europe can use to offer assistance to countries which, either due to their geography or for other reasons, are unable to cope with the waves of immigrants that the current global situation is forcing to seek a better future in Europe, a solidarity that should be global, that should use economic resources and supportive technical assistance to examine applications and create better screening centres. The European Union must decide on and prove which is its real face: is it fanatic and fearful or is it an area of equality and peaceful coexistence. The second path may be the more difficult, but it is what we want and what we must seek.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, to begin with I would like to thank the European Asylum Support Office which has now started to take highly efficient measures, to give serious help to Greece and to play a very effective role, in particular with regard to what many Members have just called for, in other words, providing reasonable asylum accommodation. A few days ago the Greek Parliament decided that additional accommodation which meets European standards should be built. The European Union will or should give support for this, with the help of the European Asylum Support Office.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe it is important that we in this Chamber do not constantly talk only about the dreadful things that have happened or the difficulties. Instead we should make it quite clear what we want to do and explain that we are not demanding that Greece comes up with a perfect solution overnight, given its disastrous internal situation. We will be applying realistic standards to the country and to what it is able to achieve. I also think it is sensible that many countries have stopped returning refugees and will continue to do so in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it seems to me to be important for us to extend our cooperation with Turkey. Ms Malmström has said that we are making an effort to do this. I think that amalgamating visa policy and return policy will cause significant problems. However, one possibility might be not to opt for the larger framework for visa policy, but instead to focus only on students and those in similar situations, including business people. This could be a solution for the countries which may currently still have difficulties in this area. Thirdly, we should agree on cooperation between police forces with regard to returning refugees, because this is about combating criminal people traffickers who are making money at the expense of poor refugees. It is not about disagreements with Turkey over questions of content. I hope and believe that Turkey is ready to start cooperating with our police forces on these issues.</p>

      <p sl="de">However, this is essentially also about helping the Greeks to register and identify these people more quickly, so that help can be provided sooner and so that those people who do not have qualifications or the entitlement to live in Greece or the European Union can be returned to their home countries, because they do have the opportunity of remaining there.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I should like to start by thanking the Commission and Commissioner Malmström in person for how she has stood by Greece over recent years. I do not want to beat about the bush. We face a problem that has taken on explosive proportions. Social peace in Greece is at risk, the public health issue has now been raised and, in addition, it is very difficult to explain to a nation that has seen its wages and pensions slashed that you need to spend money, money that is not to spare, helping ‘foreigners’.</p>
      <p sl="el">Yes, it is Greece’s problem and clearly things were not done in the past that should have been done and, believe me, Greeks are not proud of the images coming out of Evros; but it is a serious problem for the whole of the European Union and, fortunately, we are all agreed on that today. Allow me to say, even though I am immensely grateful for the help being given to my country, that the European Union is not doing enough to bring about the real, global European immigration policy that we need. We need to be bold and I call on the Commission and the Council to initiate at once the procedure to change Dublin II and create an effective system of solidarity between the Member States to manage refugees.</p>
      <p sl="el">We cannot avoid this, simply because the current situation serves the interests of certain Member States, at a disproportionate cost to certain other Member States, such as Greece. One thing is clear: however well Greece manages European funds, it is impossible to provide the high level of international protection that we have rightly established in the European Union, when 90% of immigrants arriving in Europe do so via Greece.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me to close with the following comment: As we all know, Greece is about to hold elections. Whether we like it or not, that is the fact of the matter. The issue of illegal immigration is already being exploited by politicians, mainly from extreme parties, there is populism to spare, unfortunately, and some people are finding it easy to play on people’s concerns and justified fears.

However, a humanitarian and organised immigration policy may benefit both nationals and immigrants, as the experience in Germany, Belgium, the US and Australia has proven. Would these countries be strong without immigrants? We need to ask the question. Many Greeks have helped to make these countries strong.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need therefore to put an end to the passive stand that has resulted in xenophobia and to isolate the extreme ministers, politicians and parties that are obstructing rather than solving the problem, with proposals for mass deportations, barriers at borders, detention barracks etc.; proposals that are both dangerous and unfounded. They blatantly infringe human rights, would require a massive operation on the part of the security corps and would involve huge deportation costs for 400 000 people, which is what some people are proposing.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are realistic and viable solutions that Greece should promote, with solidarity from Europe, because this really is a European problem. The country needs to assume its responsibilities. The legal immigration routes and effective use of existing funds, for which the Commissioner quoted the sum of EUR 309 million, the creation of reception and screening centres and the creation of preconditions to voluntary return will relieve the pressure on Greece and topple illegal immigration gangs.

      <p sl="mt">Thank you Madam President. I think that, as Mr Triantaphyllides stated, Greece is a country that is symptomatic of all of Europe with regard to the issue of immigration. We have to admit that Greece, like other countries in Southern Europe, is a transit country, not a destination country. This is an important point, and I will repeat it: Greece is a transit country and immigrants who arrive in Greece do not usually want to remain in Greece, but plan to cross over to other countries of the European Union, usually those in the North of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This means that the external borders of Greece, as well as the number of immigrants arriving in Greece are not Greece's problem, but the problem of all of the European Union. There are other countries that are in the same situation as Greece: Malta, my home country, is one of them, as is the island of Lampedusa – if anyone here thinks that the sixty thousand people who landed in Lampedusa last year wanted to remain in Lampedusa, it is definitely a mistaken impression.</p>
      <p sl="mt">We therefore have to find concrete ways of solving this collective European problem by giving it a collective European solution. I believe that the Council’s proposals regarding the revision of the Dublin Regulation are not enough, and that we are still far from reaching an agreement. I also believe that the Council’s conclusions regarding solidarity are also inadequate, although they are a step in the right direction. Until everyone understands that this truly is a European problem we definitely are not going to find a solution.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I should like to start by pointing out, in connection with what has already been said, that we Greeks are an hospitable race and we have proven over the years that we stand by our fellow men, wherever they are from, and respect their human rights. However, I must emphasise, in response to the comments and criticism made by my fellow members, that the family of the man who was murdered by illegal immigrants at six in the morning a few months ago, as he was taking his pregnant wife to the maternity clinic to give birth, also has rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">I read the letter sent yesterday by the French and German Ministers for the Interior asking for the facility to introduce emergency border controls and the heads of state have frequently referred in the past to reductions in the numbers of immigrants they wish to receive in their country.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me to emphasise the following in response to these comments: when you do not want people to break into your house, you do not lock the sitting room door or the kitchen door. You lock the front door, you secure the main entrance. That is the solution. On the question of illegal immigration in Europe, we must apply the simple logic that we apply in our own homes. In this case, Europe is our home and the main entrance is the external borders of Europe. If you ask Frontex or any other competent authority, they will tell you that the main gateway for illegal immigration into Europe is, as we have already heard, the Greek-Turkish border.</p>
      <p sl="el">Again as we have already heard, we need solidarity in Europe, we need funds, know-how and the human resources to strengthen and guard our borders more effectively. At the same time, however, we urgently need to demand that Turkey put a stop at long last to its insulting tolerance of gangs and traffickers taking advantage of the fact that no visa is required in order to enter Turkey from numerous neighbouring countries and, of course, take back the illegal immigrants who arrive in Europe via its territory.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is high time that the refoulement agreement was completed and, as regards people seeking international protection, we need – as we have already heard – a fairer distribution of responsibilities for examining their applications; I am referring, obviously, to changes to Dublin II. If you tell me that other Member States have similar problems, I will tell you that you are mistaken. Around 400 illegal immigrants a day do not enter your countries; and that is based solely on Frontex data, solely on the number of arrests. In reality, the number is even higher. In your countries, you do not have a far right party standing on the hustings every day, because we are in the midst of an electoral campaign, proposing that mines – I repeat mines – should be placed along our land borders with Turkey and I wonder if you often hear proposals in your country that everyone should be entitled to carry a gun. Europe delayed drastically in taking decisions and measures on the debt crisis in Greece. Let it not repeat its error on illegal immigration.</p>

There is also talk of clean-up operations of streets and city centres. Racist and xenophobic tendencies are on the rise.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Greece does not currently undertake legal responsibility for reception services and is therefore forcing third-country citizens to live in poverty only to then detain them for that very reason. Fortunately, the EU is helping to improve the situation. However, are these the sort of measures that the Commission had in mind? Is EU money being used to detain people?

All neighbouring countries must cooperate to control the migration flows and make the borders secure. Frontex has a vital role to play in this process.

However, Greece is in crisis and is unable to manage such large immigration flows on its own, because, as numerous speakers have pointed out, nearly 90% of immigrants wanting to get into the European Union arrive in Greece and Dublin II traps them there. Of course, the problems relating to the screening and detention of illegal immigrants are huge and, of course, the procedure for examining asylum applications is not as short as it should be, despite the improvements made.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, it is hypocritical to compare Greece with other EU Member States in terms of arrivals and the asylum procedure, because the problem is incomparable. The only way to resolve the immigration issue in Greece is to address the real problem, which is a European issue that needs a European solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, indeed the problem in Greece is a European issue too, which has to be solved at European level, for instance by reforming Dublin II and also by investing money in a Greek asylum system. Then again, the money can only be spent at the Greek level, and there we see a lot of shortcomings which are also manifested in the implementation report on the Greek National Action Plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can see that only 11 people have been recruited for the new asylum service out of 700 planned vacancies. In addition, it is only open on Saturday mornings. That does not really help a lot. And the conditions in detention centres have only improved because there are now fewer people. But why should people who are looking for asylum be detained in any case?</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall there are still lots of problems, and indeed it does not help if now in the election campaign migrants are being used as bait in elections and unhelpful remarks are being made. We should really try to help migrants together, to give them a decent chance for a life here in the European Union, and not leave it up to the Greeks alone. Everybody has to do their share in this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, there are some points in today’s debate which I do not understand. On the one hand, the Commission wants to put the EU under the supervision of the European Court of Human Rights, a court which has annulled the Dublin II regulation and which therefore prevents asylum seekers from being returned to the country of first asylum. On the other hand, I am constantly hearing people say that the Dublin II regulation is an important means of resolving this problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the problem is concerned, we are repeatedly given the same status reports: the green border is wide open, Turkey is being negligent and there is a lack of willingness to cooperate, with the exception of occasional proposals for financial packages. I would like to know why we do not honestly admit that a fence may not be the best solution, but it is an initial means of solving this problem, Ms Malmström. We must not forget that the people in these regions of Greece have a right to be heard and a right to protection.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes a year after another, essentially identical debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">One year ago Lampedusa was overrun, as was the case in Greece this year and in previous years. Mr Busuttil made the point not long ago: 60 000 people came to Lampedusa, but certainly had no intention of staying there. These migrants – economic migrants – arrive in Italy, Greece and Malta, not by any means to stay there but rather to move on to other EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The answer to this is more Europe, more responsibility, more solidarity and enterprise. Negotiations have been opened on the funds for this area of action over the 2014-2020 planning period and might I suggest that Ms Malmström steps in there, just as the Council is pushing for a more enterprising approach.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no doubt that there are some obstreperous Member States. What we need to do is overcome this attitude, otherwise Europe will not make any progress in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you for the debate. This is extremely important and I have no doubt we will come back to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greece needs to do a few urgent things. It needs to continue to work on the action plan to establish proper reception conditions where people can be screened, registered and have their cases tried as quickly as possible. There needs to be humanitarian assistance to those people who are now in the Evros region and who are in a very difficult situation, especially children and other vulnerable groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">There needs to be better protection of the border and a system where people can be returned after a proper procedure if they have been found not to be in need of international protection, and they need to reform the administrative systems so that all the money available is put to proper use. There are huge amounts of money available – hundreds of millions of euros – but they need to be used by the Greek authorities. I am convinced that a lot of things can be done in order to speed up the procedures and the bureaucracy here.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all these issues there has been progress, but there needs to be more, and in all these issues we will continue to assist Greece. We are assisting with money, as I said. The EASO is there, willing to help and work hand in hand with the Greek authorities and also on further implementation of the action plan. Some of you mentioned the staffing, which is also really acute.</p>
      <p sl="en">Frontex is there, Europol is there to help fight the trafficking some of you mentioned. Experts from Member States and from the Commission are available and imported organisations are there to help: the IOM, UNHCR, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also trying to support Greece in its efforts to negotiate with Turkey so that Turkey can take more responsibility. We are trying to assist Turkey on administrative reforms and with money so that they can take some responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">So progress is being made. We are willing to assist. Nobody denies the enormous difficulties that Greece is facing today. The economic situation is very difficult. Lots of people in Greece are suffering today, we are aware of that. We also know that Greece, because of its geographical situation – and nothing can change this – is very much open to migratory flows that will then seek to come further into Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">So it is a European problem, and we in the Commission and the Council will continue to help and will work hand in hand. Nobody expects changes to come over a weekend. It will take time, but there needs to be steady progress, and this can only happen in partnership. But the main responsibility to make sure that everything is in place is in the hands of the Greek authorities. That has to be clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">So thank you very much for this debate. Thank you for your support and understanding on this, and I am sure we will come back to this issue very soon.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, there is no doubt that the discussion here this evening has also demonstrated that this is a very important subject for all of us. It is incredibly important for us to discuss the situation in Greece with regard to migration so that we can maintain focus on the challenges that Greece is facing in this area.</p>
      <p sl="da">As Commissioner Malmström has just quite rightly said, Greece has a great deal of work ahead of it, and it is important to always consider how we can show genuine and practical solidarity with Greece and other Member States that experience considerable migration pressure. That is, of course, why we need to assist each other in the EU and ensure that there is a national preparedness system, so that every Member State is immediately able to handle unexpected migration pressure, and it goes without saying that this should, of course, be done with full respect for any obligations under EU and international law. In addition, there is a need to work to prevent crises in a Member State’s asylum system – that is self-evident – and to provide support and a helping hand when a crisis does occur.</p>
      <p sl="da">That is what we are doing and will continue to do in Greece, and on the strength of this support, we can help to ensure that, as soon as possible, Greece will have an asylum system in which the asylum processing is both fair and efficient and the reception facilities function well. This will help us to ensure normalisation of the Dublin cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="da">Lastly, I would like to thank you for an excellent debate. It has been interesting to hear your views. This is a subject that deserves thorough debate, because, as I said, it is an enormous challenge for Greece and, in truth, it is also an enormous challenge for our European cooperation.</p>

    <intervention id="4-605-000" speaker_id="96979" name="Francesca Balzani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motion under debate today sees the full implementation of the agreement that the budgetary authorities concluded in December on the 2012 portion of financing for the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) research project.</p>
      <p sl="it">The ITER project, which involves the European Union as well as major countries such as Japan, the United States and China, requires a further EUR 650 million in appropriations and therefore the expenditure ceiling set out in Heading 1a of the financial perspectives needs to be revised by the same amount. Through this motion we therefore give the green light to this EUR 650 million increase in commitment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreement on which this important aspect of the 2012 budget is based has been a crucial aspect of these budget negotiations. In fact I would say that it has been a fundamental condition for the 2012 budget conciliation to reach a positive outcome and for the negotiations to conclude. It has allowed us to substantially increase the funds in 2012 for important programmes such as Lifelong Learning, Competitiveness and Innovation, the Seventh Research Programme, and especially for allowing us to fund ITER using transfers as little as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">That was very important, representing a positive outcome that allowed this House to approve the agreement. ITER is therefore added to the 2012 budget without any negative impact on the implementation of other programmes and without becoming a burden on other programmes; that is a very significant fact.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, this agreement and this motion marks the real beginning of the sensitive matter of implementing the 2012 budget. Even through we focus all our attention on the negotiations for concluding the draft budget, there is then the important step of putting it into action, which starts with this step and will see us take particular care over the sensitive matter of payments.</p>
      <p sl="it">My hope is that, during the implementation of the 2012 budget, we will be able to re-locate the hitherto excellent spirit of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in particular, which was crucial for finalising the budget and will be even more important for supporting its implementation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I welcome your report setting out the position of Parliament on what was agreed, as the report reflects the political agreement that we reached on 1 December 2011 to provide additional ITER financing of exactly EUR 1.3 billion for 2012 and 2013. In addition to the EUR 100 million already included in the 2012 budget, it is necessary to raise the ceiling of Heading 1a and to reduce proportionately this year’s ceiling for Heading 5. Here, the agreement does not prejudge implementation or what should be done for 2013, because the other challenge we have to face in the negotiations over next year’s budget is how to find an additional EUR 360 million without damaging any other projects in the areas of competitiveness and an innovative Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Ms Balzani pointed out, draft amending budget No 1/2012 reflects the agreement reached between the three institutions at the end of the 2012 budget procedure to cover the additional EUR 1.3 billion of costs for the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project in 2012-2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, the draft amending budget increases the ceiling for Heading 1a in 2012 by EUR 650 million. As a group, we support Ms Balzani’s report and therefore appeal for it to be voted through, precisely in order to honour the agreement between the two budget authorities as mediated by the Commission late last year.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the ITER project will be one of the most important issues that we will have to discuss during the negotiations leading to the approval of the draft budget for 2013. These negotiations are about to get under way, given the forthcoming publication of the draft budget that Mr Lewandowski will present to us on 25 April.</p>
      <p sl="it">As set out in the guidelines for the 2013 budget adopted by this House, we are expecting that the agreed EUR 360 million to fund the additional costs of the ITER project under the 2013 budget will be guaranteed without undermining the correct and efficient implementation of European policies, especially those that contribute to achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which have been our strategic priorities since the start of the year and are moreover supported by the Council.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament I would like to welcome Ms Balzani’s report, and I am very pleased that in this case both the Commission and the major groups in the European Parliament are seeing eye to eye, and that we will reinforce our decision made in December 2011 and request the reallocation of funds.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are very often faced with criticism that the increased costs of the project are a reason to call it into question, but we must add that one of the very reasons of increased costs is the budgetary authorities’ questioning, and this results in delays. We must be aware that any further hesitation will also result in increased costs, and this is important not only for the current budgetary years of 2012 and 2013, but also in respect of the 2014-2020 budgetary period.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is therefore crucial for European Member States to provide reinforced political support for this project, because it is extremely important for us to be aware that the enormous social groups that are emerging as a result of global trends, energy demand, demographic changes and globalisation and are entering the market as energy consumers are more prevalent in this present age than ever before. Because I have time, I would like to tell you that it is very important for those of us from the new Member States, and perhaps for the entire European Union, to remember the date when the ITER project was launched.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In 1985, as the first step to ending the Cold War, Russian General Secretary Gorbachev met with Ronald Reagan, and they agreed not only on the commencement of nuclear disarmament but also on scientific and technological cooperation. The beginning of the ITER project was made possible by the scientific and technological cooperation initiated in 1985. This project is supported by the political parties of the European Union, which means that the decision here must not just be a technological one, but must also be a political confirmation of the fact that we have completely put the Cold War behind us, and that this is a good thing. Finally, as a Hungarian I would like to welcome fusion energy, conceived by Hungarian scientist and Nobel laureate Edward Teller.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that it is rare to find a project, conceived by us as Hungarians and as Europeans in a global environment, that we can support over such a long period of time. I therefore say that we need to continue this project not only from a financial or an energy production standpoint, but also for political reasons. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and to say at this point that I am very happy, both as standing rapporteur for research in the committee and also on behalf of our group, that we were finally able to reach a result which enabled us to finance ITER for a while longer.</p>
      <p sl="de">The whole process regarding the financing of ITER has been quite difficult for us. First of all it proved that the Council was not living up to all its obligations and even less to its political promises of actually putting emphasis on research. At the same time we saw a development whereby the Council wanted to actually cut money from Heading 1a, a heading where the current Framework Programme for Research is more or less 100% implemented. More than anything it is supporting the 2020 Strategy, etc.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you know, there was a suggestion that money for ITER should be taken from this part of the budget. We refused to let this happen and were persistent and very united as a Parliament. The Committee on Budgets was also very firm on this. In the light of all this the outcome is fairly good, but at the same time I want to underline that this is not – at least from our group’s point of view – an ideal outcome. However, taking into account the discussion I do not think we could have achieved anything better.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is easy to agree with previous speakers regarding the future. ITER is an important project and has huge potential. At the same time I think the past year has shown that we need to have a better view on how ITER is governed, because we should not end up in situations where a big project that affects taxpayers’ money and also affects other research funds, as we have seen with this solution, is so badly managed that we have to use solutions like this to save the project. This has not been handled well.</p>
      <p sl="de">It also proves that in the next MFF we need a more solid and more ring-fenced solution for financing ITER so that we will not be here in five years or in three years doing the same thing we are doing tonight: having a report to transfer funds for the ITER project.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another worrying factor that I might mention in this context is the fact that the Council was sleeping on this. We were able to reach a final agreement, and after that apparently some of the delegations in the Council still wanted to go back on the agreement. This is not a healthy development. I am happy that they understood that this was not a desirable outcome. In the end, the Council will apparently stick to this agreement, as will we.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope we can learn from this, particularly because Horizon 2020, which will be the eighth Framework Programme, needs all the money it can get. This will bring growth to Europe. Therefore in the future we should not have solutions which, practically speaking, mean that we have less money for certain research projects because others are badly governed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the rapporteur and other colleagues for their good cooperation. Considering the circumstances, the outcome on this matter is very good.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you said that the situation was not ideal. That is putting it mildly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe has been in a grave situation of crisis, budgetary problems and scarce resources for several years and, I fear, will continue to be for a few years more. Each of our Member States is trying, after a fashion, to prepare its budget. We are trying to demonstrate the added value of the European Union and of European resources, and we are struggling to do this. We are taking this decision at a time when even the most ardent of us are calling for the European budget to be reduced. I find this extraordinary!</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context of exceptional crisis, we are being called upon, this evening and tomorrow during the vote, to endorse this amending budget of EUR 650 million in commitment appropriations, in addition to the EUR 479 million already allocated for the ITER project in the 2012 budget. We will therefore end up with a credited budget line of EUR 1.12 billion. EUR 1.12 billion! That is 1% of the EU budget. Just imagine. We are broke, we are at a standstill, we are in difficulty, and we are committing EUR 1.12 billion to a project whose most optimistic advocates tell us that, possibly, in 2050, or indeed in 2080, it may pay off.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must be mad. Have we gone barking mad? At a time when everything is going badly, when the ship is sinking, we are committing astronomical sums of money to a project for which we see absolutely no prospect of success – certainly over the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, we may not be taking money away from some budgets. Although … We have discussed the framework programme, Europe 2020, research, and so on, but whatever we put under this item, we cannot put elsewhere. We are not in fact putting it in renewable energy, which has an immediate impact. If we invest it immediately in renewable energy, the impact is immediate: not in 2050, not in 2080, but in 2013, in 2014, providing thousands of jobs. I do not therefore understand how we can continue to engage in such lunacy when we are in such difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Herzog, you reminded us of the background to this project. You told us that it was born in the aftermath of the cold war. That is true. Wait. Thirty years have passed since then, thirty years! Has the world not changed a bit? Should we not reassess our budgets? Must we continue, today, in the situation in which we find ourselves, in which Europeans are becoming impoverished, in which they no longer believe in the European project, in which Member States are struggling to balance their books and we are struggling to prepare our budget, to allocate EUR 1.12 billion to this project, not only in 2012 but also in the following years, in 2013, in 2014, until 2020, as you said? Are we going to continue on this course?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I truly think that we have become totally obsessed by this project, to which we cling in a way that is almost pathological, when all the indicators are already set to red. You will therefore understand that neither I nor my group will be able to vote for this amending budget.</p>

      <p sl="fr">blue-card answer. – Mr President, that is, indeed, the problem, that is to say that we have become rooted in a technology of the past. Nuclear energy belongs in the past, and we must gently leave the past behind. The illusion of nuclear fusion is something some people want to believe in, in a quasi-ideological – or indeed religious – way, although we have no proof that, by 2050, or indeed 2080, it will provide any kind of answer to our energy problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not understand, therefore, why we still cling to it. We had these discussions when we visited Cadarache.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I assure the Commissioner that we in the United Kingdom believe that it is important for Europe to remain at the forefront of research into the next generation of energy provision. For that reason we strongly support the ITER project. Accordingly we are happy to support this deal which was reached with the Council. We understand that it will provide an extra EUR 350 million, and that is of course part of this amending budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to declare an interest here, because the Culham research laboratory near Oxford is within my constituency. However, I would point out that, in assuring the future of this facility, we will be assuring the future of over 500 jobs for research workers. These are people who are delivering world-leading technology, and this is a technical expertise which frankly we cannot afford to lose.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I have to say a word of caution, Commissioner. As always with such leading-edge technology, it is bedevilled with cost overruns and delayed delivery. With that in mind there are three points that I want to make.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first is that additional funding must be found from within the existing budgets, and I note that through this deal we shall not be calling on Member States to provide any additional funding in 2012. This is exactly right, because governments and budgets are under severe restraint. That too must be the case in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, this is taxpayers’ money, so it is important that we instil a culture of financial discipline in the research community – but it is also important that within this House we impose responsible scrutiny on that industry. However, to do that, we have to be kept informed, and I urge you, Commissioner, to supply us with the information on which we must make those judgements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, to facilitate the above, I think it is absolutely vital that ITER comes within the next Multiannual Financial Framework, not outside it. As Carl Haglund said earlier, we will need to see it ring-fenced, budgeted and accountable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am not against fusion energy. However, when it comes to ITER, the European Commission should have learned from its mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately this never happens. For example, the Galileo project was estimated to cost EUR 7 billion in the year 2000; by 2010 the estimated costs had tripled to EUR 22 billion. The cost continues to climb even further with no real end in sight. The parallels are alarming. ITER’s partners are saying they can only build a stripped-down version of the device by 2018, five years later than the date set in the original agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first experiments intended to validate fusion for power will not take place until the end of 2025. Construction costs are likely to double from the original 2006 estimate of EUR 5 billion to EUR 10 billion. The cost of ITER’s operational phase – another EUR 5 billion over 20 years – may also rise. As 90% of the project is directly managed by the participating states, we are unlikely ever to know what the final costs will be. Taxpayers deserve to know the cost of ITER as they are ultimately paying for it, yet this House continues to approve the financing of a project that has already cost over 50% more than the original estimates.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s approach to public finance is catastrophic. On Monday Commissioner Lewandowski told us that the 2011 payments budget was in surplus to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion, yet a couple of months ago he told us it was short to the amount of EUR 11 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Which version is true? Does he not know how much money he has in the bank at the end of each day? I know this and everybody knows this. ITER, like Galileo and the EU budget, is becoming an absurdity, but the taxpayers who are left to foot the bill for these projects are not laughing at all, I can assure you. We should scrap this project altogether.</p>

We do not have many such possibilities. I also firmly believe that Europe should be in the forefront of research and development.

We must, however, get over the constant foot-dragging surrounding the funding problems of key EU plans. Everything comes at a price. The crisis is no argument. On the contrary, we must support projects such as ITER in order to overcome the crisis and for the sake of our future prospects, not least because the programme is also an opportunity for smaller EU states. We also need to give a boost to the small and medium-sized enterprises that are producing half of all the components for the fusion programme.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It would short-sighted not to try, even indirectly, to exploit the sun and water for the good of mankind, even if the fundamental results of the ITER projects are perhaps beyond some of us.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner and ladies and gentleman who have stayed until this late hour to discuss this amending budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, it is a miracle that the Commission has been able, alongside Parliament, whose rapporteurs I heartily congratulate, to find these EUR 1.3 billion and, moreover, that these EUR 1.3 billion do not come 50% from revision and 50% from redistribution of heading 1a but rather have benefited from a greater percentage of revision than corresponds to the redeployment, which means that they have been able to twist the Council’s arm requesting new money, fresh funds, for new financial needs, for new financial commitments. That is what Parliament has always called for because if we did not do it this way we would be pursuing a bad budgetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that we are going to struggle to find EUR 360 million in commitment appropriations next year without damaging projects that are already underway in the heading and we are also going to struggle with payment appropriations but, in any event, I think that we are adopting a very positive spirit in our approach to the 2013 budget in this area.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not understand the criticisms from some political groups which are using the crisis as a justification, as my colleague from the left was saying a moment ago. On the contrary, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project is a flagship EU project that is going to give us energy independence. MEPs are being asked to find it in themselves to look beyond the next five or 10 years, we need to look beyond budgetary requirements.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think it is a very big mistake and I hope, in any event, that the ITER project continues in good health and that in 20, 30, 40 years’ time we have sustainable and clean energy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">blue-card question. – Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, thank you for accepting my question. I do not understand why you are presenting this project as a flagship project, when neither you, nor I, nor anyone else knows for certain that it will in fact solve our energy problems, or why you claim that the crisis is an alibi. Look at the difficulty that we are having today preparing our budget and that the Member States are having preparing theirs. Look at our inability to finance the 2020 programme and all the undertakings we have entered into. I do not understand, therefore, how anyone can say that the crisis is an alibi, and I refute that claim.</p>

      <p sl="es">blue-card answer. – Mr President, Ms Durant, I find it very surprising that a representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance should tell me that we need to keep our feet on the ground and look at the realities of the situation precisely because part of the Greens’ political project involves seeking out new forms of energy, new and alternative ways of producing energy.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an alternative way, which will appeal to you more or less but, in any event, it may represent a solution for European energy independence. Simply for the support and technological development that this project can produce, it seems to me that EUR 1.3 billion now is a very cheap investment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, nuclear fusion offers the prospect of an almost limitless source of clean energy. I think that by using the knowledge base supplied by the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy, the ITER nuclear fusion experimental reactor, which is being built at Cadarache in France, can pave the way for the future generation of fusion reactors, enabling Europe to become a global leader in the construction of experimental fusion reactors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is important for the necessary financial resources to be provided. In fact, the agreement signed between the European Parliament and Council in December 2011 envisages support being provided for the ITER project’s additional costs in the 2012-2013 period. They amount to EUR 1.3 billion, EUR 100 million of which are already included in the 2012 budget. EUR 360 million are commitment appropriations for 2013, and the ceilings for the credit appropriations under Heading 1a will be increased by EUR 840 million, with EUR 650 million being allocated in 2012 and EUR 190 million in 2013. I support the draft amending budget No 1/2012, which is part of the 2012 budget under Article 08 20 02 Euratom – European Joint Undertaking for ITER – Fusion for Energy, amounting to EUR 650 million in commitment appropriations, since this budgetary adjustment is fully in line with the agreement signed in December 2011.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ITER is, first and foremost, a massive effort of public research within the framework of cooperation and ground-breaking, forward-looking international transdisciplinary pooling. Thermonuclear fusion promises humankind electricity that is abundant, infinitely renewable, clean, accessible to all and cheap. No other form of energy production can make this promise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The success of ITER is especially important for the future of humankind, given that electricity needs are expected to increase. For ITER to succeed, however, we must turn our backs on the predatory and destructive rationale of competition and financialisation of the energy sector. There must be an end to privatisation. Large, integrated, publicly owned 21st century companies of the need to be created that are able to meet the scientific, technological and economic challenges represented by ITER and its industrialisation. There needs to be environmental planning. As regards energy, it is impossible to dissociate research, design, production, transport networks and distribution if we do not want to encourage waste, social inequalities in terms of access to energy and risks of major accidents.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, ITER is a long-term research project. This means that we cannot simply shelve the treaties that we have entered into and the future plans that we have made in the important area of energy research every time we encounter a crisis or financial difficulties. We cannot decide not to comply with these treaties any longer and to turn a technology of the future into a technology of the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was somewhat suspicious about the claim that this technology should be a thing of the past. I was suspicious because we did not make smooth progress during the 30 years of research simply as a result of the fact that 30 years ago we did not have the computer capacity that we have today, which we needed both for materials research and for managing the high temperatures. This is why we have only been able to forge ahead rapidly with the ITER research in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we launch large projects, we must ensure that they are on a sound financial footing right from the start. This is a lesson which we need to learn within the European Union with regard to a variety of projects. When we start projects, they must have a professional project management team from the very beginning, an accurate and realistic estimate of costs, not simply one which sounds good in political terms, detailed financial controlling, a professional tendering process and a project support and monitoring function which can guarantee us an overview of the actual costs in the short and medium term. This is a long-term research project. It will not be completed in a short period and this is why I believe it is necessary for us not only to continue with this project, but also to acknowledge its future prospects. I have been to Cadarache myself and I have a different impression from yours, Ms Durant.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that this amending budget concerning the financing of ITER was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Budgets on 29 March. By financing this cost overrun, we avoid scrapping a fundamental strategic research project in which the European Union has a leading role, and we honour our international commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us remember that none of the seven partners of the EURATOM community has questioned its overall contribution to the project. Japan, despite the drama of Fukushima, decided to honour its budgetary commitments in ITER to the full. Without this agreement, hundreds of researchers would have had to suspend their work and the ITER project would have suffered detrimental delays. Today, 1 000 people work for ITER in Cadarache. In the period from 2015 to 2017-2018, the building construction and machine assembly phase saw between 4 000 and 5 000 people deployed on this site.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I welcome the agreement concluded between the three European institutions concerning the financing of the additional costs for the ITER project. It is important that this was achieved through savings made in other budget lines without raising for discussion Parliament’s priorities for the EU budget. I regard the agreement that has been reached as beneficial at a time when ITER is one of the most ambitious research projects in the world. At the same time, its results could pave the way for a safe, affordable energy source that does not produce carbon dioxide emissions. In light of this, I support the long-term financing of this international project. I think that the EU should ensure the project’s success at an acceptable cost and with reasonable financial and technical risks. This will enable it to fulfil its international commitment to this project.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would just like to make two points. ITER is an intercontinental project. Therefore, contributing what it agreed to deliver is a matter affecting the credibility of the European Union. However, as indicated in the discussion, the project has experienced cost overruns. There is also the real problem of management being delegated to the Fusion for Energy joint undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is some good news. ITER has to be audited by the Court of Auditors and falls within the scope of a discharge procedure. We can, therefore, draw conclusions in order to avoid such problems of budget overruns in future intercontinental projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point should be obvious to Ms Andreasen. The 2011 budget faced a problem in that more than EUR 10 billion allocated to legitimate projects could not be disbursed, for two reasons: the shortage of money and the inflexibility of the Financial Regulation. This has caused the current problem we have in 2012, namely how to make up this shortfall for 2011 out of revenue from the 2012 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">You need some insight into how the EU budget works in order to understand the paradox of a small surplus and some underspending The real problem concerned more than EUR 10 billion that should have been paid out in 2011 and could not be disbursed.</p>

      <p sl="en">At the end of 2011, the procedure for drawing up the 2012 budget was marked by deep rifts between Parliament and the Council concerning the financing of ITER, the thermonuclear fusion research project based at Cadarache in the Bouches-du-Rhône. EUR 750 million of cost overruns compared with the initial estimates had to be found for 2012 and only EUR 100 million had been agreed by the end of 2011. A compromise therefore had to be found for the remaining EUR 650 million. After long negotiations with the Council, Parliament succeeded in getting this money released by increasing the financial ceiling of the budget heading concerned, while the Council initially envisaged financing solely through the redeployment of funds from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development. The additional financing needed for the ITER project in 2012 will therefore be available without the other research programmes being compromised. Along with all the Members of the European Parliament, I will nonetheless remain vigilant as to the sources of financing that will be mobilised in 2013 to cover the overrun that has already been announced. It is our duty to ensure that the ITER project will not be financed to the detriment of other priority policies of the EU 2020 strategy.</p>

After long and arduous negotiations with the Council and the Commission, we have arrived at an agreement on additional financing for the project for 2012 and 2013, which Parliament approved last December. This is an important agreement, because the European Union is in danger of losing face to its international partners involved in the project. The Member States need to realise that, when they make promises, they need to keep them, especially when the time comes to make payment. I should also like to point out that, both for the 2012 budget and for the 2013 budget, the additional financing requirements for ITER should not jeopardise other research programmes. The European Parliament will be watching to ensure that financing for ITER will not be at the expense of other policies and programmes which are crucial to the EU 2020 strategy objectives.</p>

    <intervention id="4-631-000" speaker_id="28323" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report submitted by Filip Kaczmarek on behalf of the Committee on Development on the impact on aid delivery of devolution of the Commission’s management of external assistance from its headquarters to its delegations (2011/2192(INI) (A7-0056/2012)</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-632-000" speaker_id="28280" name="Filip Kaczmarek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I present to you concerns the impact of the devolution of the management of external assistance. This process has been ongoing for several years and involves the relocation of management from Brussels to EU delegations in countries benefiting from our development aid. The ultimate objective of the devolution of external assistance managed by the European Commission, is to enhance the speed and effectiveness of development actions and to improve the thoroughness of financial management procedures. This is one of the reasons why the Committee on Budgetary Control submitted its opinion on this report. A further objective is to increase the quality of aid in partner countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am certain you will agree that a decentralised approach to the issue of development cooperation has many positive aspects. Inter alia , it brings decision-making closer to delivery realities and closer to direct beneficiaries. It is more effective in operational terms as well as in terms of the coordination and harmonisation of the work of different donors. This approach also ensures local ownership. We should add that the devolution of management will not resolve all problems. In the report, I have tried to indicate additional goals, the achievement of which is essential to increasing the effectiveness of the aid provided.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The aid managed by individual delegations continues to cover a very wide range of areas that are unduly broad in scope. This is why it is so important to enhance coordination between the EU, Member States and partner countries as well as to improve the coordination of development activities and increase their efficiency and effectiveness. A good way of increasing effectiveness is through a more appropriate division of labour, focusing on the areas where the Union has a competitive advantage and a genuine ability to provide added value.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Devolution also lowers the transaction costs of delivering aid. This is good thing, but it is not the only way to reduce these costs. One such cost-reducing measure is budget support, since it places the focus more firmly on the quality of the aid, on partnerships and on the recipient countries’ needs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, I believe that attention should be drawn to a number of issues which are vital for increasing the effectiveness of the aid provided. In recent years, the composition of delegation staffing has shifted towards more political and trade-oriented functions. In the report, therefore, we call for an appropriate staffing balance to be struck between aid management and other functions undertaken by delegations. The high rate of staff turnover within the delegations is also cause for concern, as it weakens the functional continuity of the institution, the so-called institutional memory, and has a negative effect on the efficiency of operations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the report, we once again call for the appointment of Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) focal points in each delegation, the obvious objective of which is to monitor the impact of EU policy at partner-country level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am convinced that the Union’s financial instruments and also the European Development Fund (EDF) need to be more focused on combating poverty. The eradication of poverty in the long term is, after all, the main objective of the European development cooperation, as stated in Article 208 of the Treaty of Lisbon. In the draft report, we also emphasise that neither the European Commission nor the Member States should use the current financial crisis to justify a ‘doing more with less’ approach, as such an approach involves, inter alia , a reduction in staffing levels in bilateral aid agencies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to ask you to support the report and I thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the report presented just now endorses the institutional changes adopted through the Treaty of Lisbon. This means that the reorganisation of the Commission and creation of the European diplomatic service form the basis for the devolution of part of development policy. Delegations will manage external assistance in a way that is better adapted to actual needs because of having direct contact with the local population. At the same time, delegation staff must receive suitable training in the management of funds as this is a new kind of activity which the delegations need to perform. Devolution must also be accompanied by a review of the activities of the other agencies in the area. This will help identify clearly the financing priorities as well as the situations involving double financing. I should emphasise the role played by the local authorities in understanding the environment in which EU delegations operate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the effectiveness of development aid is of the utmost importance and, as the rapporteur mentions, there are questions that go much further than issues relating to the management, decentralised or not, of Commission delegations. One is the issue of the need for consistency between the European Union’s sectoral policies and stated development aid objectives. Another is ownership of aid, which is so necessary and requires the country, and its authorities, institutions and social organisations to be significantly involved in coming up with policies and implementing them. In this regard, the European Union should genuinely support and not dictate; should capacitate and not impose; should respect the peculiarities, choices and sovereign will of developing countries; and should not lose sight of the importance of cooperation among developing countries, which should be encouraged.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Development aid should promote full development and encourage developing countries to make full use of their domestic potential and not perpetuate their dependence, which means that a substantial part of aid now returns to its countries of origin in the form, inter alia , of the acquisition of goods and services.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we welcome Mr Kaczmarek’s report and the report of the Court of Auditors, both of which show that the exercise of devolution of external assistance is bringing positive results. I believe that, thanks to devolution, EU aid is now being delivered better, closer and faster to the beneficiaries. Of course, in order to fully exploit the potential of devolution we need to ensure staffing levels for the future. This is an area in which cooperation with Parliament is very much needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said that, we are committed to improving what both the Court of Auditors report and Mr Kaczmarek’s report identified as the real issues. We should do more to measure the results of our aid in order to move towards a more result-oriented culture. Given the restraints of human resources, we need to concentrate these where there is an identified need, and we have identified additional needs in Africa and in neighbourhood delegations.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has been mentioned, the question of turnover is a real issue, given that 40% of our employees are contract agents with three-year contracts. Increasing this ratio could create a real problem in the future. Therefore, in order to mitigate the problem of contract agents and the turnover of agents, we are working to move the contracts of contract agents from the headquarters to delegations once their contracts are over, and we would like to see six-year contracts rather than shorter ones in the future. We call on the rapporteur and Parliament to support our efforts to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new External Action Service is very important for the future. We have agreed on working arrangements in order to divide the work. In addition, the delegation heads will have great responsibility: not only will they act as authorising officers, they will also be responsible for the consistency of the service. However – and this is still clear – the Commission is, in principle, responsible for the implementation of the budget, and the Commission is fully accountable to Parliament in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">To sum up, devolution is a positive development. We are ready to follow the advice and instructions set out in the Court of Auditors report and in Mr Kaczmarek’s report in order to make it even better in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe that the EU should play a leading role in the fight against poverty, however I fear that the EU has lost sight of the objectives of international development. I am particularly concerned about the emphasis placed on how quickly the EU spends its money. Aid is not just about offloading millions of euros from the EU balance-sheet into the accounts of developing countries’ governments. While general and sectoral budget support may be efficient, we need to ask ourselves is it really effective? Is money spent on most vulnerable members of society? Is the system of checks and balances sufficient to ensure that EU aid is reaching those who need it the most? EU assistance must be of actual value. Delegations should focus on how many people they have helped rather than how many euros they have spent. The British public are generous and open-hearted and wish to help their fellow man. International development gets bad press when money is wasted, or worse, misappropriated. In order to reassure taxpayers that their money is well spent, the EU needs to do less better and realise that aid is more about how you spend rather than how much you spend.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I apologise for being late, but on the screen it was shown as being ten minutes later. I will give my presentation in Hungarian.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be the rapporteur for the report on modernising Europe’s higher education systems. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, as well as its expert and advisory groups, the shadow rapporteurs of the various Groups, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and all my dear colleagues, as well as the Committee of the Regions, the European University Association, and the various student representations who contributed to this report through considerable professional efforts, a constructive attitude and close cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One of the reasons why the task of rapporteur is important and represents a special challenge to me is that I come from a region of Central and Eastern Europe, and a country that recently acceded to the European Union, that is, Romania, where totalitarian dictatorship had placed barriers before the development of a system of higher educational institutions in the democratic sense, had showed gross disregard for the autonomy of universities, and had degraded the whole of educational policy to a stage and an instrument of social and political oppression. Bearing all this in mind, we can rightly and legitimately conclude that former communist countries that acceded to the EU have a twofold stake in the transformation and modernisation of higher education. To them it represents both a continuation of the democratic change of regime started in 1989 and of the fight against the crisis inherited from the past, and a process of catching up with the developed Western European Member States of the EU in the framework of the European Higher Education Area.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The 180 motions for amendment tabled for the draft report are another indication that in these times, when a complex crisis is afflicting our continent, the modernisation of the higher education system of Europe can be considered a call of the age. Accordingly, through the modernisation of higher education systems the report seeks to address the extraordinary challenges posed, among other factors, by the general economic crisis, the constraint of budgetary deficit, the increased rate of unemployment or the demographic crisis that continues to mount. Higher education is a common European value. Its reform is possible only in the context of a simultaneous involvement of EU, Member State and regional levels, taking account of the fact that higher education could play a key role in promoting social inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The report calls on higher education institutions to join efforts with each other and with their external partners, local governments, civil organisations and business sector participants to provide all social groups, including deprived people, with the possibility of pursuing studies in higher education. In this context the EU and Parliament also use this as an opportunity to take action against any form of discrimination and to stand up for the fundamental values of cultural and linguistic diversity. Accordingly, the report encourages Member States to pay special attention and provide financial support to higher education institutions serving national, ethnic and linguistic minorities. I will skip a part.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let me conclude my presentation by mentioning young people, who hold the key to our future. It is well known that in some Member States, especially in the societies of post-communist countries, there is an extremely high rate of youth unemployment. We hope that this report and the relevant EU policy and measures will, together with the Berlinguer report adopted in March, deliver a significant contribution to ensuring that European youth can have access to worthy employment opportunities and be able to make a living in accordance with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, I would like to thank rapporteur László Tőkés for his excellent report. It is the best report yet on the subject, and, along with the previous reports on this issue, is further proof of the European Parliament's efforts to modernise the European Higher Education Area.</p>
      <p sl="sl">For centuries in Europe, universities have been the source, the origin of progress and a cradle of values. This is how it must remain in the future, when we talk of third-generation or third-level universities. Therefore, they must be more open, especially to the economy, and establish, in the words of Mr Tőkés, a Knowledge Alliance.</p>
      <p sl="sl">To achieve more effective dialogue with universities, we must also increase our efforts in the economy. The competencies and skills needed should be published to enable them to modernise their curricula and study programmes. This will ensure consistency.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Of course, I still welcome the creation of new tools for U-Multirank, which should be a comprehensive ranking system, better than the scale we currently use.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, in connection with this report, I would like to voice my support for the successful Erasmus programme, which encourages mobility and multilingualism among university students. I would also like to emphasise that, in order for Europe to confront the ever fiercer competition on Asian markets, we must exploit every possible potential in science, research and the engineering professions. I am thinking here mainly of the unused potential of women who work in higher education and women who work in science.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There is no convincing reason in our century why, in the selection of a field of study and subsequently on the labour market as well, gender-based horizontal segregation should still persist. Perhaps this is because, even in higher education and in science, we often encounter traditional notions of the division of gender roles, which then become an accepted social norm.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I firmly believe, however, that we will not break away from the prevailing structures and traditional notions on the basis of quotas. These ideas have unfortunately been incorporated into the opinion on this report on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for which I was a rapporteur, but I must say here that I am fundamentally opposed to these mandatory measures.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Europe needs competitive universities offering curricula that meet the labour market’s requirements. I support the need to correlate the specialist courses offered by education institutions and the opportunity of obtaining employment, as specified in Article 27. The number of students in Romania has quadrupled in the last 20 years, but most of them experience difficulties in finding jobs to match their qualifications. Programmes are also needed to make it easier for graduates to find their first job and take part in ongoing vocational training. I should highlight how important it is for students to be involved in modernising higher education. On this point, I should mention the dissatisfaction expressed by student associations with regard to the Erasmus for All programme. The main criticisms concern the proposal’s shortcomings in areas such as non-formal education, interactive learning and the involvement of young people in democratic life.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the modernisation of European higher education systems in relation to the changing needs of the European economy and society is a challenge of a bold visionary reform that will not only help the EU to face global competition, but that also has the potential to return Europe to the forefront of the most dynamic economies in the world. In this regard, the higher education system must orientate itself more towards future business needs and provide the effective transfer of the most advanced knowledge and skills from universities directly into practice. In many Member States, we are currently witnessing a lack of university-qualified technical and scientific professionals and doctors together with an excess of humanities graduates, which has a negative effect on the employment situation and on research and development, innovation and, ultimately, economic growth. I will cut my contribution short, and thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I will not betray your trust in me and will finish two seconds before the time allocated. Mr President, Commissioner, there are a number of positive aspects to this report. These include its emphasis on the autonomy of higher education institutions, its support for the Erasmus programme, and the reference to the need to recognise qualifications acquired at home universities. The report also calls for action under the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) and cooperation with countries covered by this policy. Lastly, the report points out that the role of universities should not be reduced solely to their contribution to the economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, however, the report contains a number of worrying points, such as, for example, the introduction of uniform criteria for the creation of rankings of higher education institutions, and the requirement to spend at least one semester at a university other than the university to which the student is affiliated. This means that we will unfortunately have to abstain from supporting this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the so-called Bologna Process and the modernisation – in is broadest possible sense – of the higher education system has had disastrous aspects in Portugal. Rather than the trumpeted student mobility, what has happened is that higher education has been divided into two cycles and has consequently become elitist, thereby increasing higher education costs for the majority of students. There are students coming out of university today who have no money to pay their tuition fees, their living costs, or any of the other costs associated with being in higher education. For these students, the modernisation of the higher education system is merely a mirage.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European economy can overcome the current economic crisis if we focus greater attention on the education system, in particular higher education, as also stipulated in the Europe 2020 strategy. This will enable us to increase our economy’s global competitiveness in general. However, making competitive investments in higher education is not enough. It is important, rather, for us to facilitate the transition of young people to the labour market, especially as the unemployment rate among this group is twice as high as the general average.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, it is vital to ensure the quality of the actual education provided. With this in mind, I have suggested introducing a standard mechanism for monitoring and evaluating compliance with academic standards in both public and private higher education institutions. In this regard, I also support the importance of reciprocal recognition of professional qualifications in the EU, which allows the free movement of labour in a Europe facing increasingly serious demographic challenges. I wish to congratulate my colleague for this balanced report which is extremely pertinent for future generations.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I am certain that none of us would protest against the fact that the universities really will need to be modernised and that our university teaching programmes will have to be reviewed if we are truly to prepare young people for the labour market so that they are employable, and one of the options that we can apply right now is to encourage more women to enter into education, since we know that 60% of people leaving higher education are women. How is it possible that only 9% of them are running universities, for example? In other words, there really is a need to provide education for women and to offer them opportunities so that they can also lead and support universities or their faculties. Similarly, it is very important to support science and research in universities, not only to bring more women into science and research, but generally to promote science and research not only in universities but also in cooperation between universities, and I think that this is very well stated in the report by Mr Tökés. I would like to conclude with an idea that is very important to me. We were discussing the difference between loans and grants. I am very glad that Parliament has played a very important role in adopting the very clear position that we do not wish to support loans at the expense of grants, especially for socially disadvantaged groups.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a former educationalist myself, I could speak all night on this, but I do not have much time. I must say this is perhaps one of the best-thought-out proposals we have had before the European Parliament. I compliment the rapporteur and the Commission on the challenges it poses for the third-level institutes, particularly to meet the 2020 target of 40% students going on to third level and getting a qualification. It points out the challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">I suppose the main challenge is to link with the labour market, because that is going to be essential if we are going to be competitive on the world stage. It points out some things we need to do. One point with which I agree completely is that the gender equity situation is appalling for institutes that regard themselves as perhaps the most broadminded in the world. The emphasis on sport is very important, as is the potential in Erasmus.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final point I would like to make is that we should stop talking about professors and lecturers at third level. They should see themselves as teachers. If they teach, students will learn and then the economy will benefit.</p>

Having read his report and in light of our EU 2020 strategy, we all agree that we need to invest in education and increase the percentage of higher education graduates. At the same time, however, we can see the real reductions – of up to 10% − in government spending on higher education in numerous Member States, especially those under pressure from the economic crisis, which means the countries in the South. There are serious contradictions, therefore, between the objectives, between the announcements and reality.</p>
      <p sl="el">As education and modernising education, which are the subject of today’s debate, require practical results, not just findings, as investment in the knowledge triangle is a priority for growth in national economies, I should like to ask the Commission if it is considering proposing that the Member States exempt higher education from general cuts in government spending or if it will propose compensatory measures, because the public rightly finds it absurd that we are talking about modernisation, on the one hand, and, at the same time, are making massive cuts to higher education, on the other.</p>

One would therefore have legitimately expected to see an effort to infuse this report with the fundamental principles of Christianity on the one hand, and the representation of indigenous European minorities on the other. However, I find that the report is unfortunately lacking in this respect, because of its 74 points only one concerns minority higher education, and perhaps four points are about gender balance in higher education; I find this disproportionate, as not all countries are like Belgium where bilingualism is a given, and to this day we have Romania where at the university of Cluj-Napoca, for example, one is faced with difficulties when trying to put up Hungarian-language signposts. Thus, even though I have high regard for the work of Mr Tőkés, I cannot vote for it.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, quality education of the young is a basic requirement for the dynamic development of society. University education has a rich tradition in the European Union, and studying at a university is not only a question of social prestige for young people, but also an essential prerequisite for gaining a good job. The current economic problems, however, show us that the structure of higher education institutions does not correspond to the needs of a changing labour market, resulting in a high percentage of university graduates who cannot find suitable work in their field. We must therefore make more efforts to effectively bring higher education institutions closer to the needs of the labour market, so that the course structures offered by them correspond to the changing social and economic conditions. Support for university and higher education by Member States and the European Union is needed, but should be targeted only at those institutions whose graduates find suitable work in society after they leave higher education. Therefore, we must introduce new and better motivational criteria in their funding.</p>

Today’s report, however is a horizontal one, which means that the effects of the actions taken now may only be felt by future generations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe’s future competitiveness does indeed lie in the cultivation of innovation, skills, training and in the education of the younger generation. The entire system requires transformation, a process which, of course, must be driven by universities. Unfortunately, the latter are not competitive at the present time. We have been placed at the lower end of the Shanghai ranking, and I therefore think that effective implementation of the Youth in Action programme is essential. This programme runs in parallel with the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Programme, which thanks to the Commissioner, inter alios , now bears its full Polish name. We must, of course, invest in innovation and in competitiveness linked to research and the labour market. This is why it is so important for the future structural policy, the future Horizon 2020 programme, to be able to truly modernise universities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the name of the Commission I welcome the report by Mr Tőkés. We welcome Parliament’s voice on this issue (for the second time recently), so this is clearly very high on your agenda. It is a timely voice, as we are confronted with the following situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the one hand, nobody is denying that the knowledge-based economy is the future of Europe. On the other hand, education at a stressful time of austerity is one of the areas which is heavily cut in national budgets. In response to the comments of Mr Papanikolaou, I have to say that we are repeatedly underlining that, even in a time of austerity, training and education should be defended in the national budgets. Otherwise we are running the risk of undermining the future prospects of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also fully aware of the paradox of today’s Europe, which is that we are relatively well equipped with highly-qualified labour in our continent. On the other hand, we are confronted with a problem of structural unemployment, especially when it comes to what is already called a lost generation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The interplay between education and the labour market is thus a complex one, and we need reforms – and not only so we can move towards so-called global competitiveness. This must be done, as in the future the demand here will be for higher rather than lower qualifications. On the other hand we have to involve business communities and other partners in order to ensure that the graduates leaving our schools are equipped with useful employment skills (including vocational skills) and that this is not just producing unemployed people in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I acknowledge that Mr Tőkés’s report endorses the agenda proposed by the Commission in September 2011 involving the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and our multidimensional approach to the ranking of universities, youth opportunities and projects such as knowledge alliances.</p>
      <p sl="en">We appreciate what is needed in the partnership in order to ensure decent budgeting for a future generation of the programmes: the Institute; the Marie Curie programme (to be renamed Marie Skłodowska-Curie) and Erasmus For All. Let me clarify one point that is proposed by the Commission. The Erasmus Master Student Loan guarantee, a part of Erasmus For All, is an additional tool supporting students which is complementary to the grants, which will remain the major engine of our programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">What comes in the future is not only about reinforcing good education but also concerns supporting education partnerships. One more, Mr Tőkés, thank you for the really constructive tone of your report.</p>

Before all else I would like to highlight the role of sport in education, to which the report clearly calls attention in several points. I find it essential that despite the crisis we maintain stable financing for European higher education, both from Member State funding and from the EU budget. I agree with the rapporteur that we must ensure the continued funding and development of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology seated in Budapest. I submitted a proposal requesting that the Commission draft a strategy for the mitigation of regional differences between Western and Central and Eastern European higher education institutions.

      <p sl="en">Although Europe has around 19 million students and more than 4000 higher education institutions, currently only 26% of the workforce has high-level qualifications. Responsibility for higher education rests mainly with Member States and the higher education institutions themselves. They face a number of challenges at present. These include the question of graduate numbers, improving access to higher education, and adapting syllabuses to meet labour market requirements. This is one of the possibilities that would enable graduates to gain employment corresponding to the education they have acquired. Monitoring of professional employment and the availability of internationally comparable data on graduates can help higher education institutions to better fulfil their roles. In the context of the current economic crisis, it is important that higher education institutions continue to be well funded. It is pleasing that access to education is improving for people from all social backgrounds. In connection with this, however, schools must cope with an increase in the number of students and a varied student base. They frequently also adapt their teaching methods to students with different needs. I firmly believe that, in order to modernise higher education, it will be necessary to take steps so that Member States do not fall behind the higher education provided elsewhere in the world. European higher education must move forward if we are to maintain, or even improve, Europe’s global competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I find the report of Mr Tőkés concerning higher education to be highly important. We all know that the acquisition of high-quality, truly useful and usable knowledge is in the interest of present and future generations, and the whole of Europe. The higher education institutions of our time must offer competitive knowledge, and must do so by following actual demands on the labour market. In this context, I would like to specifically highlight the issue of the access of national minorities to higher education in their native language. The motto of the European Union is ‘United in diversity’. The preservation of cultural and linguistic diversity therefore requires that these national minority communities are able to preserve their distinctiveness, represent their interests and stand up for the rights to which they are entitled. To this end, however, national minorities, similar to majority societies, need well-educated leadership, an elite. And in order to have such an elite – possessing reliable, competitive knowledge – to represent the interests of these communities, there is definitely a need for high-standard, high-quality and not the least native-language higher education, and for the majority society to support and guarantee such education. Majority societies should therefore give special attention and support to the higher education institutions of traditional national, ethnic and linguistic minorities, in particular where endangered cultures and languages are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="it">Education means using intelligent methods to give expression to each person’s intrinsic potential. Increasing education, training and research is a cornerstone of growth and modernisation in higher education. However, the success of tertiary education also depends on policies to improve the social inclusion of minorities, gender equality and cutting the number of school-leavers. On top of these goals, there is the aim of encouraging institutions to systematically integrate mobility for education purposes within their programmes. Suitable funding is, however, required in order to achieve this: currently it is just 1.3% of gross domestic product, compared with 2.7% in the USA. Language skills are, moreover, in high demand among businesses and good skills in this area improve job prospects. Also connected to this is the equally important subject of e -learning: the fusion of education and computer literacy, which provides innovative ways for teaching new generations. Europe’s future strength in this area will depend on putting higher education at the heart of innovation, creating jobs and employable skills, and on the ability of higher education institutions to play a full role in the knowledge triangle: connecting teaching, research and business to boost excellence and regional development.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to warmly congratulate my colleague László Tőkés for his report on modernising Europe’s higher education systems, which rightly calls on Member States and higher education institutions to widen access for students from all social backgrounds, since higher education has the potential to promote social inclusion and upward social mobility, benefiting disadvantaged communities in a complex way, with its positive socio-economic impacts reaching far beyond the individual concerned. The attendance of disadvantaged young people and especially of Roma in higher education institutions is astoundingly low. Aid mechanisms, such as scholarships and mentoring support, should be established therefore for young Roma, to inspire them not only to obtain diplomas but also to enrol in higher education establishments. A system of perks should also be considered, which would increase the participation of Roma youth in such institutions and improve their qualifications. It is also very important to keep track of the employment outcomes of graduates and to measure how higher education responds to labour market demands. The Commission and Member States therefore need to collect and publish statistical data regarding the correlation between different higher education degrees and employment opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report calls for the modernisation of higher education systems. It shows that more than one third of the population should have a university-level qualification by 2020. In the report, the author makes an incorrect reference to ‘high level qualifications’. In my experience, there is a very loose connection between a college degree and high level qualifications. It is correctly said that Member States are responsible for higher education, despite which there have been repeated attempts over the years to declare certain types of higher education to be the best. A typical example of the failure of such attempts is the large-scale churning out of ‘practically oriented’ bachelor degrees under the Bologna Declaration. Most university lecturers - particularly from technical fields where there is a real need for sound expertise, and where the results of studies are relatively easy to compare between individual institutions - agree that bachelor level university studies should form the theoretical basis for further engineering or masters studies. Student loans are not considered a real support or an improvement in study conditions, either at home or abroad. They are an attempt to restrict, using social censorship, the possibility of studying for students from low-income families, and instead to support the richest in making a start in life after studies. The reference to lifelong learning looks very artificial. I would therefore like to express my profound discomfort over this report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It is an unfortunate fact that in most Member States even people with higher education qualifications are having an increasingly difficult time finding employment, and I therefore consider it important to modernise higher education systems and implement reforms. The economic crisis has resulted in major budgetary cuts in education, despite the fact that it is primarily vocational training and higher education that are in need of modernisation in order to combat the crisis. It is this area where there is the greatest need for a reform programme in order to be able to keep pace with the new demands of a rapidly changing labour market and organisation of work. We must be able to give up-to-date responses to challenges. Therefore, sustainable higher education must continue to be based on state investments, thus providing as many people as possible with access to higher education. The establishment of new lines of study must reflect the labour market demands of the various countries. This can only be ensured through research, surveys, and continuous and mutual cooperation with corporations. The number of European students graduating abroad is continuously rising, but there are unfortunately still problems in respect of the mutual recognition of degrees, which also presents a disadvantage in terms of employment. I agree that Member States should reinforce cooperation between their competent ministries in the field of higher education with a view to ensuring the mutual recognition of degrees and qualifications and improving their harmonisation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The modernisation of Europe’s higher education systems needs to be a wide-ranging process encompassing, amongst others, procedural, financial, and organisational aspects. The concept of lifelong learning is worth promoting and achieving via the introduction of specific study programmes provided by higher education institutions. The curricula of higher education institutions should be revised on a continuous basis in order to respond to economic requirements, in particular, to those of the rapidly changing labour market. At the same time, efforts should be made to achieve continuous scientific and technological progress. An appropriate level of academic standards should be maintained and constantly monitored at both public and private higher education institutions. As the rapporteur rightly observed, the central issue is to broaden access to higher education, making it available to as many Europeans as possible in order to deal with the economic crisis more effectively and to enhance Europe’s competitiveness. Consequently, cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises and higher education institutions should serve to facilitate the exchange of information regarding the demand for workers with specific skill sets and competencies, as well as enabling students to take part in professional traineeships. It is very important to support and promote student mobility schemes, as the latter enable students to gain new experiences and subsequently to disseminate best practices in their home universities.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the report on modernising Europe’s higher education systems, as I am convinced that the global competitiveness of the European Union depends on Member State activities in this field. I am particularly pleased to note that the report calls on Member States to pay increased attention to, and to support higher education and institutions serving traditional national, ethnic or linguistic minorities. This call is highly important because at institutions providing education in the language of indigenous national minorities as well, we can often see attempts to suffocate or diminish minority language education. At least this is what was happening in Eastern Europe during the communist era, and in some cases unfortunately continues to this day. We, Hungarians of Transylvania, are currently trying to mitigate the effects of these destructive efforts, and it is our resolute intention to ensure the completeness of the network of Hungarian-language higher education. Unfortunately in our efforts we cannot always count on cooperation from our Romanian colleagues, which is why it is very important for the position of the European institutions to confirm our objectives.</p>

      <p sl="de">The creation of a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is an important means of ensuring that Europe can maintain and develop its global competitiveness. What is needed most importantly is increased mobility for students. A variety of programmes, such as Erasmus, have made a significant contribution to Europe’s current leading position in the world. Internally, programmes like this help to enhance the feeling of solidarity within Europe. Unfortunately, in many Member States the implementation of the Bologna process has resulted in many students being unwilling to include periods of study abroad in their courses. The increasing pressure to perform which is being applied by some universities in this context also makes it more difficult for students to be mobile and this is something which is very important. Therefore, in the next stages of the reform process we must give priority to ensuring that we do not make students even more unwilling to study abroad. In addition to the Commission’s programmes, we also need institutional incentives as part of the process of reforming study courses.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in 2010 the European Commission adopted the EU 2020 strategy aimed at creating smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and improving economic governance. One of the seven flagship initiatives of Europe’s growth strategy is the Digital Agenda for Europe, a strategy for leveraging the potential offered by the rapid progress made by digital technologies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Parliament welcomes the adoption of the European e Government Action Plan 2011-2015, the European Interoperability Strategy and the European Interoperability Framework for European public services, and calls on Member States to take prompt action to align their national strategies with these overarching policies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">High impact services are important for cost savings, cross-border interoperability and for achieving the single market. Given that the public procurement market accounts for 16% of the European Union’s GDP and that SMEs make up 99% of EU enterprises, particular attention must be focused on the cross-border interoperability of e -procurement systems and on the large-scale adoption of e -invoicing. If fully available and more widely used, it could reduce public procurement costs by as much as 30%. However, 14 and 12 Member States respectively are already at the implementation stage for the pre-awarding and post-awarding phases.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We also appreciate the initiatives from Denmark, Finland, Italy, Spain and Sweden to make e -invoicing mandatory for public authorities, and call for e -invoicing to be made mandatory for all public procurement transactions by 2016. Key enablers, in particular electronic identity management, interoperability and open standards, are the most important prerequisites for successful e -government that is interoperable at European level. Member States should review the requirements of their e -signature framework in order to remove the barriers hampering cross-border services.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call on the Commission to table as soon as possible a proposal for revising the e Signature Directive in order to ensure cross-border recognition and interoperability of secure e -authentication systems and the decision on mutual recognition of e -identification and e -authentication across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Parliament emphasises that interoperable cross-border e -government services should benefit from an innovative architecture and technologies, public cloud services and Service-Oriented Architecture, and calls for the IPv6-level e -government infrastructure and online services of public interest to be upgraded. A secure cross-border e -government system is an integral part of the European Critical Infrastructure Protection programme.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We welcome the contribution of the IDA, IDABCD and ISA programmes and the large-scale pilots, as well as of the e Practice forum in terms of designing and implementing cross-border interoperable solutions. Parliament endorses the ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ proposal, which allocates around EUR 9.2 billion to support investment in fast and ultra-fast broadband networks and pan-European digital services. Parliament underlines that the Connecting Europe Facility will provide grants for building the infrastructure needed to roll out e -ID, e -identification, e -government, e -procurement, e -health, e -justice and customs-related services, and will be instrumental in ensuring interoperability and meeting the costs of running the infrastructure at European level, linking up Member States’ infrastructures.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur. There is a general but very crucial assumption that we must make on this subject and that will direct our future policies in this sector. Today, in a very difficult economic environment, there are divergences between the Member States in terms of the provision of online services and these differences are, in turn, creating a serious competitive divide.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is not, therefore, just the labour cost; it is not just general fiscal policies; it is also the opportunities, the transparency and the certainty that give a State that makes extensive use of new technologies in its transactions with the public and with businesses that are interested in investing in it a comparative advantage. This needs to be understood. A lack of eGovernment means a lack of competition for the Member States and, in addition to the hundreds of millions of euros budgeted under the Structural Funds, we need an extensive exchange of best practices and experience in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Ms Ţicău for drafting this excellent report. Advanced digital services offer opportunities for improving and updating public services for citizens and businesses. They improve the efficiency and transparency of government business.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the moment, a large proportion of public services in Member States are facing major challenges. e -government can make the public sector instrumental in the development of the economy and society. It also promotes economic growth and addresses the social and political challenges which the EU is facing. I think that having a European e Governance Area for cross-border transactions and SMEs will help strengthen the digital single market. I welcome the numerous benefits that e -government can bring, especially to the disadvantaged groups in the population.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to start by applauding the efforts of Ms Ţicău to give new impetus to the issue of building eGovernment. In addition to the advantages of electronic communication with public administration already described, I would like to draw attention to the need to define at least the basic IT compatibility standards for public administration institutions that will gradually enter into the process. I think it is very important that operating systems and the applications based on them used by citizens, are able to communicate with each other. At present, for example, operating systems such as Microsoft, Android and others are used, and they do not work correctly for some applications and some devices. Therefore, if we want to build a public administration at the EU level or even to communicate with each other between the various institutions, it will be necessary for these operating systems and applications to understand each other and create together the integrated system that we wish to achieve.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has definitely made us aware of three things: that bureaucracy must be reduced, administration must be accelerated, and savings must be made. This is especially important in light of what Ms Țicău has said, namely that SMEs account for 99% of the corporate world. Digitalisation and e -governance could make a major contribution in this regard. The fact is that while the report also considers consolidation important, there is nothing to consolidate in Eastern Europe, because this system is barely functioning there, making its development particularly important and deserving of European Union support. However, this system raises two very serious concerns. First, data protection must be guaranteed in some way. To companies, data protection is also a high priority due to economic competition. The second basic principle should be for the authorities’ competence to cover only their own nation states.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the information and communication technologies that the rapporteur, Ms Ţicău, has spoken about have become a common part of everyday life of modern man and significantly affect economics, politics and society in general. The sector generates as much as 5% of GDP in the EU and contributes significantly to overall productivity growth. The real potential of the information and communication technologies sector remains untapped, given the many barriers to the single digital market. I consider one of the biggest limitations to be the limited cross-border provision of electronic and telecommunication services, which leads to the creation of unequal conditions for the provision of the same services in different Member States. Such internal market barriers and differences between the infrastructure development levels in the Member States must be systematically removed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to congratulate Ms Ticău on the tremendous work she has done in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on this eGovernment dossier. I would like to thank the Commission for its work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to make three comments. First, we need assurance that we have the coverage that will enable us to use all these new technologies across the entire European continent. This is an important factor for the competitiveness of our continent. In the canton of Meymac, in Corrèze, of which I am the elected representative, and also in Limousin and Auvergne, not all of our territory is covered, and this is a real problem. We need to achieve 100% coverage within the European Union and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, government must not, under the guise of making life easier, become more complex. We, the citizens, are tired of excessive complexity and bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to make a comment concerning the siting of officials. These new technologies must enable officials to stay where they are and give them the possibility of teleworking with their central administration, thanks precisely to eGovernment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, again I would like to compliment Mrs Ţicău, who gave a tremendous summary of where we need to go in this area and how we should get there.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are talking about a market, and there are three adjectives associated with it in the title: competitive, digital and single. They are all equally important. Certainly in relation to e-government as a spearhead, there are great opportunities there in terms of e-justice, e-customer services, e-governance, e-health and also, of course, the possibility of developing e-commerce.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a sad fact in many ways that 75% of SMEs do not trade outside the European Union and 87% do not trade outside their own country. So the potential is vast. But as my colleague, Jean-Pierre Audy, pointed out, the most important thing to establish is high-speed broadband across the European Union. Then we can create a competitive digital and single market.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European e Government Action Plan offers an opportunity to revamp European and national administrations by significantly cutting costs and encouraging growth, innovation and mobility at regional level. The role of ICT in local and regional public administration helps increase transparency and accountability to citizens, while reducing administrative burdens and costs. In some Member States it actively removes the barriers preventing administrative reform. e -government entails improving and making administrative procedures flexible. A set of rules needs to be produced as a priority at different levels of administration regarding certain criteria for the public procurement system, standardising and defining the legal capacity of digital signatures and for implementing e -government cloud platforms. We have implemented cross-border projects whose implementation has often been hindered by technological constraints or by the lack of coordination between neighbouring countries. This is why I insist on the need to develop interoperable cross-border services in the area of ICT. I congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent report she presented.</p>

    <intervention id="4-678-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the report on e-government by Mrs Ţicău is very important and timely and rightly places e-government in the context of a digital agenda and the 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree that e-government is a window of opportunity to modernise and simplify the public sector and make it more cost-efficient as well as user-friendly. Mrs Ţicău, you rightly underline in your report the strength of the ICT sector in Europe, which contributes, as mentioned, 5% of GDP of the European Union market value of EUR 660 billion. It also contributes 50% of overall productivity growth, which is also important.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can therefore imagine the potential of this digital market if it could be completely free of barriers. At the moment, both citizens and businesses face many barriers when accessing public services online in another country. This is mainly the responsibility of the Member States. However, in order to enhance the action plan by 2015, the Commission will table a pan-European framework for electronic identification, authentication and signatures at the level of European cooperation by June 2012. This will, firstly, address the issue of interoperability and usability and, secondly, remove the barriers. It will also to address the new requirements: new trusted services and the mutual recognition of and acceptance of electronic identification and signatures.</p>
      <p sl="en">We take note of – and, what is more, we support – your efforts to make e-invoicing predominant in Europe by 2020. However, we should take account of the requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises within the consistent regulatory framework. We also take note of your ambitious call to the Member States to make e-invoicing mandatory in public procurement by 2016.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, funding is needed for the future in the areas of electronic identification, e-procurement, e-justice and e-health, and it should be provided primarily by the Connecting Europe Facility. In order to achieve all this, we need cooperation. The goal is a modern, user-friendly digital single market in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Due to the rapid development of information technology we are transacting an increasingly large share of our business over the Internet or by mobile phone. It is welcome that several Member States have recently begun to make use of technological innovations in the field of government services. It has become increasingly clear to decision-makers that the use of electronic government services represents a major improvement for both EU citizens’ quality of life and the efficient operation of Member State public administration. Electronic administration has also become more prevalent in Hungary over the past few years. Hungary’s example has provided practical confirmation for one of the main points of the report, namely that citizens can save time and money through flexible and fast online administration. Online customer portals allow us to transact our business from home or from the office, sparing ourselves hours of administration and a myriad of forms. The introduction of e -governance is supported not only by the citizens but also by the business sector, because it greatly diminishes administrative burdens, thereby enhancing the productivity of enterprises. That said, the greatest beneficiary of the proliferation of electronic administration is the public sector. This is because electronic governance increases the efficiency of data management, while reducing operational costs and errors. Despite good Member State examples and initial success, however, we cannot sit back and relax, because the development of information technology is opening up new avenues for improving efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In 2010, the European Commission adopted the 2020 strategy, which aims to create smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. One of the seven initiatives for this European growth is the Digital Agenda for Europe. The primary goal of the Digital Agenda is the most effective use of ICT and the creation of innovative eGovernment. According to our data, more than 65% of the EU population regularly uses the Internet. Broadband coverage has reached 95.3%. The average accessibility of online public services achieved in 2010 was 82%. I would therefore like to draw your attention to the need to include educational institutions and the use of educational software in these programmes. One of the main challenges is to address the digital literacy of EU citizens, because limited literacy is the greatest obstacle to the full and effective use of the available technology.</p>

    <intervention id="4-680-750" speaker_id="96718" name="Olga Sehnalová" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="en">The successful implementation of eGovernment will facilitate communications between public administration authorities and citizens and businesses, while also involving the public more in the democratic process of policy making, through transparent public consultations. Unfortunately, there are still groups of citizens, for example pensioners, who lack sufficient access to online services, and for them eGovernment services will therefore be hard to access. Although citizens over 65 years of age have been the fastest growing group of Internet users in recent years in my own country, they still account for just 13% of citizens. We should therefore try to ensure that the use of these services does not lead to a deepening of the digital divide and of social differences, but rather to the positive benefits mentioned earlier. Education plays a key role, in my opinion. We must improve literacy and the access of citizens to information and communications technologies, and ensure that all social groups can make use of eGovernment services on a genuinely large-scale basis. Only thus will we make full use of the considerable potential for developing online services in a digital Europe. At the same time, however, we must not forget those who will always have very limited access to - and links with - the Internet, and we must not, in this context, allow the emergence of a group of citizens who are stuck in an information and communications vacuum.</p>
