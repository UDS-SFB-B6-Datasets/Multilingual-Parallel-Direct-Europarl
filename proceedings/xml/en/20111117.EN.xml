      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Georgios Koumoutsakos, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Programme to support the further development of an integrated maritime policy [COM(2010)0494 - C7-0292/2010 - 2010/0257(COD) ] (Α6-0163/2011).</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the integrated maritime policy is a new Union policy. It is a dynamic policy with a great deal of potential and numerous promising prospects. The benefits from coordinating and cooperating on the numerous economic activities connected with the sea are, I believe, self-evident.</p>
      <p sl="el">The integrated maritime policy will not only benefit the coastal states. The whole of Europe and the European economy will benefit, as the web of economic activities bound up with the sea stretches far and wide and their impact is felt directly by the entire economy and by large sections of the population. We should not forget that man’s economic activities at sea and on shore generate 40% of EU GDP and, according to forecasts, there is still great potential for growth.</p>
      <p sl="el">If we coordinate and cooperate on ocean-going shipping and short-haul shipping, fisheries and aquaculture, renewable energy sources and protection of the maritime environment, coastal tourism and the development of island areas, this web of activities will maximise the potential for sustainable development, employment and innovation. That is why it is extremely important for us to promote integrated maritime governance, as provided for in the integrated maritime policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">The question that arises is this: will all this be possible with the limited budget of EUR 40 million for between now and 2012 provided for in the regulation under discussion? Obviously not. We are talking here about a new policy which is in the very early stages of application and, as we all well know, even the longest journey starts with a first step. What we need in order to make the journey – any journey – a success, including this journey, is for this first step to be firm and decisive. It needs to be made with faith and optimism in the success of the ultimate objective. This faith, decisiveness and dynamism are successfully reflected in the regulation on which we shall vote today. As for the future, the text emphasises – and this is an important point – that the integrated maritime policy should be included in the financial perspective 2014-2021.</p>
      <p sl="el">I also wish to highlight the particular importance of the international aspect of the integrated maritime policy and cooperation under it with third countries. This cooperation will bring tangible returns if based on respect for the international law of the sea and the relevant international conventions, especially the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which forms an integral part of the Community acquis . All this is set out clearly in the text of the resolution we shall be voting on, which is another important point.</p>
      <p sl="el">As far as general objectives are concerned, on which I shall comment briefly, it is important to make provision for measures that promote the development and application of integrated maritime and coastal governance; contribute to the utilisation of cross-sectoral instruments, especially maritime planning and the common information exchange platform; promote protection of the maritime environment and biodiversity; support the development and application of sea-basin strategies; improve and strengthen external cooperation and the international aspects of the policy; and, finally, support sustainable development, growth and employment and innovation and new technologies in all coastal, island and outermost regions of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I believe that we have done a good job today. We can vote on a good financing regulation to support a dynamic new Union policy. May I thank everyone – there are too many to name – who worked to bring about this positive result today. The negotiations and discussions were long and complex and lasted several months. I must highlight the excellent cooperation on the part of the Commission and with the two Council Presidencies and, above all, the excellent cooperation and support given to me by the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Mr Koumoutsakos, I wish to thank you for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed and for everything you have contributed to the present debate. I can endorse everything you said today. This is just the first step, but we have made an important start.</p>
      <p sl="el">Madam President, this is a very important moment for our integrated maritime policy (IMP). While money is not the only issue, this is a start: we have had a difficult year of negotiations and now we have the possibility of the IMP being provided with its own financial base. So I am very pleased that we have come this far.</p>
      <p sl="el">What we are talking about from now on is no longer a fledgling policy but an independent policy, and that is the most important aspect of this discussion. We now have a free-standing maritime policy that can tap the economic potential of the sea, can boost growth and jobs and can contribute to the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="el">I have already thanked Mr Koumoutsakos, but I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the Fisheries Committee and the other committees for their contributions, which have enabled us to come this far. Let me stress once more that your support for this package today will help us deliver concrete results tomorrow – and that is what we aim to do. Until now we have been relying on the preparatory actions and pilot projects that we had put forward in 2008, but these could be financed only until the end of 2010. Your support today will ensure that the ongoing initiatives do not have to be stopped midway, before they can actually bear fruit.</p>
      <p sl="el">The negotiations we have been holding with you and the Council have led us to extend the operational objectives but, above all, they have helped us at the Commission to understand your expectations better: they have made it crystal clear that we should give priority only to actions of a truly integrated nature that cannot be funded elsewhere. So this is how we intend to use this amount of money: EUR 40 million is not a large sum, but we are going to fund only projects which cannot be funded elsewhere, including in the fields of maritime spatial planning, maritime surveillance and marine knowledge. We intend to take a sea-basin approach: we are going to develop sea-basin strategies and cross-cutting tools that will help coastal communities and regions to expand their economies.</p>
      <p sl="el">If this regulation is adopted, the Commission will shortly propose a work programme detailing the specific actions we intend to launch, based on the general and operational objectives defined in the regulation for 2011-2013.</p>
      <p sl="el">In conclusion, this compromise package seems well balanced both in terms of policy expectations and in terms of the means provided for effective and timely delivery. I certainly look forward to hearing your views in the debate because I think we can work together.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I rise on behalf of my fellow MEP and member of the Committee on Budgets, Dominique Riquet, who would first like to commend the work done by Georgios Koumoutsakos on this issue. I think that we can all welcome the consensus observed between the European institutions and between the various political groups on the need to ensure the future development of the integrated maritime policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In continuing the exploratory work begun with the preparatory actions and the pilot projects, we are ensuring that the European Union’s maritime ambitions are reflected in all the sectors concerned: environment, transport, energy, research, industry, fisheries and regional policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Looking beyond this support, and because the integrated maritime policy needs to flourish, we have to ensure better management of expenditure in this area. In this regard, the conclusions of the trialogue seem to me to be a good compromise. The envelope proposed – EUR 40 million over the period 2011-2013 – does not jeopardise the funding of other policies, and a mid-term report on the state of play of the integrated maritime policy is also due in December 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On behalf of my colleague Mr Riquet, I should like to say that we are simply sorry that the European Parliament has not been involved more in the drafting of the work programme for this policy, which will be adopted by means of an implementing act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we now need to ensure that funding for the policy is secure in the next multiannual financial framework.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014-000" speaker_id="96811" name="Rosa Estaràs Ferragut" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, the coastal regions, seas and oceans are undoubtedly of fundamental importance for the economic growth of the European Union and all its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Following the Commission’s communication, an ‘Action Plan for an integrated maritime policy for the European Union’, known as the ‘Blue Book’, we are now in the current situation where the idea of an integrated maritime policy is welcome, and what it does and aims to do is certainly to make better use of the opportunities the sea provides.</p>
      <p sl="es">They know that this idea will form the basis for specific environmental and maritime transport policies which are so important for all these areas and for energy, research, fishing and regional policies. All of these aspects are, of course, vital for all these regions.</p>
      <p sl="es">I myself, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, fully support the proposal for a regulation and, furthermore, we believe that the EUR 40 million allocated for the current 2011-2013 period is sufficient. I should also like to say that it would be necessary for this funding to continue into the future, after 2014, since we need to consolidate the process that has been initiated and thereby ensure the continuation of such a promising course of action.</p>
      <p sl="es">I should also like to say that there should be a consistent approach to all the seas within the European Union so that we can see the range of projects and gain real first-hand knowledge of what the issues are in each sea basin.</p>
      <p sl="es">Clearly, the problems of the North Sea are not the same as those of the Mediterranean; hence, it would be valuable to adopt a consistent approach in order to discover more about this diversity.</p>
      <p sl="es">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various opinions that have been drafted to finalise a programme which we see as of great importance for the future of the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016-000" speaker_id="96849" name="Alain Cadec" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the huge potential of the sea is a decisive factor in the competitiveness of the European Union, particularly in the areas of sustainable development, safety at sea and on land, and energy and food supplies, which are also objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A link is being established between new and innovative sectors and the traditional maritime sectors of fishing and maritime transport. These new sectors include, for example, the creation of offshore wind parks, investment in technology relating to wave energy, offshore aquaculture and that which is referred to as ‘blue technology’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can therefore say that the integrated maritime policy (IMP) is regarded as a key priority for sustainable growth in the European Union. The IMP promotes synergies between all EU policies relating to the oceans, the seas and, hence, the coast of Europe. This policy must result in more robust action spread across the various areas of the IMP and in a better cost-efficiency ratio of investments in the maritime sector. That is why proper financial provision must be made for the IMP, which must be implemented quickly to ensure smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our rapporteur, Maria do Céu Patrão Neves, who cannot be here today, had the pleasure of working on this report on the IMP with our colleague, Georgios Koumoutsakos, who spoke earlier.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am grateful to them both; they have done an excellent job. They have based their work on pilot projects and on IMP-related preparatory actions that ended in late 2010. It is important to ensure that funding for these actions continues until 2013. As from 2013, the IMP will have to rely on a specific financial instrument: the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report provides the IMP with a stable financial framework for the period 2011-2012 by granting it a budget of 40 million, as Commissioner Damanaki said. We hope that the budget will be sufficient to meet a wide range of objectives linked to the development of European cross-sectoral maritime activities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Koumoutsakos on his excellent work. The proposal in question aims to provide the integrated maritime policy with a stable financial framework for the 2011-2013 period by establishing a financial envelope of around EUR 50 million. The proposed sum, while on the low side, represents a reasonable basis and will have to be increased in the future.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also believe that it is necessary to allocate specific resources to develop and strengthen the integrated maritime policy in the next multiannual financial period starting in 2014. This is of vital importance in order to ensure that all the progress and investments already made are not wasted. The process of defining the next financial perspective has already begun, and given that the integrated maritime policy figures among the EU’s priorities, consistency demands that this policy be awarded adequate funds sufficiently in advance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today more than ever, we need not only to continue in this direction, but also and especially to renew and strengthen maritime policy in the EU, keeping in mind our responsibilities in this sector and starting from the point of view that it is possible to reconcile an increase in economic maritime activities with protection of the environment, and to develop a link between the two by putting in place suitable governance and appropriate cross-cutting mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I believe that the first objective in strengthening the integrated maritime policy must be to encourage maximisation of the sustainable exploitation of the oceans while encouraging the growth of maritime industries and coastal regions. I also believe that the promotion of sustainable development, the protection and use of coastal maritime resources, and the development of individualised sea basin strategies should be included among the programme’s general objectives, which should be substantiated by more specific rules on spending, and that the European Parliament should be appropriately involved in its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, we need to continue with the creation of a basis of knowledge and innovation, and for this purpose, it is essential to present a global European strategy for marine and maritime research. In this context, the European Union has already taken its first important steps, by providing EUR 3.9 million in funding to the European Marine Biological Research Centre, an executive project with its institutional and administrative base in Naples, Italy. Therefore, Madam President and Commissioner, I believe it is right to continue along this road.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was wonderful to work with Mr Koumoutsakos. We worked well together, we had a good trialogue, and therefore my thanks are not merely formal but truly meant. We have become friends during this debate, and I think this friendship will probably lead us to give the Commission a hand because, Commissioner, the problem is the future.</p>
      <p sl="it">What we have achieved today has been thanks to Parliament, because if it had been down to the Council – incidentally absent today – we would not have achieved this result. A proposal of EUR 50 million was cut by the Council, and it is only thanks to the tough stand taken by myself and Mr Koumoutsakos that the Commission has been able to receive this EUR 40 million.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission can count on us for the future. It can count on a Parliament that believes in what it says. This Parliament is convinced to the extent that it knows perfectly well that the sea is made up of seas, coastlines and activities, and that there needs to be a common vision of these things. Coastlines cannot be the subject of urban and land planning that ends at the foreshore. The EU and Member States need to appreciate that town planning includes the sea – it does not end on the coastline.</p>
      <p sl="it">The activities themselves need to become compatible with one another. We need to initiate real planning in which tourism, fishing, mining and – why not? – the amazing wind energy that can be developed offshore can be an asset and mutually compatible, in the same way that fishing and fishing activities cannot be treated separately and considered only in terms of fishing methods and quantities. There, the focus will have to be on pollution-related issues, because dwindling fish stocks are not just the result of fishing.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, you have a major ally in Parliament. The problem will not be how to spend this EUR 40 million, but how we will all manage to have sufficient resources between 2013 and 2020 to do such important and wonderful things.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I would like to thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak on this very important matter, the development of the European Union’s integrated maritime policy, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Ireland is one of the true maritime nations of the European Union. We possess ten times more territory offshore than on land. We must capitalise on our vast marine resource so as to create, and of course to maintain, sustainable economic growth and jobs for coastal communities in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The Maritime Institute, which was visited by Commissioner Damanaki and her Irish colleague, based in my Euro-constituency in Galway is to the forefront in developing new possibilities through different initiatives with economic sectors as diverse as ICT, food biotechnology, shipping, financial services, ocean energy and new research into deep-sea species. The development of Killybegs in my own county as a renewable energy services hub, the regional plan for the Shannon Estuary and the WestWave project are concrete examples of new initiatives being developed off the Irish coastline at present.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The launch of the integrated strategy for the Atlantic area, which will take place in Lisbon on 28 November, is an important development. I strongly believe and support a coordinated strategy for the Atlantic area from the north of Scotland, through Ireland, through France, through Spain and Portugal. I believe all of that will result in economic benefits for coastal communities located along the Atlantic arc.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I want to give an example of how we can regenerate. I believe that regeneration of the infrastructural facilities in many small coastal ports and islands along this arc, including my own country, would result in tangible benefits. I am thinking in particular of the ports that have suffered as a result of the decline in fish landings. We have an obligation to assist these people and their ports. I believe that a small investment via the Fisheries Fund – or indeed the Cohesion Fund or through this EUR 40 million – could provide water-based facilities such as marinas and will provide better facilities for tourists and leisure crafts.</p>
      <p sl="ga">This is not necessarily a new concept. If we look at the Common Agricultural Policy, there is an envelope of funding within that for rural development. I want to highlight one sentence from the Commissioner’s statement today. She wants to help coastal communities to extend their economies and I welcome that statement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Greens support the measures contained in the Koumoutsakos report today, and welcome the opportunity we have for an agreement at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is necessary – as has been so eloquently pointed out by other speakers – to provide some interim funding so that proper allocations can start from 2013. As it happens, we were unable to secure the amount originally envisaged, but nevertheless there is EUR 40 million available from unspent budget allocations. That money will go towards integrating maritime policy around the development of short sea shipping, the detection of illegal fishing, the integration of sea-basin strategies and maritime surveillance and, importantly, protection of the marine environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have particularly enjoyed working with the rapporteur. We now welcome the opportunity to work in partnership with other agencies, notably the European Maritime Safety Agency with its SafeSeaNet programme. Colleagues, please use your vote later today to support this jolly good idea.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent performance. The integrated maritime policy is important for numerous spheres of the EU economy. It also forms part of the cultural heritage and is an element of public awareness. Given its huge importance, the European Commission must treat this report with special attention. Lack of explicit and clear regulations in the sphere of the maritime economy is one of the reasons behind the collapse of this industry.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A question suggests itself: why are most vessels manufactured outside of the European Union? What explanation is there for businesses also having their vessels registered outside of the European Union? And finally, why does being employed as a sailor or a fisherman command such little prestige? There are many more similar questions here and all of them should be answered if the maritime economy were to be treated seriously. Given the lack of a good and favourable law, yet another industry shall be lost to the Far Eastern countries that have created favourable conditions for the development of the maritime industry.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is primarily a blow to the innovation economy, for the maritime industry is a source of innovativeness, which is the motto on the banners of the European Union. In my country, Poland, as a consequence of the decision made by the European Commission, the government has dismantled the shipbuilding industry and provided no other alternative, while the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline, contrary to international conventions, has completely blocked the development of Polish ports. As an MEP and a former sailor, I urge the Commission to choose the adequate approach to the issue of the maritime economy.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I could paraphrase Hemingway and say: ‘Europe and the Sea’, because Europe is surrounded by the sea and over half of all Europeans live within 50 kilometres of the coast. Obviously, therefore, the sea is an important factor in Community growth and growth policy and has a direct and indirect impact on many Union citizens. It is estimated that sectors connected with the exploitation of maritime resources account for over 5% of EU GDP, not including income from tourism generated by exploiting the coasts.</p>
      <p sl="el">As such, I congratulate Mr Koumoutsakos on the work he has done, which supplements the Commission proposal by offering a comprehensive and balanced proposal for a regulation. I also consider the proposal made by Ms Patrão Neves to be very successful. I also sympathise with the general policy put forward by Commissioner Damanaki, which is fundamental and will, I believe, bring about better things for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">I also believe that the rapporteur has put forward some essential proposals in connection with island and outermost regions and that, if we are to achieve sustainable growth in coastal regions and islands, we need to pay particular attention to links between islands and the mainland. However, what we need is to look at the development of the maritime economy and coastal regions and the preservation of maritime ecosystems as a single entity.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I wholly agree with what my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, said on the importance of fishing to remote regions. Sometimes, fishing is all that exists, in terms of industry, employment and so on. I welcome this report since it is bringing certain aspects of the industry together.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The big breakthrough, President, in terms of fishery policy was the Green Paper for an integrated maritime policy published on 7 June 2006, because up until then, what we had were sectoral interests: fishing on the one hand, as against environmental considerations on the other. We have to recognise that what we need is a coherent approach; an integrated approach. What we need, on the one hand, is to see that fisheries are in remote areas very often the only sustainable economic activity while, on the other hand, we have to preserve them. That is why I particularly welcome this report and I congratulate the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Fisheries and aquaculture have their specific requirements and characteristics in terms of use of the maritime environment and the preservation of the conditions for the recovery and growth of fish stocks. This necessitates research, which is what this is all about: coming up with research, coming up with data, coming up with specifics so we can underpin fishery policy for the future.</p>
      <p sl="ga">From the point of view of the EU, the EU is a world power in fisheries and is the biggest market in the world as regards processed products using fish as a raw material. What we need to do is to ensure the sustainability and profitability of fishing – which is, after all, humanity’s oldest maritime activity. As a product of high nutritional value, fish is today – as always – a fundamental component of the European diet. Particularly at a time when we are talking about food sustainability and the availability of food, let us move forward. I think today is a very good day, so well done Commissioner, well done rapporteur, and thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Koumoutsakos, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the Commission’s proposal for a programme to support the further development of an integrated maritime policy is one way to achieve the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and to increase coherence between the various policy areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a welcome development that solutions have been sought on a cross-departmental basis in maritime policy and that an attempt has also been made to create synergies. Maritime policy goes beyond marine transport and fishing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Industry, research and alternative power generation, as well as environmental protection, are areas that are inseparably associated with the classic aspects of maritime policy. For this reason, there is a need for improved coordination between policy areas and between Member States with access to the sea.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report has improved on the Commission’s proposal on several counts. In this context, I expressly welcome the fact that more attention has been paid to environmental protection, the protection of species and the sustainable use of maritime resources, an aspect which, I must say, could have been given even more prominence in the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Koumoutsakos, I hope that you receive a broad negotiating mandate for your report and would also like to thank Mr Milana for his work and wish you all the best for the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have been able to meet up again. I stood here one year ago in my capacity as rapporteur on the further development of an integrated maritime policy. We have now reached a position where we can actually anchor a fixed maritime policy in European policy making and where we will have the appropriate financial framework. This is the major advantage gained from Mr Koumoutsakos’s follow-up report.</p>
      <p sl="de">For me, integrated maritime policy is not just what you might call a truly major concern, but also an enormously important future task for the European Union. It has already been pointed out that more of the earth is covered by water than land: the ratio is about 30% land to 70% water. There is a great deal of added value to be gained from water. This includes marine transport – 95% of all transport involves the sea – as well as, of course, fishing, research or offshore energy sources. We have a very broad range of options open to us when it comes to using the sea as a resource. We have just one earth and one mass of water, which is why we need to husband it as prudently as possible. This is a major challenge that we face. In practical terms, 40% of the EU’s gross domestic product comes from the IMP, the integrated maritime policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I have already said, our major success this time round is that the IMP now has a fixed basis. Although we have not achieved the hoped for EUR 50 million, a figure I believed to be a certainty last year, we have received EUR 40 million, most of which will be spent on cross-border projects. After all, it is important that cooperation should be practised that embraces various countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally I must express my sincere thanks to Mr Koumoutsakos. We made a good team when negotiating in the trialogue, which has now closed. We achieved an awful lot because we stuck together so well. Thank you again. I wish us both well with the integrated maritime policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, sea transport is a vital element of European transport and the European economy. A great many jobs and a great deal of innovation has come from the maritime cluster. Europe is therefore right to be investing in strengthening this sector at this time. I always see this as a win-win situation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">EUR 40 million has now been made available for the stimulus fund for the integrated maritime policy. Madam President, I would like to also see some of that money spent on education for young people who are considering working in sea transport so that they are aware of the opportunities in sea transport and the relationship between sea transport and ecology. I hope that that is possible. I personally would also like to see support for green shipping technology from this fund. In any case, there should be no money spent on consultants or all kinds of committees or who knows what to sit around discussing strategies. That never leads to much by way of results. Above all then, let us not go down that route.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Koumoutsakos. We enjoyed excellent cooperation and you managed to produce a good report out of complex material. You have my sincere thanks.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, the integrated maritime policy (IMP) advocates a coordinated approach to the management and governance of the oceans, seas and coasts as part of a comprehensive and consistent perspective for all EU policies with a maritime dimension. Having a comprehensive, integrated perspective involves the interaction of all Union policies with a maritime dimension, and better governance through greater involvement in the EU decision-making process is required.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The success and relevance of this policy has been demonstrated in recent years through various funded initiatives, in the shape of preparatory actions and pilot projects. The IMP should, for this very reason, continue to benefit from adequate funding over the next few years of the current financial programming period.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In view of this, I advocate adequate funding until 2013 – not just in order to consolidate past projects – and I support the establishment of a stable framework on the objectives of this programme.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For obvious reasons, issues of maritime policy, governance, sustainability and security concern some regions of the European Union – such as the outermost regions – more than others. Given that, with the exception of French Guiana, the outermost regions are islands and small in size, they rely on a small number of economic activities; sea- and fishing-related activities are of particular importance in these regions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Furthermore, it is thanks to the outermost regions that the European Union has the largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world. These make up more than half of the European Union’s EEZ – around 15 to 25 million km2 – and, together with the coastal regions, are fundamental to the economic growth of the European Union and its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A programme such as the IMP should benefit these regions by encouraging transnational coordination of maritime policies and significant international cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore necessary to ensure sufficient and continued funding, not just for the next two years, but also, and more importantly, for the next multiannual financial framework, which starts in 2014.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Commissioner, ‘An integrated maritime policy for the European Union’, known as the ‘Blue Book’, was adopted in October 2007. The European Union’s integrated maritime policy ensures greater coherence between the measures adopted as part of the various policies which have an impact on maritime and coastal areas and the need to use these ecosystems’ resources in a manner that does not affect the environment. EUR 50 million is being allocated for the 2011-2013 period for implementing the programme to support the continuing development of the integrated maritime policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States and the European Union must support training, education and career opportunities in maritime professions, such as vocational training for those responsible for ships and shipping. I should emphasise the importance of research, development and the promotion of green technologies, marine renewable energy sources and shipping. As a result of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the European Union is becoming a major player in the Black Sea region, which is of particular geostrategic significance for energy security and diversification of the European Union’s energy supply routes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call on the states bordering the Black Sea to sign a memorandum of understanding, with the aim of developing Black Sea maritime corridors, and we urge the Commission to open a TEN-T budget line which will fund the Black Sea maritime corridors, similar to the one used to fund the maritime corridors of the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Mediterranean. At the same time, we call on the Commission to develop a European Union strategy for the Black Sea similar to that for the Baltic Sea.</p>

      <p sl="es">The Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Fisheries have worked jointly, in accordance with Article 50. This has improved the initial document and made it more coherent, and it has lived up to its title as it is a comprehensive document on maritime policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">The programme has an overall aim: to make decisions in relation to seas, coastal, island and outermost regions, and to the various maritime sectors, in a coordinated, coherent, transparent and sustainable way. It also has specific development objectives: to foster integrated maritime governance and develop instruments for sharing information in order to improve maritime surveillance and protection of the environment, among others, with funding that we hope to see continue and increase from 2014.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of this aims to bring about economic growth, social cohesion and sustainable development, with an international dimension, but with a guarantee, since the Council will have to present its impact on EU policies by December 2012, that the results of our decisions will be assessed.</p>

However, if we are to save our seas, fisheries and coastal communities, a new approach is needed. A new approach requires creativity and innovation, and innovation requires freedom and autonomy for individuals.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We therefore need to change parts of the support package that we have – in this case, for an integrated maritime policy, rural development and so on. We need to create loan funds so that innovators can borrow money on reasonable terms, which is something they cannot do under the current financing system.

      <p sl="es">The integrated maritime policy represents a joint vision of our seas or, even more, the protection of 70% of the planet. A balance between ecosystems, coastal populations and the sea as a means of communication is important, but neither should we forget new competitive forms of energy like wind farms or the harnessing of wave energy.</p>
      <p sl="es">The population of coastal areas is of major social importance, it exceeds 50%, and many people make their living from fishing. Fishing is a crucial element in this report in terms of balance and sustainability, it can safeguard the equilibrium of the ecosystem, and, of course, research plays a major part.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think the rapporteur has emphasised the importance of agreements with third countries, and Europe can contribute to maintaining the equilibrium of the ecosystem of those third countries through such agreements, so as to ensure the sustainability of our seas.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to highlight a problem which has still not been cleared up, relating to the future of the European integrated maritime policy. The Black Sea needs to be given its own place in this policy so as to be treated on an equal footing with the other sea basins. There should be a body for managing Black Sea fisheries, different to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. I think that the European Union must make every diplomatic effort possible to get the Black Sea states which are not part of the European Union to align as closely as possible with the principles of our common fisheries policy, as this is not only in the interests of the EU Member States bordering the Black Sea, but also in the interests of the EU as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Atlantic, as Europe’s western sea border, also has links with both North and South America, and with Africa. This gives it a strategic dimension for Europe, indispensable to the architecture of a maritime policy designed with the future in mind. It is with the future in mind that the IMP, besides promoting linkages between maritime activities, should give the utmost priority to unleashing the potential of all three Atlantic regions, on the basis of science and technology.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Analysis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, of the deep sea and of the seabed represents a new frontier with untapped potential in biotechnology and in mineral resources, and is of inestimable value for the knowledge economy. The Union should therefore take advantage of the privileged location of the Azores, and of the great skill of the Department of Oceanography and Fisheries of the University of the Azores, by setting up a deep-sea observatory there.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the nature and particularities of the marine environment, the enormous and increasing diversity of activities that take place there today, and the need to regulate these activities, resolving potential conflicts in a socially and environmentally sustainable way, make it advisable to set out an integrated maritime policy (IMP) for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Of course, the objectives, guiding principles and resources available for this policy will certainly have a part to play. We have serious reservations about and even disagreements with the way in which the IMP has been set out. It is often founded on a federalist approach to the IMP that does not respect the sovereignty and jurisdiction of each Member State with regard to their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones, as well as linking it to the EU’s foreign policy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A maritime policy that was, instead, based on cooperation among the Member States, that naturally acknowledged the cross-border nature of the sea, but, at the same time, respected the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Member States, that promoted synergies, that increased added value, and that encouraged the sustainable use and conservation of marine resources, could undoubtedly have a positive impact.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think this is a very good day for the Commission. I agree with everybody. All your remarks were very valuable, and I think that this proves that we are running a win-win situation here. Nevertheless, since we have only EUR 40 million for two years, we have to focus on our priorities for these two years. I would like to emphasise this. We are going to go for the best use of this limited funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we are going to try to avoid any duplications and overlaps. This is very important. We are not going to fund projects that are already funded by other services or agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we have to create linkages between different sectors. Many of you underlined the need for creating linkages and better cooperation with other agencies, such as the EMSA (European Maritime Safety Agency) for transport or environmental agencies or research centres – for example our cooperation with the research services in Galway in Ireland and in other areas is very important – so that we can multiply the value of our money through this cooperation procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also to work together with environmental services since the Marine Strategy Framework Directive has until now had no funding line for its implementation. We have now earmarked around 10% of our money for environmental policy and for implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say all this just to persuade you that we are taking a great step forward. To cut a long story short, we have exhausted the resources from our land; we are now turning to the sea and we have to be very cautious because there is a possibility of conflict there – a conflict of interests and various other conflicts. We have to be very cautious, or we are going to destroy the sea and the oceans, as we have done to a certain extent with our land. So we have to be very cautious.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also going to develop sea-basin strategies. We already have a sea-basin strategy for the Baltic. We are going to improve it. In two weeks, we are going to launch the procedure for an Atlantic strategy in Lisbon and then we have to address strategies for the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. We have already taken the initiatives for these two areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">What will be the area priorities? First, good governance; second, cross-sectoral rules – maritime surveillance, marine knowledge and maritime spatial planning; third, the environment; and fourth, blue growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Blue growth is the effort to give our coastal states the possibility to expand their growth and jobs strategies. This is what we are trying to do, but we also need to focus on some areas where we have not yet achieved good results. I have in mind maritime coastal tourism. We also have to explore the possibilities of sea bottom mapping and exploitation, as we have already mentioned. Then of course we have some blue ocean energy projects – not only wind energy, but energy from the sea. We are opening a consultation procedure and we very much welcome your involvement in this procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would to thank everybody, especially the rapporteur, Mr Koumoutsakos, and the shadow rapporteurs to the committees for their commitment here. I would like to say that we really need this. I hope that we will work together in the future in order to be sure about the next financial perspectives and appropriate funding of the maritime policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The maritime area is changing. There are numerous challenges in this area, starting with the need for shared use. In particular, this means developing fishery-related jobs, which must be an objective of the common fisheries policy; strengthening maritime freight; harnessing the extraordinary industrial potential of offshore wind parks; and developing tourism activities. There can be no policy without a budget; we therefore need to ensure that the integrated maritime policy has its place in the future multiannual financial framework. However, I would say that, if this policy is to be a success, it is vital to get the Member States well and truly on board. This policy requires cross-sectoral but also transnational cooperation. However, in the Channel, transnational cooperation is waning. After 10 years of cofinancing an emergency tow vessel with France, the UK Government has now decided, as part of its cutbacks, to privatise its coastguard service, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the lack of a shared vision. An integrated maritime policy at European level must therefore be based on a synergy between national maritime policies, a synergy enhanced by a European ambition, which is itself equipped with adequate financial resources.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Isabella Lövin, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on combating illegal fishing at the global level – the role of the EU [2010/2210(INI) ] - (A7-0362/2011).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at this very moment around the world, at least one out of every five fish that is eaten has been taken out of the sea illegally. Some of these fish perhaps is the result of fishing a little bit over the quota by basically legal operators that may stretch the rules – which of course is not acceptable – but a lot of that fish is also taken by large-scale operators that premeditate and organise their crimes in a very skilled manner, who deliberately hide between flags of convenience, hide behind shell companies registered in tax havens, operators that bribe and corrupt coastguards and customs officers, operators that steal fish from sensitive unprotected areas and put the billion-euro profit directly into their own pockets, organised crime that now operate with a minimal risk of detection and sanction all over the world, especially in developing countries’ waters and in the high seas in international waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is estimated that illegal fishing accounts for between 11 and 26 million tonnes of fish a year, making illegal fishing the world’s second largest fish producer in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU last year put in place its new IUU and control regulations and this was indeed a major step forward in the fight against IUU globally.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the main elements was the new catch certification document that now has to accompany all the fish that enters the EU. This is important, since over 60% of all fish that is consumed in the EU today is imported. Why is this the case? Because we have overfished our own waters, consciously and with large contributions from subsidies, and this has led to a 40% decrease of catches since 1995. So our increasing dependency on fish from the outside, and with the EU fleet itself fishing all over the planet, our own responsibility to see to it that this fish is not illegally or irresponsibly caught is very evident.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my report I point to some of the dangers to the world that overfishing, and illegal fishing in particular, poses. They are not small. It threatens food security in developing countries, but also for future generations. It is one of the major causes of loss of biodiversity on the planet today, and the emptying of the world’s oceans of its living creatures is also degrading marine ecosystems so the oceans to a lesser extent are capable of doing their job as carbon sinks absorbing CO2 .</p>
      <p sl="en">We, the EU, have signed up to a lot of international obligations to eradicate hunger, halt the loss of biodiversity and fight against climate change – and fighting against the very concrete threats to the ocean that international illegal fishing represents is one of the most evident steps that the EU can take to try to achieve all of these objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my report, I point to a number of concrete actions that the EU must take. We cannot wait for the UN to move, we have to take unilateral actions in order to form alliances with the world’s largest fish markets. We need global certification schemes. But documents are not enough. We need global databases of fish DNA, we need global electronic traceability systems and we need advanced police cooperation between states.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot forget that two thirds of the world’s oceans are beyond national jurisdiction, and that the control, management and conservation of these areas today is largely lacking. I am therefore very happy that the European Parliament states the need to enlarge the regional fisheries organisations, both extend their geographical extension but also their mandate. They have to become more of management and conservation authorities, and less of exploitation clubs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to express my thanks to all the shadows, of course, and a last comment is about the amendment about the introduction of a common European coastguard dealing with migrants, etc. I believe this is an issue far too politically sensitive to be included in my report, and therefore I recommend deleting those words from paragraphs 12 and 13.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I very much welcome the report on combating illegal fishing at the global level, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Isabella Lövin, on the excellent way in which she brought together different opinions into a report. I know this is a controversial issue. I would like to congratulate her because her report deals with all the relevant issues. I would also like to thank all Members of the Committee on Fisheries for their outstanding work on this report, and of course Members from other relevant committees.</p>
      <p sl="en">In general, I fully agree with Ms Lövin’s analysis. Illegal fishing is a global problem and a very difficult problem to handle since a lot of countries are involved in each operation. This is the great problem about illegal fisheries. You could have a Greek vessel, a French captain, a Korean crew, and they go to the Canaries to land what they have caught, so it is very difficult to tackle the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why – after the implementation of the IUU Regulation – we are trying to have a consistent stance inside the European Union and outside the European Union. This is a very important parameter if we want to fight illegal fishing. We have to behave the same way inside and outside EU waters, otherwise we cannot be reliable.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think two issues are very important here: better governance and transparency. We must also solve the problem of subsidies. We need to increase cooperation among market States, develop new tools at international level, and pursue the development of a global catch documentation system.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to highlight two issues; firstly on cooperation among market States, I have already taken the first step. We have signed the Joint Statement with the United States pledging bilateral cooperation to combat illegal fisheries. But we have to implement this agreement and we also have to have further cooperation and sign similar agreements with other very important countries. Here we are planning to work with Japan, Canada and other countries – including China of course – because if we really want to combat illegal fishing worldwide we have to cooperate with everybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I want to highlight the issue of subsidies where we have shared views. The Regulation provides that subsidies can no longer be granted to operators involved directly or indirectly in illegal fishing. My services will now look closely into allegations relating to incidents that happened after the rules entered into force. For the previous period we cannot do much, but after the entry into force of this Regulation we can do something, and that is what we are trying to do now.</p>
      <p sl="en">To make our framework even stronger, I plan to introduce two specific elements in the future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. First, conditionality. No subsidy can be granted to operators involved in illegal fishing. This will be a rule: absolute conditionality. Second, financial correction. Subsidies granted to such operators will be withdrawn. We need these clear rules to fill the existing gaps.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also subscribe to Ms Lövin’s views that illegal fishing activities by their very nature are in fact criminal activities. Countries need to cooperate with each other in investigations, proceedings, and ultimately prosecutions if we want to actively combat these ‘pirate’ actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a final point, the EU as the biggest player in this market has a moral obligation to take the lead in this fight. I am looking forward to continue working with Parliament and all stakeholders in order to best shape our role. I would like to emphasise that we are doing our best, but you need to bear in mind that we have just started. We have limited resources and we cannot be everywhere in the world, but we are going to use taxpayers’ money in the best way in order to have concrete results.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Lövin, on her excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I am pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has taken up the points contained in our opinion, because it is vital for the development dimension to be taken into account in the measures to combat illegal fishing at the global level, for the sake of policy coherence and the close links with development policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, combating illegal fishing requires global solutions and the involvement of all countries, including developing ones. However, countries’ technical and financial capabilities also need to be taken into account in the actions to be undertaken. The same constraints cannot be imposed on developed and developing countries without support measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Small island states have very limited capabilities, for example. Therefore, they must be supported in their efforts to combat illegal fishing. That is why the Union will have to increase the budget for the fisheries sector when it signs agreements in this area in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, it is vital to ensure that the measures to combat illegal fishing are actually applied, because this practice harms the development of countries insofar as it reduces the financial resources they could earn from fishing as an economic activity. The fact is, developing countries need those resources to implement social, economic and education policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, it is important for the European Union, when implementing these measures to combat illegal fishing in developing countries, to encourage the involvement of civil society and businesses alongside the countries receiving aid. A holistic approach needs to be taken to halt the scourge of illegal fishing.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is very widespread at a global level and, as a result, it is impossible to make an accurate estimate of how many tonnes of fish are caught illegally every day.</p>
      <p sl="it">As already acknowledged by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 2001 with the adoption of a plan of action to combat illegal fishing, the battle against this problem is a declared priority of the international community. IUU fishing causes serious environmental, economic and social damage and, as also shown by the United Nations report on drugs and crime, is often carried out by actual criminal organisations committing crimes such as tax evasion, customs fraud, money laundering, corruption and handling stolen goods.</p>
      <p sl="it">The IUU and Control Regulations provide the EU with powerful tools to combat IUU fishing by defining the obligations and opportunities of both Member States and third countries. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure global cooperation by all countries, not just European Member States. In order to achieve this, the EU must itself be above reproach, and must not hesitate to take all necessary action, even against Member States themselves, to combat this illegal activity.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it is useful to continue, in fact to improve the various surveillance programmes in developing countries. All the measures leading to closer cooperation on a legislative and operational level in the various regional fishing organisations that have been clearly identified in the report by Ms Lövin, to whom I offer my compliments, should be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that it is crucial for the EU to undertake the necessary action on a multilateral and global level because, as everyone is well aware, this is not a problem that the EU can resolve on its own.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteur, Ms Lövin, for her work on this report and for her cooperation. It is about time that we combated illegal fishing at the global level. It should not be possible to land illegally caught fish in any port in the world. Clearly, we have to take a look at ourselves in Europe, too, to ensure that we have our own house in order. If there are no ports where someone can land and sell the fish, the incentive for illegal fishing will also be removed.</p>
      <p sl="da">In my view, illegal fishing is something despicable, and serious infringements should be punished on a par with economic offences. After all, illegal fishing is detrimental to everything and everyone. It is detrimental to fish stocks and it makes it difficult to assess their sustainability. It is detrimental to the ecosystem in the world’s oceans because we do not know how many fish are being caught. Lastly, of course, it is also detrimental to those fishermen who behave decently and stay within the realms of the law. With this report, we now have a good basis for tightening up the rules, which is something that has been lacking in the fight against illegal fishing. Illegal fishing must be stopped. It is one of the biggest threats to sustainable fishing in the future.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I should also like to begin by expressing my thanks and congratulations for the magnificent work of Ms Lövin in this most important area of combating illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is one of the worst threats, not only to biodiversity, but also to those parts of the sector which depend specifically on healthy resources and which want to do things in the right way.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, in order to do this, we need greater coherence. It is unacceptable that, as we have been told, ships and companies that have been fishing illegally are in receipt of public, institutional funding from the European Union or from Member States, as is happening in Spain in the case of Vidal Armadores. This is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, we need measures to ensure more investigation, more monitoring capability, and, above all, deterrent and exemplary penalties. We have an excellent opportunity to do this through the reform of Community fishing policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason, I welcome not only the report but also the Commission’s statements, and I hope that we will take this opportunity which, unfortunately, we have neglected to take in the past.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank Isabella Lövin for the excellent preparation of the report on combating illegal fishing. Given the state of resources in seas and oceans, this is a report of key importance for the future common fisheries policy. Of unprecedented importance is the need to ensure that the standards binding within the European Union come into force the world over. The EU is the biggest importer of fish products, which gives us the right to introduce requirements and rules for eliminating illegal fishing. The common fisheries policy contains extremely demanding stipulations as regards the European fisheries. Illegal fishing constitutes the darkest element of the unfair competition that depletes our environment and destroys European fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When approving the report, it is also worth remembering that we should enforce it by joint efforts, not just within the European Commission, but also in all parliamentary committees. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, as the rapporteur rightly says, fishing is a global activity, so illegal fishing necessarily is too. Illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing has a significant negative impact on part of humankind’s common heritage: the oceans and their immense, but finite, resources. It is estimated that it accounts for at least 15% of total catches, although it could very well account for much more.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The conservation of this heritage can only be a common task and responsibility of humankind. The combating of illegal fishing must therefore be considered a priority in the context of international cooperation within the framework of multilateral organisations like the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations (UN).</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, are of particular importance. It is also important to step up the role of regional fisheries management organisations in international cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We should like to acknowledge and show our appreciation for the rapporteur’s efforts to encourage a broad debate, which includes various interim reports, and to draft a comprehensive and thorough report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We should also like to acknowledge her willingness to take on board all relevant suggestions. Despite some naturally conflicting views, the consensus that has been reached will reflect not just the nature of the topic but also the working method followed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regrettably, the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), concerning the creation of a European coastguard, are threatening this consensus. These amendments clearly distort the scope of the report and the debate held whilst it was being prepared. Unlike most of the others in the report, these amendments – some of which are innovative – are far from consensual.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore call for these amendments to be rejected: otherwise, in our opinion, the report will be substantially weakened.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the CFP was only introduced in 1973, when the UK joined the common market. Up to then, UK fishermen had looked after their fisheries so well, without all these regulations, that other profligate Member States wanted a slice of our action. The result? Illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any system of complex rules and regulations produces cheats – that is human nature. Now you want to duplicate our coastguard and to consider more rules to combat possible illegal recreational fishing. Does the EU never stop meddling? To preserve fish stocks, Member States must be responsible for their own fishing waters up to the 200-mile limit or the median line. Bilateral arrangements would be up to them and they would have to protect their own fish stocks in their own interests, under their laws and their enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Norway does just that. Stocks have recovered, especially the spawning stocks of several species – but then Norway is not in the EU and does not have to obey its crazy rules. It bans discards, requiring that all fish caught be landed. Meanwhile, EU stocks are seriously depleted. I know thought is being given to discards, but after 38 years of waste, will our stocks recover?</p>
      <p sl="en">As to combating illegal fishing globally, the EU’s discard policy is the greatest illegal fishing scandal of all! That – and licensing European fleets to raid the waters of the third world, reducing those people to poverty – is what I call illegal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Ms Lövin, for the report and to assure her of my support for it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, I presented the Commission with details of an innovative project being launched by marine scientists in Northern Ireland, who are about to begin work on an ecosystem approach to management within the Irish Sea. That process is far from simple. However, in the meantime, annual decisions will soon be made that will have far-reaching consequences for our fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has proposed significant cuts in a range of fishing opportunities for 2012, on the basis that the stocks concerned are ‘data poor’. We are told that the failed long-term cod recovery plan has to stay in place for at least another year, either because of a lack of resources to fix it or because the Treaty denies us the flexibility to do so. The development of an integrated maritime policy is sensible but will take time, and in the meantime we risk ignoring the problems that are impacting upon my constituents and our seas today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the question of combating illegal fishing on a global level, I will again highlight a problem on the EU’s doorstep; namely the illegal catches of mackerel by Iceland and the Faroe Islands, as well as further dramatic autonomous increases in their catches during 2011. The Faroe Islands have issued mackerel licences to a number of third-country vessels, some of which are blacklisted by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. A solution must be found – but not one that rewards Iceland and the Faroes with a further substantial share of that stock.</p>

      <p sl="es">This report gives the European Union a wider role in relation to illegal fishing. Europe can now take on a global leadership role. Previous regulation has apparently proved insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">This regulation will give us more guarantees as there will be the same kind of inspection in all Member States, the same checking of information and the same penalties. This presupposes that we will be able to identify the offender, as we do not want to punish the sector, Mr Romeva i Rueva, only the offender.</p>
      <p sl="es">There will also be a very important external factor, namely, introducing conditions for fish imports from third countries in the form of supporting documents from the authorities in these countries. The agreements will play a crucial role in closing our doors to fleets which do not meet these conditions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my Green Group colleague, Ms Lövin, has contributed her expertise and commitment to this report and that is one of the reasons why – unusually for a Fisheries Committee report – it is being greeted with unanimity across this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report says that the EU, at least on paper, has armed itself with tools to combat illegal fishing, but we have to do more than that to persuade other regimes and other states. We have to be above reproach, and it further calls on the review of the common fisheries policy (CFP) to be used to create incentives for legal fishing. This is very important. Incentives are absolutely crucial to successful fisheries management policy, and the current CFP has singularly failed to provide them.</p>
      <p sl="en">By contrast, the conservation credit scheme that is operating in Scotland has government, industry and environmental NGOs all working together to devise and implement successful management measures which, among other things, are radically reducing the wastage of discards. In my view, a CFP which threatens equal access to waters and resources will not help to encourage such initiatives, nor will it provide the necessary incentives to report illegal activity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to say that the European Union is the world’s biggest maritime power largely as a result of its outermost regions. They are a major asset for Europe, and so the development and implementation of a comprehensive policy on the seas, oceans and seabed are essential for the future. However, I fear that EUR 20 million or EUR 50 million will not be enough to meet this great challenge. The fight against illegal fishing is part of this major policy, and there is an urgent need, at EU level, to find an appropriate solution to this problem, particularly in the context of international cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also point out that the maritime areas of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion are regularly raped and pillaged.

      <p sl="es">The aims of a common policy on sustainable fishing, protection of the marine environment and promotion of fishing without unfair competition will not be accomplished if we do not take a committed stand in the fight against such illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">The oceans know no boundaries, so efforts must be made at both European and international level. The European Union needs to have credible policies here and should impose penalties on practices like those recently publicised where Community-flagged vessels operate illegally in waters protected by conservation measures.</p>
      <p sl="es">The problem of illegal fishing does not only concern third-country vessels but also EU-flagged operators. Furthermore, we cannot make progress in the absence of powerful financial instruments which will make access to public money conditional on carrying out effective monitoring procedures and complying with all fishing regulations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Commissioner, there is only one real issue, and that is that the Commission needs to have a global role.

The relationship with the United States, China and Japan is crucial in this sense, because the essence of this activity lies within this relationship, within the construction of common rules and the resulting behaviours.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise as MEP for East Anglia to protest that the objectives discussed in the earlier debate on integrated maritime policy, as well as those in paragraph 12 of this report on combating illegal fishing, are fatally undermined by the UK closure of coastguard stations, including both Walton and Great Yarmouth in my constituency.</p>
      <p sl="en">By definition, the sailing community travels between the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands and thus relies on adequate coastguard services on both sides of the Channel and the North Sea. From an East Anglian perspective – given the need to serve the busy shipping routes to the ports of Yarmouth, Harwich, Felixstowe and Tilbury, as well as the economic importance of seaside tourism and the mass development of offshore wind farms – this is a disaster waiting to happen on a level with the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
      <p sl="en">Britain has already withdrawn four rescue and fire-fighting tugs from the Channel and has put the responsibility on France; a step which, according to my colleague Ms Grelier, is causing widespread anger in Northern France.</p>
      <p sl="en">I call on the Commission to investigate whether the British closure of coastguard stations breaches the principles of EU maritime policy and our country’s obligations to protect European marine protection sites in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex; and I call on the British Government to think again, or it will have lost lives on its conscience.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have just been discussing the integrated maritime policy and, of course, fishing also plays a role there. Since I have been dealing with this topic for some time, I am aware that fishing is usually the last policy to be decided. Fishermen naturally play an important role in our food supply, however. It is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises that they should be able to work in a secure area and that illegal fishing should be prevented as it makes their work and their position in the marketplace more difficult.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we have heard is quite true: this issue does not just affect cooperation with developing countries. It goes without saying that this is significant because these countries also import fish. It is also important for us, however, because we need to prevent illegal fishing. For this reason, I should like to pick up on one of the points Mr Milana and Ms Lövin raised. I know that not everyone equally favours the European coastguard service. However, I do believe that we need better cooperation on this front in Europe at least. This was already called for in a Parliamentary report on integrated maritime policy dating from 2008. I have brought this up repeatedly and the Commission also needs to table a proposal in this area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, given the technological advances and the investment required in the European Union’s space policy, I should stress the important role which the use of satellite navigation systems plays in monitoring, controlling and carrying out surveillance on fishing activities. Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, which extended the scope of the common fisheries policy to the Black Sea. Unfortunately, there is no global agreement on the regional management of the Black Sea fish stocks, apart from bilateral agreements.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission’s support is needed to develop regional dialogue aimed at devising a common marine strategy in the Black Sea region, also involving the other states bordering the Black Sea. I think that setting up a Black Sea consultative forum is appropriate. This will provide a technical form of communication and cooperation for the operators in the fisheries sector. If a basic sharing agreement continues to remain in abeyance, there is a risk of the resources collapsing, and the economic damage already caused to certain fisheries resources will become widespread.</p>

The Commission will decide by the end of 2012 whether recreational fishing can be regarded as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Recreational anglers catch a minuscule percentage of the total catch but, most important of all, recreational anglers are much more likely to return immature fish safely to the sea.</p>

At this point, I would like to take the unusual step of praising the Council of Ministers, which succeeded in agreeing an IUU regulation before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, in other words, without our cooperation. That was an important step forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, Ms Lövin’s excellent report makes it clear that there is still a lot of work to do. Illegal fishing is a typical example of problems that are so big that the European Union cannot deal with them on its own. We need global solutions. The fact is that global solutions require effective global institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the rapporteur on reform of the common fisheries policy, I would like to close with the following remark: the best protection against illegal fishing is afforded by fishermen who know the rules and who are convinced that these make sense. This must be our guiding principle in pursuing new reforms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is difficult to estimate the extent of IUU fishing. It has a direct economic impact on countries, especially developing countries, and these countries are losing the value of the catches that could be taken by local fishermen if IUU fishing was not taking place. This fishing is facilitated by a lack of access to information about vessel names and the identity of their owners. We must ensure Member States fully enforce rules obliging ships to carry this information.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of equal concern is the role of organised crime in IUU fishing. Criminal organisations have been dipping their feet into the world of this criminal activity, and they have a strong economic incentive. Many species of fish, particularly those that have been over-exploited, are in short supply and are therefore of high value. Some of the more traditional criminal techniques are now being put to use to support IUU fishing; techniques such as human trafficking, slave labour, tax evasion, money laundering, customs fraud, corruption and handling of stolen goods, etc.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers. Let me start by giving you some clarification on recreational fisheries. Recreational fisheries is not, I repeat not, an EU competence. So the European Commission is not responsible, and the national governments have to tackle all these problems. So please, do not come back again and again here to recreational fisheries. The Commission’s only responsibility is to ensure, when we are talking about recreational fisheries, that the product cannot be sold. Everything else comes under the competence of national governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to our main point. This report was broadly supported and deserves it, because it is a good report, is well-balanced and also refers to all the relevant issues. However, I would like to answer some of your remarks and would mainly like to raise two points. I would like to try to convince you that we are improving, and I would like to convey to you this positive message.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have done a lot since this IUU regulation was put in force. We have achieved much and sometimes we have solved some problems. That has to be recognised. For example, you have mentioned our obligation to be responsible in our waters. Well, we have been responsible. The Commission is doing its job. I should mention the last case of the use of drift nets in the Mediterranean. The national governments have been pushed and been obliged to take all the necessary measures, and we are going further on this case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, Mr Romeva i Rueda referred to a Spanish enterprise. Well, I can tell you that we have had some news today: the owner of that enterprise himself was sanctioned by a court in Las Palmas, and now he is facing a prison sentence because of fishing illegally in the Antarctic. So we are improving here, and not only on paper as somebody said.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding international cooperation, we have done much in the last year. Let me just give you some figures. To date, the Commission has finalised ten evaluation missions to Panama, Belize, Sri Lanka, Mauritania, Thailand, China, Guinea-Conakry, Senegal, Korea and Indonesia. So we have done a lot of work. Referring to other countries and our cooperation, I would like also to mention that since July 2011 we have gone through 120 procedures of requests to flag states because their vessels have fished illegally. Up to now, the flag states concerned have put sanctions on 19 vessels. We are talking about Belize, China – 13 vessels were punished by the Chinese authorities themselves – the Comoros, Guinea and others. We are doing a lot, bearing in mind our limited resources, but I do agree that we have to do more and I really rely on you in order to take that exercise further.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to say a few words on the European coastguard, which was raised a couple of times. I am very much in favour of more cooperation between different coastguards, and we also have the Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo, which I think should be reinforced in their work so that is out of the question, but I think that the European coastguard is going too far in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am extremely proud that this Parliament would endorse the notions that also are included in this report: the creation of a global body to fill the void that is actually right now very, very evident in this world and that is the governance of our world’s oceans and the international waters, and that we support the creation of a body, possibly under the auspices of the UN, and that the RFMOs should go from being exploitation clubs to actually management bodies of the world’s oceans. That is also something that I am very glad that this Parliament supports.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, this report also calls for the international oceans governance to be made a priority at the next world summit on sustainable development in Rio – the Rio+20 next year. As Ms Rohde said, we need global solutions and I think we need global institutions, perhaps, to tackle this problem and, given the challenges of a shrinking planet, we need to think boldly and very urgently as well.

      <p sl="pt">Protection against illegal, undeclared and unregulated (IUU) fishing is also crucial for the sustainability of resources and the activities of fishing communities in the Azores. The region in which we live possesses the largest exclusive economic zone in Europe. However, in the absence of continental shelves, this vast area has a lot of very deep water but few fish. The balanced exploitation of these fragile ecosystems is crucial if their deterioration is to be prevented. However, preventing IUU fishing in this area is difficult, because of the vastness of our waters, and of the insufficient and inappropriate methods that Portugal has been using to control the amount of fishing in our waters. It is therefore necessary that the European Union intervene and that priority be given to adequate surveillance and to control methods capable of counteracting this threat and monitoring and controlling the illegal activities that are squandering our resources, thus endangering them and threatening the survival of our fishing communities.</p>

Since almost two-thirds of the oceans do not come under the exclusive jurisdiction of one country but are classed as international waters, it will require concerted international action and international legislation if we are to curb illegal fishing. At the same time, however, there is an increasing need for protein from the sea to feed the world’s growing population. For this reason, at the same time as combating illegal fishing, we need to develop and support freshwater aquaculture as the most sustainable form of fishing.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Overfishing poses a serious threat to biodiversity and sustainable marine environments. The situation is made more acute by illegal fishing, which further exacerbates the social and economic impacts of depleted fish stocks. Finally, the potential risks to food security continue to grow due to the fact that, for more than a billion inhabitants of planet Earth, fish and other seafood are the primary source of protein. The problem of illegal fishing is not that the means do not exist for surveillance or for securing evidence where the rules are broken. The problem is that everyone is always blaming something, and meanwhile half a million tonnes of illegally caught fish worth over a billion euro is imported into the EU every year. Lack of political will is harming both European fishermen and fish stocks. Tests of origin using the worldwide DNA database now cost about EUR 8 per sample, and large numbers do not have to be carried out: it is enough to carry out random testing. And if we can pay anyone to take satellite photographs of, or eavesdrop on, anyone anywhere on the globe, we can also occasionally use this technology for something sensible. Even here, the costs are not staggering in comparison with the losses caused by illegal fishing. It is therefore essential to examine the adequacy of the control mechanisms and their use in practice.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report introduced by Ms Lövin illustrates the grievous nature of the problem related to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). To drive the message home, it is sufficient to compare the value of 6.4 million tonnes of fish caught by the countries within the European Union in the course of a year with what is – I would stress that – a lower estimate of the volume of illegal fishing, with an annual value of 11 million tonnes, which is nearly twice the total annual catch within the entire European Union. In my opinion, the EU countries should not just combat IUU fishing but also take some practical steps towards preventing it. Among other things, legislation should be harmonised to such a level as to enable effective operation of the executive bodies in combating IUU fishing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nearly half of the EU residents are linked, directly or indirectly, economically or socially, with fisheries in a broader sense, which is why improving the situation in this industry would be a substantial catalyst for economic growth. An important aspect of providing support to fisheries is cooperation with countries outside the EU. A strong position enjoyed by the EU in the sphere of fisheries notwithstanding, I believe that cooperating with such countries as Japan, China or the United States is of great importance for the efficient introduction of regulations. The IUU phenomenon has no frontiers and should be kept in check, and then eliminated in accordance with the subject of the above report, that is, through international cooperation at the global level.</p>

In the current legislative term, this is the declaration that has obtained the most signatures. It is a record for this sitting. Many thanks. The declaration was the initiative of my colleague, Mr Marinescu, who had been approached by the Romanian National Association for the Deaf. In other words, the initiative came from them, and the approach taken by Mr Marinescu was exemplary: he contacted me as a person affected. This is what the principle ‘nothing about us without us’ is all about. I hope that this written declaration will put greater pressure on the European institutions to take more effective action to ensure that barriers to emergency assistance are eliminated. We have the technology. It is available; we just need to use it. In this case I, as a deaf person, will not only be able to call for help for myself; I will be able to call for help for you. This is another reason why I would like to thank you for supporting this initiative. In the gallery, there are deaf people who have lobbied on this issue and I think they deserve a big round of applause, but using sign language, not hand-clapping.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is the first permanent international judicial body capable of trying individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Over the years, the ICC has made a major contribution to the creation of a high-level system for the protection of fundamental human rights, intervening in cases where highly damaging crimes, in terms of both the crime and the number of victims, have gone unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, the ICC currently finds itself at a critical juncture, for political and financial reasons. This is why Parliament has spoken today in order to emphasise strongly the need for complete and immediate cooperation between the Member States, and not just some of them. Each Member State must be ready to make its contribution to the judicial body. Only this way, I believe, will it be possible to make the fight against impunity for these terrible crimes more effective.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the past 20 years have witnessed a juridical revolution. It has been carried out stealthily in plush conference venues, out from under the private eye, but it is a revolution. It has shifted power permanently and substantively away from elected national representatives to a global corpus of lawyers and human rights activists.</p>
      <p sl="en">The tried and clearly understood precept that we have had since the Treaty of Westphalia – the idea that every state is responsible for its domestic affairs and that crimes are the responsibility of the state on whose territory they were committed – has been cast aside not only for cross-border issues, but also for domestic questions: gender equality, the rights of minorities, labour laws and so on.</p>

I must point out that illegal fishing in the Black Sea is jeopardising high-value species which typically have a long lifecycle.

In cooperation also lies strength, and together we should also establish a transatlantic employment and growth initiative that incorporates a clear plan to promote trade and investment.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In addition to the economy, we also need to promote peace, stability and the development of open democracies. We need cooperation, especially in the Middle East, and we must support the emerging democracies in North Africa. We always have to avoid double standards in foreign and human rights policy.</p>

Our involvement in Northern Africa is essential for safeguarding the achievements resulting from democratic change. I am also placing my hopes in a proposal to stabilise the situation fraught with constantly increasing tension in connection with Iran’s nuclear programme, which requires urgent coordinated measures. I am also waiting for concrete solutions in the struggle against the debt crisis.

Democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law: these are worth adhering to.

Point 11, for example, in which the EU and the US are urged to push for a resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine in compliance with international law, is worthy of our support. I think, however, that we should not impose preconditions – as people are trying to here – regarding what form these talks should take and what limits should be set. Instead, the negotiators should be given the opportunity and the talks should be supported. In this respect, whenever peace talks are initiated, the basic approach should be that we show respect for the negotiators and support them, and not, as it were, dictate terms from Europe concerning how the talks should be managed and what outcomes there ought to be.</p>

      <p sl="en">The summit dialogue needs to ensure that US politicians and regulators respect the need for parity in our financial services legislation. We need to make sure that, in the attempt to make our financial markets more secure, we do not begin to limit access on the flow of capital. Likewise, the Dodd-Frank Act needs to be interpreted in a non-protectionist way. Extra-territoriality, equivalence and reciprocity are not essential, but recognition of comparable systems of regulation is, and we need to seek ways of acknowledging this. We must work to ensure the Dodd-Frank Act and the EU’s European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) fit together. Closer cooperation between the EU and the US on financial services needs to continue, but the spirit of equals to prevent extra-territoriality battles needs to endure.</p>

      <p sl="en">The US Constitution is 7 200 words long. The European, in the form of the Lisbon Treaty, is 78 000 words long. The US Constitution is concerned with broad principles, such as the balance between federal and state jurisdictions; the European equivalent busies itself with such minutiae as policy on space exploration and the status of refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">The American Declaration of Independence holds out the promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

The one is about the freedom of the individual, the other about the power of the state.</p>

They are essential if we are to do anything about fighting global regulatory arbitrage. We are each other’s biggest investors, and if we use the OECD study of May 2005 as a basis for lifting the non-tariff barriers that Mr Kamall talked about, and apply best regulatory practices, we could see our economies grow by as much as 3-6% GNI year on year. That is still something very much worth going for – a growth agenda not just on the supply side, but that also has to look at jobs and how to create them. We forget this at our peril.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Bruce Stokes paper recently produced on growth and jobs also helps to promote this philosophy of backing industry not just on competitiveness but also, vitally, on attracting investment. Governments at EU level and the Commission, along with the US, need not just to manage debt reduction but also investment policy and incentives to job creation. This should not be done artificially but with the support of, and in line with, commercial and scientific research and development, specifically in the SME market.

This is where I start to feel pulled in two directions, as the one should not preclude the other. In relation to value added tax and sales tax in particular, we have the special principle of reduced tax rates, which is interpreted in different ways within the European Union. Several problems arise in relation to the issue of digital trading in written material, such as electronic books, for example, the fact that the reduced tax rate is applied in one country but not in another.

According to the Commission’s own figures, the benefits of the single market are EUR 120 billion a year. So, according to the Commission – and it should know if anybody does – the single market is five times more expensive to business than the benefits it generates.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the way to reverse that balance is to scrap regulations and to cut tax, but one cannot cut tax as long as one harmonises it. Tax harmonisation will always be upwards for the most basic of reasons, which is that the main constraint fiscally on a government is external competition. One can raise tax rates up to a certain point, and then the money starts going abroad. But if one finds, through the EU, a mechanism to get around that by exporting one’s costs to one’s competitors then, of course, tax rates as a whole will rise and the continent as a whole will fall further and further behind in the world.</p>

The issuance of arrest warrants against Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, one of the sons of the former Libyan dictator, and the former head of the Libyan intelligence service, has borne fruit: both are due to be tried by the ICC and Libya.

It deals with a relatively new subject and with an international body tasked with carrying out a very delicate and important role. Therefore, it is only right that the EU should provide as much political and diplomatic support as possible in order to strengthen the ICC’s functioning and powers, as well as to extend its territorial jurisdiction. Another positive aspect is the European Parliament’s proposal for Member States to make every effort, through diplomatic routes in their bilateral and multilateral relations, to persuade major countries such as the United States, Russia and Turkey to adhere to the Statute of the International Criminal Court.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the universal nature of justice implies its even application, free of exceptions and double standards. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the first permanent international judicial body which is able to try individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, thus making a decisive contribution to the upholding of human rights and to international law by combating impunity, playing a crucial deterrent role and sending a clear signal that impunity for these crimes will not be tolerated. Moreover, nowhere should there be a safe haven for those who have committed genocide, crimes against humanity, extrajudicial executions, war crimes, torture, mass rape or forced disappearances. The European Parliament stresses the need for the ICC to expand its focus beyond situations of armed conflict and, more proactively, to investigate human rights emergencies that escalate to the level of crimes against humanity, as well as situations where domestic authorities are demonstrably unwilling to investigate, prosecute and punish alleged offenders. Despite the strong level of support provided by the EU and its Member States to the Court, much remains to be done on a political and diplomatic level, as well as a practical level, to help the Court overcome the challenges and difficulties it currently faces.</p>

      <p sl="ro">No one can deny the importance of such an international court which investigates serious cases involving breaches of human rights, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Consequently, it is important that an ever increasing number of states acknowledge the authority of the ICC. It has taken 83 years to reach an international agreement and set up the ICC. At the moment, states which have ratified the ICC’s Rome Statute must also regulate the Court’s right to investigate crimes of aggression.

      <p sl="el">It goes without saying that we condemn any criminal act committed against humanity. At the same time, however, we maintain that justice should be dispensed at national level and within the framework of the UN, and always on the basis of international law. Unfortunately, the way in which the ICC is organised and operates cannot safeguard political impartiality; on the contrary, it reinforces the risk of developing ‘justice’ which is pre-determined by those who dispense it. This motion for a resolution has no hesitation in calling for pressure to be exerted on the Member States to make a financial contribution to the ICC, to apply national legislation on cooperation with the ICC and to conclude framework agreements for the enforcement of the Court’s sentences. These proposals target the sovereign rights of the Member States; at the same time, they harbour the risk of marginalising both the UN and UN Security Council and the EU Council by promoting the concentration of authority in the ICC and the special representatives appointed by the High Representative. What is particularly worrying is the intention to give the ICC the right to intervene in the internal affairs of states based solely on certain ‘suspicions’ and to develop ‘preventive action’, which, of course, harbours the risk of promoting foreign interests.

In order to discourage crime, it is crucial that criminals be aware of how difficult it is to escape trial for atrocities they have committed. However, at a time when the ICC should be working full-time, it is suffering from a lack of financial support to sustain its activity. This report, drafted by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, concerns the European Union’s support for the ICC, particularly following the growing number of trials that need to be held in the countries of the southern Mediterranean, if the Arab Spring is to be a reality after thousands of people have given their lives for it. The ICC must extend its activities to all countries in which crimes against humanity take place. However, in order to achieve this, the European Union and its Member States – or rather, its supporting pillars – need to establish conditions for it to work, and to successfully motivate other countries, such as China and the United States, to fully adopt the legislation implementing the ICC.

I gave my support to this programme so that, with this regulation, the EU integrated maritime policy will have a specific line in the EU budget, one that will rise to EUR 40 million following the negotiations with the Council. Promoting the protection of the marine environment, in particular its biodiversity, while supporting sustainable ‘blue’ economic growth in terms of employment and technological development in all sectors of the maritime economy and in coastal, island and outermost regions: that is what we need to use this programme for.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Mr Koumoutsakos, concerns a proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme to support the further development of an integrated maritime policy (IMP). In 2007, the Commission, advocating an integrated approach to the management of the oceans, seas and coasts, tabled a Green Paper on the IMP and the communication ‘An integrated maritime policy for the European Union’, which formed the basis of European policy in this area. In the years that followed – from 2008 to 2010 – Parliament adopted some resolutions in this regard, and various initiatives were funded through preparatory actions and pilot projects. Despite the financial crisis, the European Union must continue to fund the IMP, as laid down in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Furthermore, the Member States must assemble synergies so as to share information and work together, while taking account of the sustainable use and protection of marine and coastal resources. For these reasons, I am voting for this report, which has resulted from Parliament’s support, on 21 October 2010, for the Commission’s intention to spend EUR 50 million on funding the IMP over the next two years.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As the integrated maritime policy (IMP) has been tabled by the Commission and supported by the majority in this House, it is marked by a federalist, mercantilist and geostrategic vision of how the exclusive economic zones of the Member States should be used. The report states that the strategic objectives of the IMP include integrated maritime governance at every level, and it is well known that we cannot agree with some of this policy’s objectives, from border control and the liberalisation of maritime transport to the security-related issues and the European coastguard. This report attempts to regulate a programme supporting the further development of the IMP, even though, at this stage, its content does not reflect the dangerous and negative aspects that we have pointed out. However, these aspects cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What is important at this stage is facilitating the funding of studies on aspects such as protecting and preserving the marine environment, or on supporting the outlining of policies concerning the sea or coastal areas, particularly in the areas of economic development, employment, environmental protection, research, maritime safety, energy and developing green maritime technologies.

Of course, the objectives, guiding principles and resources available for this policy will not be without impact. We have serious reservations about and disagreements with the way in which the EU’s integrated maritime policy (IMP) has been set out. A federalist approach is often taken to the IMP that does not respect the sovereignty and jurisdiction of each Member State with regard to the management of its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones, as well as linking it with the EU’s ‘foreign policy objectives’. A maritime policy that were, instead, based on cooperation among the Member States, respecting their sovereignty and jurisdiction, that promoted synergies, that increased added value, and that encouraged the sustainable use and conservation of marine resources, could undoubtedly have a positive impact.</p>

They are European trade routes, climatic regulators, sources of food, energy and resources and are favourite places for living and recreation. Our technology and knowledge allow us to derive even more capital from the sea, with growing numbers of people visiting the European coastal areas to benefit from this capital, but, at the same time, the cumulative effect of these activities has led to imbalances in the use of the marine environment on which everything else depends and resulted in deterioration in its quality. In view of the speed of globalisation and climate change, Europe has to respond promptly to this situation.</p>

The main problem areas which the draft report addresses are better clarification of the objectives of the programme, a clear position on its financing and more involvement of legislators in further decision making.

      <p sl="fr">How, and to what extent, should we finance the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)? The subject regularly appears on the agenda of the European Parliament. It is now being discussed again, as part of the vote on the extension of the Euratom Framework Programme. Pursuing nuclear research is all well and good, but the research budget should not be devoted exclusively to nuclear energy. Diversification is all the more necessary because, with the exponential increase in the cost of the ITER project since its launch in 2006 – from EUR 6 billion to EUR 16 billion – I believe that the project should continue from now on with the resources it has been given. While research – into both fusion and fission – is a good thing (even if it should be diversified), I deeply regret the increase in appropriations (an additional EUR 700 000 for 2012) and the financial tinkering planned, as it would mean using part of the EU research budget on funding for ITER alone. This is without mentioning the planned budget cuts in the field of research, which will only make the imbalance between spending on research devoted to nuclear energy and on that into renewable energies worse. For these reasons, I voted against the Březina reports on the Euratom Research Framework Programme.</p>

It will be a clean and sustainable form of energy, and will contribute to combating climate change, and to security of supply. ITER is the biggest international cooperation project led by Europe, involving research centres and universities, and it is of the utmost importance for the development of scientific research. Europe should continue to support this project, but I would draw attention to several management mistakes that have been made in the past. It is necessary to ensure careful and responsible management in the future. It is important to find solutions and means of funding that allow the project to be continued. However, I am opposed to solutions that make use of the funding allocated to the Framework Programme for Research, as this puts the rest of the programme’s priorities at risk.</p>

The disagreement among Member States with regard to energy choices rumbles on and has even taken on a new dimension with the Fukushima disaster of 11 March. The research programme clearly must place particular emphasis on the nuclear safety, security and radiation protection standards applied throughout Europe. It is likewise important to focus on the funding of geological disposal projects and to create synergies between the worlds of fission and fusion. Lastly, in view of the need to ensure Europe’s energy independence while diversifying the energy sources used, it is essential for the Euratom Treaty to be reformed and, at the same time, for the European Parliament to be involved in the various aspects of the nuclear issue. It should be borne in mind that nuclear fission still accounts for one-third of the electricity supplied in Europe.</p>

Exploiting the potential for such synergies means that we need to avoid resorting to protectionist measures and competing in an austerity drive with hopes of balancing budgets through exports to partners which are actually mirroring that same strategy.

I find it regrettable, however, that no mention has been made of international trade. Indeed, one notes an increase in protectionism on the US side, an example being the adoption, a few months ago, of the ‘Buy American Act’. That piece of US legislation calls on businesses tendering for a public contract to use only US materials. However, the United States and the European Union are both parties to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, which forbids these kinds of practices. Together with other colleagues, we have recently asked the US authorities to tell us how much of an impact this legislation will have on European businesses. We are expecting a clear and comprehensive response, and we shall remain vigilant with regard to the adoption of any other measure of this nature.

This plan involves short- and medium-term measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">Youth unemployment is, in fact, the most serious economic emergency of recent times. It shows no sign of improvement and has reached levels more than twice as high as the overall unemployment figure. Young adults are being forced to accept badly paid positions offering little job satisfaction or training. Recent research shows that generations starting work in periods of recession remain penalised for the rest of their lives: they experience slower career progression, carry out less fulfilling work and earn significantly lower salaries even many years after their first job.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is more, young people who have found it much harder to enter the world of work also develop a greater aversion to risk that they carry with them throughout their career, making them less ambitious and more reluctant to change jobs.

I welcome the launch in March of this year of the negotiations on concluding an EU-US agreement on the protection of personal data.

I advocated that Member States should launch effective communication programmes to highlight to the general public the issue of net neutrality, as they need to be informed about their rights to be able to report any abuses.

In order to fully exploit the potential of the net, we must also insist on the development of broadband: only when this has been fully completed will we be able to look more closely at the additional opportunities that the Internet can offer us, with enormous advantages from an economic point of view. Finally, consumers must be properly informed about all the conditions of their contracts, and be helped and protected if they decide to switch providers.

This neutrality presupposes that Internet operators and service providers, as well as governments, do not themselves impose restrictions on consumers. In cooperation with the Member States and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, the Commission faces the difficult task of a common approach to the open Internet and neutrality throughout the EU, because only such a common approach will bring tangible results. Consumers must be able to freely choose what service they want and which provider to use. The telecoms community must therefore provide clear, coherent and comparable information to its customers. These measures, together with EU-wide coordination, are needed mainly to avoid potential discriminatory practices by providers, such as manipulating prices for Voice over Internet Protocol or sharing data via File Transfer Protocol or Peer-to-Peer networks. This kind of behaviour not only harms consumers, but also distorts competition.</p>

Of course, the financial crisis has also undermined the ethical conduct of the media in Lithuania. Two years ago, the Lithuanian media’s tax exemption was abolished. Currently, the media must pay 21% tax like other businesses. It is said that this factor has contributed to the spread of corruption in the Lithuanian media.

      <p sl="de">At the instigation of Norway, 46 states signed up to the Oslo Declaration in February 2007 with the declared aim of achieving a worldwide ban on cluster munitions by the end of 2008. The Convention on Cluster Munitions, or CCM, has been in force since 1 August 2010 and has already been ratified by 38 countries, with a further 70 countries in the process of ratification. On the one hand, the CCM prohibits the use and trading of cluster munitions and calls on countries to destroy their existing stockpiles of cluster munitions. Many of the countries that are the main producers of these weapons have not yet signed the agreement, among them, Brazil, India, Pakistan, China, Russia and the US. Cluster bombs mainly pose a threat to civilians, as unexploded munitions are often discovered and detonated by innocent bystanders. I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that every loophole, however small, must be closed to prevent the stockpiling and deployment of these deadly munitions.</p>

First, I call on member states not to sign or ratify the draft text of Protocol VI to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons. This Protocol represents a substantial departure from, and watering down of, the protections contained in the convention itself in a number of important aspects, such as banning pre-1980 cluster munitions, and allowing states with such munitions with a failure rate of less than 1%. If the ban is weakened like this such crude munitions will undoubtedly endanger the lives of civilians in already dangerous parts of the world. Secondly, I endorse the call for the Commission to include, as a basic clause in all of its agreements with third part countries and in all of its external assistance programs, a ban on cluster munitions. Such a strong statement of intent by the Commission would without doubt further highlight the risks associated with cluster munitions and the reasons for their being banned.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament’s vote this afternoon on the resolution on banning cluster munitions was a fine example of unanimity. Alongside the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCW), which has been signed by 110 countries to date, the European Parliament is calling on the Member States not to deviate from the convention and, in particular, to reject Protocol VI, which will be discussed in Geneva this month during the Fourth Review Conference of the CCW. This Protocol VI could permit the use, subject to conditions, of cluster munitions produced after 1980. This is an opportunity to point out the considerable human damage these weapons can cause: 98% of their recorded victims are civilians, and 5% to 40% of cluster munitions fail to explode on impact, thereby turning into anti-personnel mines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Millions of mines and explosive remnants of war are lying dormant in fields and along roads in more than 100 countries today. This is particularly true in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Angola and Vietnam. They kill or maim many years after the end of a conflict and also create another kind of handicap, that of not being able to work the land. Development in countries that often desperately need it is therefore ruled out.</p>

Deeply regrets the fact that the draft text of Protocol VI to be discussed at that conference threatens to undermine the clear and robust international humanitarian law standard established by the CCM, which comprehensively bans cluster munitions, and would also weaken the protection of civilians; 3.

      <p sl="it">Cluster munitions are a major and growing problem. If this type of weapon should come into more widespread use, it will be an even greater humanitarian and development challenge than anti-personnel mines were in the nineties. Cluster munitions are designed to explode on impact with the ground. The percentage of unexploded munitions, however, is related not only to technical factors but also to soil conditions and to the height from which the munitions are launched. Therefore, if the submunitions do not work as expected, they become lodged in the ground, which makes them particularly treacherous, since they can explode at the slightest touch or movement. Indeed, unexploded submunitions behave like anti-personnel mines. For a long time, the key issue was whether the production and use of cluster munitions constituted a violation of international law. I am pleased that, through the resolution adopted this morning, the European Parliament has answered that question: there should be a blanket ban on this type of munitions, which I believe is highly dangerous and illegal.</p>

We support the work that has led to the successful conclusion of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), just as we have fully supported the Ottawa process on banning anti-personnel landmines, balancing the operational requirements of our armed forces with humanitarian concerns. However, the resolution is misleading (e.g. it does not make clear that the use of cluster munitions in Libya was by Gaddafi’s forces against Misrata), exaggerates the effect of a proposed Protocol VI and seeks to endorse the federalising impact of the Treaty of Lisbon and ignore the rights of sovereign national governments by calling for EU accession to the CCM.

I welcome this step, which is in keeping with the behaviour trends among European consumers who are increasingly buying products with cultural content (music, newspapers and magazines, books and so on) from the Internet. At a time when Member States have the chance to apply a lower VAT rate to cultural products on physical media, the aim being to promote access to these products, I do not see why the same products sold online would be treated differently, given that the aim is exactly the same. Therefore, we are dealing with an aspect of the VAT Directive which is obsolete, in view of the new consumption trends. This is why I support the review of the directive so as to introduce equal fiscal treatment for these products, regardless of how they are sold.

I think that the European Union must allow, at least temporarily, for a lower VAT rate to be applied to services with cultural content supplied electronically. This means that European citizens will enjoy more affordable prices for certain online products and services, which would bolster this sector and increase the EU’s competitiveness in this area.

However, if we do nothing, not only will the digital future pass us by; we will also deprive ourselves of a tool for creating growth, competitiveness, cultural diversity and employment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Directive 2009/47/EC permits the optional application (for Member States) of a reduced rate for printed cultural publications (books, newspapers, periodicals and other publications). Directive 2009/47/EC (amended) extended, among other things, the possibility of applying reduced rates to publications on other physical media (DVDs, CDs, etc.) as well. Under the directive, however, reduced VAT may not be applied to publications purchased electronically (via downloading).</p>
      <p sl="it">The object of the motion for a resolution that we are discussing today in the House is to ask the Commission what its intentions are regarding possible legislative initiatives to extend the option of applying reduced VAT to electronic publications, which are currently discriminated against compared to printed publications. My opinion on this issue is that we should also consider a reduction for texts that can be purchased on the Internet and which are therefore increasingly widely available on it. In calling for discrimination of this kind to be eliminated, we demand greater dissemination of culture, especially for young people who, as we know, are increasingly using electronic media to obtain information.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on modernisation of the VAT legislation in order to boost the digital single market. In July 2010, the Council adopted Directive 2010/45/EU on the common system of value added tax as regards the rules on invoicing. This directive, which will be transposed by 1 January 2013, sets out new VAT rules for e-invoicing, thereby creating equal treatment for paper and e-invoices. Without VAT legislation, e-invoicing involves a set of legal requirements which include accounting, audit, personal data protection, archiving and customs regulations. It is reckoned that applying the same VAT rules to both paper invoices and e-invoices will reduce the administrative burden on companies by up to EUR 18 billion in the medium term. To ensure the interoperability of e-invoices and the interconnection between e-invoicing models, commercial partners and service providers should veer towards aligning certain elements such as risk management, addressing and routing, roaming agreements, standards, communication tools and security requirements. By the end of the year, CEN should propose procedures for interoperable addressing and routing in the area of e-invoicing.</p>

However, there are at least two aspects that convinced me to vote against the report. Firstly, the possibility, hinted at in a passage of the report, of a ‘European’ perspective being opened up in the future to Georgia, a country that has, for years, been in an extremely delicate domestic and international situation, having within it two small republics that are essentially autonomous, but not recognised as such by most of the international community.

The ultimate goal of gender mainstreaming is to change habits and institutions in order to be more reflective of the needs, aspirations and experiences of all of society, both women and men. I am pleased that not just the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, but many other European Parliament committees have launched initiatives in various areas, including the own-initiative report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas drawn up by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the public hearing on the role of women in the sustainable development of fisheries areas organised by the Committee on Fisheries. I would like to draw attention to the fact that close cooperation is required with the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) in its role of disseminating accurate methodological tools and with a view to better evaluating gender mainstreaming in Parliament’s work. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to address and prioritise gender inequalities in a more consistent and systematic manner when programming and implementing all policies.

The principal aim of gender mainstreaming is to change the nature and institutions of traditional politics so that they take more account of the needs, aspirations and experiences of society as a whole, both women and men. With this report, Parliament undertakes to adopt and implement on a regular basis a policy plan for gender mainstreaming in the European Parliament, the overall objective of which is to promote equality between women and men through a real and effective gender perspective in all policies and activities in order to assess the different impact of measures on women and men, to coordinate existing initiatives, and to identify goals and priorities as well as the means of achieving them. Personally, I consider a very important commitment to be the incorporation of an analysis of the equality of men and women into all stages of the budgetary process in order to ensure that the needs and priorities of women and men are given equal consideration and that the impact of the allocation of EU resources to women and men is assessed. I consider this approach to budget preparation to be key in the context of the gender equality struggle, and I therefore supported the report.</p>

The crisis must not be used as a pretext for downplaying our focus on gender issues and the fight against inequality.

The TFEU also refers to the fact that ‘the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities’ and that ‘these values are common to the Member States in a society characterised by pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men’. I believe that the incorporation of a gender perspective into the legislative and political work of Parliament can be achieved most effectively through specifically-targeted amendments to draft reports that respond to gender mainstreaming. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) strives to support the incorporation of gender equality into all EU policies and to promote gender mainstreaming in all its institutions and bodies. Gender mainstreaming is of much greater significance than its actual assertion through the implementation of specific measures to help women or in certain cases of sex under-representation. An essential and important part of this effort is also the mobilisation of all general policies and measures aiming to achieve gender equality through concrete steps.</p>

Gender mainstreaming is a strategy that has been actively pursued in the European Parliament for many years. This report which is the first GM report in this legislature, aims to follow the progress and summarise the different tools available in order to help other political bodies of the EP to integrate the gender perspective into their work. I believe that the objective of gender equality needs to be explicitly integrated into all social and economic policy, rather than being handled in isolation. It is important to keep in place what has already been achieved and keep the gender mainstreaming network active. But we also need to move forward and transform the procedure of adopting gender mainstreaming amendments so that it becomes a formally recognised working method of the Parliament. Looking back at the GM reports adopted by the plenary in the past it is reassuring to see that even if the strategy of mainstreaming is not a quick fix solution a steady progress has been made during the years.</p>

Gender mainstreaming can be said to question the gender neutrality of institutions since they may reproduce and contribute to gender inequality through their internal assumptions, working procedures and activities. The concept of gender mainstreaming effectively entered the mainstream of international public policy in September of 1995, when it featured in the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, which defined the term broadly and committed the institutions of the UN system to the systematic incorporation of a gender perspective into policymaking. In 1997, the United Nations defined gender mainstreaming as: ‘ … the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women’s as well as men’s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated.’</p>

As an advocate of gender equality wherein the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is conducting its excellent work, Parliament must present an example where it concerns promoting gender equality in its agencies or the administrative structure. I am happy that this is already reflected in the work of many parliamentary committees. It is necessary to make sure that this practice should be not just a nice exception but an ongoing normal mode of operation. With this in mind I also support dual leadership in the political groups, equal gender distribution in the EP governing bodies and at the highest level of the parliamentary administration.

The European Union has a special responsibility when it comes to combating IUU fishing, since it constitutes the world's largest market for fish, and it is one of the major fishing powers. Thus, its aim should be to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. This report presents the following recommendations for achieving that goal: improve the investigative capacity into organised criminal activities at sea; improve transparency and traceability of fish to expose criminal activities and reduce their profits; monitor or, preferably prohibit, the sale of used fishing vessels to companies with untraceable beneficial owners; and improve monitoring of fishing vessel activities and their interactions with merchant vessels. For these reasons, I supported this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Illegal fishing is a widespread phenomenon: a recent study estimates that it accounts for between 11 and 26 million tonnes per year. In 2011, the FAO adopted a plan of action to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which is a priority of the international community. Some progress has been made in specific fisheries. Nonetheless, in many places the statement is still valid.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, the EU has a special responsibility when it comes to combating illegal fishing. It is, in fact, the world’s largest market for fish products. Since approximately two-thirds of the world’s oceans are beyond areas of national jurisdiction, it is clear that national efforts and regional cooperation are not enough to combat lawlessness.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to establish new regional fisheries management organisations or to extend the mandate of existing ones, to cover areas and/or species not currently regulated. Moreover, since illegal fishing is facilitated by a lack of access to information, I believe it is a priority to introduce measures aimed precisely at increasing transparency in the market.</p>

      <p sl="it">The own-initiative report concerns a very important issue for the conservation of biodiversity and the health of marine fauna. All the statistics worldwide show us that illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a growing problem on a worldwide scale. In addition, IUU fishing is increasingly linked to other activities threatening peace and the stability of civil coexistence between people. An increasing number of ships conceal criminal and terrorist activities and drug smuggling, and criminal organisations use the vast tracts of the sea where IUU fishing takes place precisely because these areas are difficult to monitor by the national and regional public authorities. Therefore I approve wholeheartedly of this report, and others on the same topic, because the EU must contribute to the international community’s efforts to combat IUU fishing, and ask itself and the other Member States to do everything possible to eradicate this criminal activity, which encourages crime and puts the survival of the marine ecosystem at risk and, indirectly, threatens national security.</p>

It therefore has a major responsibility to play a key role in mobilising the international community in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. IUU fishing is unfortunately a major environmental and economic problem worldwide, in both marine and freshwater fisheries, undermining fisheries management efforts and threatening the sustainability of fish stocks and food security. It also distorts the market, with incalculable social and economic repercussions on society as a whole, including developing countries. IUU fishing and associated commercial activities constitute unfair competition for fishermen and others who operate in a law-abiding fashion and create economic difficulties for fishing communities, consumers and the entire sector. In combating illegal fishing we therefore need to increase coordination between the Commission, the Community Fisheries Control Agency and the Member States in order to improve information gathering and exchange and assist in the rigorous and transparent application of Union fisheries legislation. Moreover, the Member States and the Commission should ensure that illegal fishing is combated at sea and in inland waters.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately, illegal fishing exists, and it also produces quite negative and harmful effects for the formal economy throughout the world, as well as for the sustainable preservation of our natural resources. Because of the nature of unreported fishing, it is impossible to assess accurately the volume caught and its economic value. However, it is thought to account for at least 15% of total catches. In light of this fact, and because we all want to continue to eat wild fish in the future, I consider it crucial that the Union, as the largest world market for fish and one of the major world fishing powers, should set an example for the rest of the world to follow. It is therefore imperative to ensure that the right to fish should be subject to objective criteria of transparency as regards the ownership of operations and catches. It is also essential that Member States that do not comply with their obligations should lose their fishing rights. There is still a lot to be done. The report takes this into account. I therefore believe that, whether through better cooperation among Member States or at European level, it is possible to combat organised and sporadic crime in the fisheries sector and to promote the formal, transparent and sustainable development of this activity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In essence, the report takes an approach we consider to be appropriate to the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Enhancing the role of multilateral organisations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in combating a practice that is very damaging to marine ecosystems is, in our opinion, appropriate, as is enhancing the role of the regional fisheries management organisations. In addition to the environmental consequences, this is a practice that also has economic and social consequences that are extremely harmful, in some cases with extensions and links to organised crime. Without prejudice to aspects that require further clarification with regard to combating IUU fishing inside the EU, an area where we will certainly have some differences of opinion with the rapporteur, we welcome a number of proposals presented in the report, some of which are innovative (such as those relating to market states, amongst others). We must, however, highlight the profoundly negative amendments proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which have been approved, on the creation of a ‘European Coastguard’ with the job of monitoring, inspecting and combating what are deemed to be ‘future dangers at sea’, such as ‘terrorism’ and ‘piracy’.

      <p sl="pt">Fishing is a global activity, as inevitably is the illegal part of it. Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing causes significant harm to a common heritage of humankind, of which the oceans and their immense but finite resources form a part. It is estimated that it accounts for at least 15% of the total volume of catches, although it may in fact account for a much higher percentage. Preserving this heritage is undoubtedly a task and a responsibility for all humankind. For this reason, it is a priority that we take into account the fight against illegal fishing in the context of the international cooperation established among multilateral organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Thus, of particular importance are the FAO agreement on measures to be implemented by port states, the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, the FAO Compliance Agreement and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We disagree, however, on the creation of a European coastguard, as proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).

It is therefore justified in playing a crucial role in mobilising the international community in combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing). Such fishing is one of the most serious threats to the biodiversity of the world’s oceans. It is also a significant environmental and economic problem worldwide in marine and freshwater fishing and undermines efforts to manage fishing. It also threatens the sustainability of fish stocks and food security and distorts the market, which has an incalculable social and economic effect, and in particular a negative impact on society as a whole.

Illegal fishing unfairly competes with legal fishing and also often goes hand in hand with serious social conditions. There is no international framework today in which to share common standards.

During the forthcoming debates on the common fisheries policy, I will, however, be keeping a close eye on the issue of sanctions, which is raised in this report. Indeed, the resolution recommends withdrawing European subsidies for those who breach the rules. This proposal will need to be discussed with local players before it is taken any further. The entry into force of the point-based licence is also welcomed; I am unable to support this given the state of the current implementing arrangements.

I agree that a system of global ocean governance is essential for managing fisheries, especially on the high seas, and that the current approach is a clear failure. International agreements must be negotiated to ensure that the right to fish is conditional on minimum criteria relating to transparency of ownership, operations and catches and traceability of the product, etc., and that States not fulfilling their responsibilities lose their fishing rights. As a final note, many of the above recommendations would require significant resources to implement. Many developing countries would have difficulty in finding such resources, so means must be found for providing assistance. This is a common situation these days.

      <p sl="es">The European Union, which has regulations covering this issue, has a special responsibility since it is a leading actor in the sector and the main world market. I congratulate the rapporteur for a report containing many initiatives aimed at bringing transparency to ships, licences and catches, and to planning and managing fishing activities in the high seas, coastal waters, ports and markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">I thank you for accepting my amendments asking for an organisation within the United Nations system to carry out independent evaluation of flagged states’ compliance with the regulations, to seek international legal instruments for prosecuting and punishing the illegal fishing trade and to support the FAO’s efforts to do away with ports of convenience that are gateways for the trade in illegal catches.</p>

      <p sl="it">Illegal fishing undermines efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks in all capture fisheries. When confronted with this phenomenon, national and regional fisheries management organisations can fail to achieve management goals. This situation leads to the loss of both short- and long-term social and economic opportunities and to negative effects on food security and environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="it">With its new legislation, the EU has armed itself with tools to combat illegal fishing. If the EU is to persuade other States to act as well, then the EU must itself be above reproach. The existing Regional Fishers Management Organisations (RFMOs) vary widely in their approach to illegal fishing and the legal measures, including sanctions, that they employ to combat it. Most of the ideas to combat the phenomenon need to be implemented among RFMOs. Finally, the EU could simultaneously support current global initiatives as well as proposing new ones.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The issue of illegal fishing is one of the European Union’s major concerns in the context of fisheries policy. Despite the difficulty in determining the volume of illegal fishing, it has been assessed at between 11 and 26 million tonnes a year. The European Union has a special responsibility in this area, as it is one of the major fishing powers and the world’s largest market. Parliament has therefore supported a series of proposals relating to initiatives in international organisations, the enhancement of transparency and the role of the EU in this area, as well as cooperation among Member States and combating organised crime in order to help solve the problem of illegal fishing.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the EU’s role in combating illegal fishing at global level because the Commission and Member States must cooperate with a view to setting up a European coastguard service in order to boost the monitoring and inspection capacity and effectively combat dangers at sea such as terrorism, piracy, illegal fishing, trafficking or even marine pollution. I voted for the amendment which urges the Commission to continue its efforts to promote the exchange of information in order to integrate maritime surveillance and, in particular, information aimed at harmonising coastguard services at European level. Maintaining and developing the European fisheries sector depend, to a certain extent, on strict monitoring of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) activities involving fishery products traded on European and global markets. We should stress the importance of this sector for regional planning, food safety and preserving jobs and resources in EU waters. Past limitations with regard to monitoring, control and surveillance of fishing activities have been largely overcome by technological advances, including developments in space and satellite communication technologies. Indeed, the solution for combating IUU fishing lies primarily with governments finding the political will to act effectively and responsibly.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome today’s report which calls for the EU to lead the fight against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing. The only way to deal with this issue is by taking international action, and the EU needs to take an active role in order to protect EU fishermen and fishing industries. Illegal fishing is extremely difficult to regulate. I welcome calls to close markets to illegal seafood and to impose sanctions on states that do not meet international obligations. Putting a stop to illegal fishing now is vital – fish stocks are dangerously low and the threat of illegal fishing could prove disastrous for many people who make their living in this industry. I fully support proposals for better coordination between countries and believe that the EU needs to work with big players such as Japan, the US and China to see how this can be stamped out on a global level.</p>

I am convinced that, as the largest importer of fisheries products and the owner of one of the largest fleets in the world, the Union must set an example so as to mobilise the entire international community. Given that two-thirds of marine spaces are located on the high seas and do not come under any national jurisdiction, only a joint solution at global level can be effective. IUU fishing accounts for more than 15% of catches and threatens not only the sustainable management of marine resources but also the sector as a whole. However, the tools for combating this scourge already exist within the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the EU. I find it regrettable, therefore, that the only thing that should be missing today is the political will to apply these tools universally and responsibly. It is up to us alone to take action today to preserve our oceans. Everyone needs to contribute to this effort: the member countries of the FAO by honouring their commitments, but also the public by consuming these dwindling resources responsibly.</p>

Although a nine-figure sum was provided each year under the common fisheries policy in the 2007-2013 financial framework, European fish stocks are now in a terrible state. It is obvious that the money was not correctly spent. Thus, in the belief that the midnight hour is about to strike for our oceans, I have voted in favour of a European coastguard service also being financed from these EU funds in the future. Most of these proposals mentioned relate to good fisheries management. In respect of the prevention of illegal fishing, which is estimated at 15%, a package of measures for greater transparency will be presented. I am certain that mandatory transparency requirements and effective prevention mechanisms are essential elements in a successful campaign to prevent illegal fishing.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, at this moment, Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, has the life of the Iranian pastor Youcef Nadarkhani is his hands. Nadarkhani has been sentenced to death for apostasy, or rejecting Islam. This is a court sentence that directly contravenes Iran’s constitution, its criminal law and also international treaty obligations that Tehran has entered into.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A pronouncement from Khamenei releasing him should, in all reason, be on the verge of being issued. However, given that that has still not happened means that those close to Nadarkhani, the condemned pastor, fear a dramatic end to his case in the mostly quiet Christmas period of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I call on you all – ladies and gentlemen, the Council and the Commission – to not leave Nadarkhani in the lurch. Raise your voices! Call on the Iranian authorities to exonerate him!</p>
      <p sl="nl">An Iranian journalist called me late last night. I can still hear her voice asking why Europe was making so little noise when Nadarkhani’s life hung in the balance. It is up to us, up to the European institutions, to give this pressing question a convincing, dignified answer. It goes without saying that the same applies to all the violations of fundamental civil rights in Iran that are on the agenda this afternoon.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we are discussing again the human rights situation in Iran, which confirms our fears about the practice of the government in Tehran of responding to legitimate public discontent by resorting to force and abusive measures, in contempt for international public opinion. The abuses committed by the Iranian authorities concern in particular minority groups, whether they are religious groups, journalists, women or human rights activists. Any attempt to form a responsible civil society and any kind of rejection of the government methods used by those in power in Iran are brutally suppressed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Iran should give some answers to the legitimate objections and concerns expressed by the international community about the human rights situation. It has chosen to do this by increasing internal repression and restricting even more the freedom of expression, as well as other civil rights and freedoms. This attitude fully justifies the sanctions that have been imposed by the international community. The government in Tehran must show reason and put a stop to the abusive practices it currently resorts to.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, persecution of opposition and repressions on charges of so-called religious offences require a decisive and condemning response from our side. A most recent horrendous example is the case of the actress Marzieh Vafamehr, sentenced to a year in prison and 90 lashes for starring in a film dealing with infringement on artistic freedom. This sentence is even more preposterous since no specific charges have been defined nor has the sentence ever been substantiated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In developing economic contacts with Iran the EU countries must proceed from this absolute priority – prisoners of conscience must be freed, and among them Pastor Yousef Nadar Khani, who has been sentenced to capital punishment. This is why I am appealing to the Council so that European companies are held back until repressions against Iranian residents are eased and pressure can be applied through coordinated sanctions. This is the only possible way to persuade the authorities of Teheran to cooperate with the UN, providing its special envoy with unrestricted control in all parts of the country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, one minute is far too short to recite the litany of human rights violations in Iran. As we all know, these include arrests and arbitrary detention, unfair trials, torture and degrading treatment, discrimination against various minorities and the death penalty. I am going to speak about the last item. As we are aware, the global trend is towards abolishing the death penalty. Several UN resolutions call for a global moratorium to be introduced. In spite of these actions, Iran remains the country with the highest proportion of death penalty sentences per capita. In most cases, these executions actually take place in secret. Various reports mention that more than 300 secret executions were carried out last year. Sometimes minors are victims of these executions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would actually like to add my voice to that of my colleague who demanded the immediate release of Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, accused of apostasy because he converted to Christianity at the age of 19. In conclusion, I believe that the dialogue on human rights between the European Union and Iran must be resumed to be able to raise the issue of the death penalty, not to mention the other human rights violations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, where to start? The nuclear dossier dominates our political agendas and campaign rhetoric, but let us never forget the ongoing human rights violations in Iran. These are always important, but especially with regard to the upcoming elections in spring of next year. With opposition candidates in de facto imprisonment, the ongoing crackdown on citizens, women’s rights, free speech, media online and offline, torture and rape in prisons and the execution rate higher than it has ever been – higher than in China – including juveniles, the situation is very, very dire.</p>
      <p sl="en">In light of all these atrocities, we may wonder what we can do to help the brave Iranians. The future of Iran lies in the hands of the Iranian people and I am confident that they will prevail, but even with EU and UN sanctions in place, EU-based ICT companies continue to provide spyware, surveillance, monitoring, tracking and tracing technologies and know-how to those in power in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must end the facilitation of censorship, the hampering of press freedom and access to information, and the crackdown on people facilitated by EU-based companies. Dual use regulations are not enough: we need EU-wide standards, licensing before trade and, most importantly, mechanisms to forge transparency and accountability to ensure that EU-based ICT companies do not undermine the EU’s strategic interests and, most importantly, the human rights of Iranian people.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, recent headlines in the international media are once again drawing attention to the nuclear conflict with Iran. For this reason it is right that we in the European Parliament should focus on the continuing seriousness of the situation in respect of human rights and that we should not allow this to be forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our resolution enumerates the various serious human rights violations meted out to many of Iran’s citizens. This is a terrible, horrific and very lengthy list. As an example I would draw attention to the humiliating practice of whipping students. We are now demanding that the Iranian penal code should be amended and that corporal punishment should be abolished.</p>
      <p sl="de">In his interim report the UN Special Rapporteur on Iran has spoken of a deteriorating situation regarding human rights, referring to a ‘systematic programme of torture’. We call on the Iranian Government to take this report seriously and to allow the UN Special Rapporteur to enter the country immediately.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our resolution is also intended for businesses located in the EU that supply technical expertise and equipment to Iran. This technology has helped the regime to persecute human rights activists and to suppress civil protest.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Iranian Government has let it be known that it is developing an Internet system that will operate in parallel with or as an alternative to the open worldwide Internet system. This will adhere to Islamic principles, as a kind of Halal network. If one takes a closer look, it becomes evident that this will be a mechanism for controlling and regulating the public at large, although there will be exceptions for banks and traders.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am highly critical of the fact that technology is being supplied to Iran from Europe that permits censorship, filtering and surveillance. I would call on businesses to put a stop to such practices, as otherwise they share responsibility for the human rights violations committed there.</p>

The report of 4 November from the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights mentions the high number of executions, including in public and by stoning, the use of torture, the cruelty of sentences, such as the amputation of limbs, arbitrary arrests, unfair trials, discrimination, the draconian restriction on the freedom of expression and association, all of which are warnings which we must heed urgently.

It is, however, clear from the ongoing developments in the country that the assertion of the policy of radical Islam there is taking an ever more brutal form. The growing repression against opponents of the regime, defenders of human rights, journalists, students and the lawyers who defend them, and even against family members, is increasing in severity and intensity.

However, the Iraqi prime minister declared that he would like to close the camp by the end of this year, thereby creating the conditions for an extremely dire humanitarian situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In light of this, the European Union’s appointment of a representative responsible for Camp Ashraf is a positive step. This is why I believe that he must be involved in having the deadline for disbanding the camp postponed until the refugees can be transferred safely to third countries. It is also the duty of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to administer rapidly the process of resettling these persons and guarantee them protection. The situation of the Iranian asylum seekers in Camp Ashraf can only be resolved peacefully.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, yesterday, in the European Parliament, we heard about the torture and abuse that people are suffering in Iranian prisons, and heard about what is happening to them in the street, or even in their own homes and at university. It is disgusting that the Iranian authorities have such a misogynistic policy!</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would also like to draw your attention to the plight of the refugees in Camp Ashraf, because the Iraqi government has decided to close this camp, this refugee camp, by the end of the year. We have very little time to decide how to ensure the safety of these people; therefore I expect more resolute decision-making from the European Union. I call on Baroness Ashton to condemn this act, this decision of the Iraqi government, which I myself also condemn, and call on the United Nations Refugee Agency to urgently interview these people and ensure their safety.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The worst thing that can happen is that these people remain in Iraq. It is crucial that we ensure they can be resettled in third countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this resolution but I want to make one correction. Iran is not an Islamic republic: it is a brutal dictatorship that uses and abuses and perverts religion for its own barbaric ends. This dictatorship also targets and persecutes people who are Muslim as well as other religions. We have stood by and we have watched people being hung by their neck, young men of 18 hung by their neck solely because they were homosexual. And still they target homosexuals and transgender people, and deny them access to health, goods, services, housing, and education. But I am optimistic, because despite these crackdowns, despite this brutality, men and women continually rise up against this regime, and their hope should give us hope and our voices must speak for them.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, with the few seconds I have, I am going to confine myself to commemorating a name and to launching an appeal. The name is Dr Abdul-Reza Soudbakhsh, a physician and professor at Tehran University, who visited and examined the victims of Kahrizak prison, known for holding opponents of the Iranian regime, and who did not cover up his conclusions that those victims had died as a result of acts of torture.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, Dr Abdul-Reza Soudbakhsh himself has since been murdered.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The appeal is as follows: the fact that we know that there are European companies collaborating with the Iranian regime, whether by blocking opposition television broadcasts or by providing censorship software, is an offence to the memory of courageous people like this Iranian man.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must tell the Commission, which is here in this debate, that companies which collaborate in the violation of human rights should not receive a penny in European subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is possible to do this using existing legal bases. However, we can do more. I do not understand how the Commission can fine companies for breaching competition laws, for example, but it cannot fine European companies who sully Europe’s name by collaborating in the breach of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to hear a response from the Commission to this appeal, and I want all of us to unite to ensure that these companies do not receive a penny out of the pockets of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, a regime sets about tightening the screws when it is either aware of its growing feebleness or has a sense of total impunity. We are dealing, probably, with the latter case; the official Tehran is likely to believe that no one from the outside – neither the European Union nor the United States – is capable of administering a public upbraiding and influencing their decisions. Thus, our responsibility is only greater.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I totally agree that we must do all we can to avoid hypocrisy and double standards. If the European Union is striving to safeguard human rights, Iran included, then we ought not to support, finance and offer grants to businesses supportive of the regime in Tehran. I believe we are called upon to be completely transparent and unequivocal with respect to this issue. We remember yet another thing: we, as the European Parliament, are not omnipotent but we must feel that we have done everything in our power to save as many innocent people as we can.</p>

      <p sl="de">Sanctions against the people will simply strengthen the hand of the perpetrators and this cannot be what the European Union wants. We do not need to punish the innocent by imposing sanctions on them. Instead we need legally binding judgments against the perpetrators.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the High Representative and the Commission as a whole, I welcome this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress that the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran is dreadful and is deteriorating. Abuses committed by the Iranian authorities are harming more and more individuals and organisations and worsening the climate of fear and suspicion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights defenders, lawyers, political leaders, students and journalists are harassed, imprisoned, sometimes tortured. Religious minorities, homosexuals, women’s activists, artists and film-makers are also targeted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iran continues to ignore its international obligations and its people have nowhere to turn. Frequent arrests of human rights defenders and lawyers, the interruptions of Internet and the interceptions of mobile phone communications, the situation of religious minorities, the continued house arrest of political leaders and the extremely high number of executions are sad and striking illustrations of this trend.</p>
      <p sl="en">A lot of you referred to some special cases, so let me also give you some information.</p>
      <p sl="en">Referring to the Christian pastor, Youcef Nadarkhani, we are on the same line as Parliament. Iran must live up to its international human rights obligations, also on freedom of religion. The High Representative has publicly called on Iran to release Mr Nadarkhani and drop the apostasy charges against him, and is following this case closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also on your side and have condemned publicly the detention and sentencing of prominent film-makers and artists you have referred to: Jafar Panahi and Mrs Vafamehr. We welcome the release of Mrs Vafamehr, but remain very concerned at the targeting of the artistic community which threatens the expression of artistic freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree with your call on Iran to put a moratorium on the death penalty and to help all pending cases. An issue of particular concern is the execution of juvenile offenders, as happened last September. This is really appalling.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is therefore actively working on trying to improve the human rights situation in Iran. Let me give you some examples of our actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We use public diplomacy: the impressive number of public statements this year on human rights in Iran reflects the gravity of the situation. Nothing more or less than that. In order to reach out to an Iranian public, the statements are translated into Farsi and posted on the web with alerts from the High Representative via Twitter.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Tehran and in Brussels, EU services continue to demarche Iran on human rights cases, seeking information and conveying our messages strongly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The United Nations’ General Assembly will this year again consider a resolution on human rights in Iran, which enjoys full EU backing. We also want access to Iran for the United Nations special rapporteur, Dr Shaheed, whose mandate was created at our initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">In April and in October this year, EU Foreign Ministers adopted the list of 61 Iranian individuals responsible for great human rights violations. So we are not going against the Iranian people, we are going against Iranian individuals. Their assets in the EU are frozen and they cannot travel here.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel to the sanctions, we have let Iran know that we are open for contacts on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish by saying that there is unfortunately no country in the world that receives as much attention on human rights from the EU as Iran does. This House should have no doubt about our determination to do what we can to promote and protect human rights in Iran. I know the European Parliament shares this extreme concern and I thank you for that.</p>

      <p sl="pl">While the European Union respects autonomy of third countries it cannot turn a blind eye to such burning issues as the use of capital punishment. Iran is a country where executions of citizens are carried out at a level among the highest in the world. Thanks to efforts undertaken by numerous non-governmental organisations, multiple cases of human rights violations by the Iranian authorities have now been documented. Fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by every human being are not respected in Iran. Furthermore, according to the UN, the executions are carried out on an even greater scale than is registered in the official data, for many executions are performed in secret. Recent arrests and death penalties are mostly applied to either human rights activists who make their beliefs public, or to political opponents of those in power. The Iranian regime is indefatigable in imposing the atmosphere of intimidation while public unrests are exacerbated by the continuous use of violence, arrests or judicial harassment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As representatives of the European Community we must raise our voices on behalf of those who are denied their rights. We must direct the attention of the whole of Europe to the plight of those whose rights are continuously infringed upon. The European Parliament, in its capacity of an advocate of human rights, freedom of speech and democracy, must exhort the Iranian authorities to abolish capital punishment immediately, free the accused and respect human rights. Only by going down this route shall we maintain and further develop political and economic relations between Iran and European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, all of us welcomed the events last spring in Egypt, the events that filled us with a lot of hope. Egypt is a country of extreme importance – not only for the region but, one is allowed to say, for the entire world. It is difficult to ignore a country with a population of over 70 million; a country whose cultural significance in the Arab world is huge. There is yet another reason for hoping that Egypt shall become a luminous example of democratic changes and an example of what we, the residents of Europe – as neighbours with the Arabic world – forever hold dear: Egypt must be an example of modernity that is capable of functioning in the context of democracy in the world permeated with Islamic values. We all should care about this so that we could say that Arabic states, Islamic states, share the same democratic values as those of us who live in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, more and more signals are emerging to let us know that events taking place in Egypt today inspire no optimism. There are still cases when human rights are violated – not to mention the issue that we were discussing here not too long ago, that is, the rights of the minority of Christian Copts in Egypt, the rights that are routinely violated. Today we are dealing with the specific case concerning freedom of speech.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to appeal from this podium to the Parliament to issue a clear signal to the people of Egypt and to the authorities of Egypt: we welcome changes underway over there but would want those changes to be for the better, not for the worse. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Hosni Mubarak’s departure from the office of president of the Republic of Egypt has paved the way for an interim military government to take over the Egyptian state.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The events during a peaceful demonstration for the rights of Coptic Christians in October this year, in which more than 25 civilians were killed and more than 300 injured, have shown that the interim Egyptian government is losing its sense of proportion when it comes to peaceful and civilised conduct in the country. The persecution of the bloggers, Alaa Abd El-Fattah and Maikel Nabil Sanad, and of thousands of other civilians before military courts, confirms that the interim government is starting to use authoritarian methods of government.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Egyptian military courts do not meet the requirements of Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in particular as regards the right to an impartial and independent assessment of a charge. We cannot, therefore, accept the continuation of trials of Egyptian civilians before military tribunals, and we strongly urge the interim government immediately to return to civilised and decent methods of ruling the country.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, many of us in this House welcomed the so-called Arab Spring, but the revolutions are not unfolding in the same way everywhere. The Tunisians have just elected their constituent assembly in a democratic framework that no one challenged, and the democratic transition seems to be well under way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, Tunisia is the only country about which we can be optimistic. In Libya, there is talk of introducing Sharia law; in Syria, men and women are being killed every day; and in Egypt, we can only be worried. NGOs estimate that more than 12 000 civilians have been tried before military courts since March 2011. On 30 October, so too was the blogger Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who was already imprisoned under Hosni Mubarak. His counterpart, Maikel Nabil Sanad, suffered the same fate. Both men refused to cooperate with the military courts. They symbolise the Egyptian people’s right to civil justice. They symbolise the repression that is still suffered today by critics of the regime and of its soldiers, in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There can be no democracy without the right to a fair trial and without freedom of expression. With the Egyptian elections 10 days away, we must send a strong message to the Egyptian authorities so that they actually guarantee the rights of all their fellow citizens.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the subject of today’s debate and resolution concerns the specific cases of the bloggers Alaa Abd El-Fattah and Maikel Nabil Sanad. As representatives of 500 million European citizens we call for their immediate release.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, these cases are symptomatic of the stage which Egypt is at. We are receiving a great deal of information and analyses about the pressure and harassment which journalists, human rights defenders and activists are being subject to. Between March this year and now, more than 12 000 civilians have appeared before military courts. The election campaign is starting, but the country is still applying emergency legislation which grants the army and military courts special rights.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We still do not know the exact details of what happened on 9 October in Cairo and who is to blame for the 25 human lives taken. The Egyptian authorities must be accountable, above all, to their people, but also to us Europeans who are continuing to look upon Egypt with hope, sympathy and readiness to provide support.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We are very much aware from our own history that the path to democracy is long, complicated and involves many internal tensions and conflicts. The removal of Mubarak can be compared with a strong earthquake which rearranges the strata, changes the relief, opens old wounds and creates new tensions.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We know that there will be lots of after-shocks. However, we want to be sure that the course set for democracy in the spring, the defence of human rights and social progress will be maintained and that Egypt will progress with ever-increasing certainty along it. This is why we express our solidarity with everyone who is working for this in Egypt at the moment.</p>

That is why it is particularly important that during the ‘current transition period’, as it is referred to, the international community exercises complete zero tolerance towards violations of human and fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We particularly want this resolution to make an appeal on behalf of the blogger, Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who has been held by the military government and whose case, like many others, has been heard by a military court. The chain of events began with a peaceful demonstration in Maspero in support of the freedom of religion of the Coptic Christians and led to the army’s intervention, the slaughter of 25 Christians, the wounding of hundreds of others, and charges being brought against Abd El-Fattah in a military court.</p>

They demand justice and human rights to be respected. We support their calls for freedom and we are humble about the decisions that some of the European Member State governments have made in the past, but we are equally ambitious and committed to establishing a real partnership with Egypt in the future. But which Egypt?</p>
      <p sl="en">I truly hope we can speak about a new Egypt, but I worry about the way in which the Supreme Council of the armed forces is showing the exact same characteristics as under Mubarak. More than 12 000 civilians have been tried before military courts since the revolution. This injustice must end. I stand with those Egyptians who believe military courts do not have legitimacy. This is also true according to Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights defender and blogger Alaa Abd El-Fattah is one of the latest victims. Tomorrow he will celebrate his birthday in a cramped prison cell. From prison, under awful circumstances, he awaits the charges brought against him, trumped-up charges. He also awaits the birth of his son. His wife is due to deliver a baby boy any day. They had faith in the birth of a new Egypt, an Egypt that would provide opportunities for the new generation. His son will be named Khaled after Khaled Saeed who was murdered by the police.</p>
      <p sl="en">Alaa Abd El-Fattah is a symbol and there are many other symbols that represent the thousands who are imprisoned including Maikel Nabil, another blogger who has been mentioned. The injustice goes on and we support the Egyptians’ peaceful call for a truly new Egypt. That must start with the end of military trials for civilians and the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Egypt is at the brink of falling into old patterns and not even necessarily with new faces. As the elections of 28 November approach, civil liberties and human rights are threatened more than ever in Egypt since the revolution. Since March 2011, more than 12 000 civilians have been tried before military courts. Many democracy activists and bloggers such as Abd El-Fattah and Nabil have been imprisoned – some have even been tortured. We demand their release and civilian trials for civilians.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that this is not an atmosphere and an environment in which truly democratic elections can take place. At the same time, the EU and Baroness Ashton speak in empty phrases and seem to put stability once again before clear and unequivocal support for human rights. In a letter to Members of this House, sent on 28 October, Baroness Ashton called the announcement of the Egyptian military to stop military trials a necessary step, and that is it. No further call on the Egyptian authorities to actually implement their pledges and to respect fundamental human rights. I find this unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Together with my colleague, Ms Schaake, who just spoke, we have urged the High Representative to re-examine the facts and to support the European Parliament which has repeatedly condemned military trials for civilians in the strongest terms and continues to do so today with this urgency resolution. The EU has no choice; if we stand aside in the interest of false stability we risk losing the little credibility we have left in the region. Real stability will only come if human rights and democracy are taken seriously. The Egyptians can be so proud of what they have achieved, and we need to support them in order to achieve their dreams and their hopes.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, detention of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, an Egyptian blogger and political activist, is a worrying example of how human rights are violated in Egypt – even after the termination of Mubarak’s rule. Alaa Abd El-Fattah played a prominent role as a blogger and reporter who was providing an objective description of events during the revolution. On 30 October, Mr Fattah was summoned by the Military Prosecutor and presented with a charge of inciting violence and aggression against the military during the clashes on 9 October in Cairo. As a civilian, Mr Fattah refused to submit himself to the investigation conducted by the military tribunal and was, therefore, arrested.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The situation with Mr Fattah is not an isolated case. Powers vested in the interim government of Egypt during the state of emergency are used as a tool for detaining bloggers, journalists and human rights activists. Since last March military tribunals have sentenced over 12 thousand civilians. At this key point in the course of democratic change we support unswervingly such developments within the state that are founded on principles of democracy and respect for the rights of its citizens: freedom of expression, association, religion or beliefs.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Alaa Abd El-Fattah is an Egyptian blogger and hard man to crack. He was imprisoned in the time of President Mubarak for having created a blog aggregator that operated without censorship. When he came out of prison, his wife, Manal, immediately said that there was no going back, and together, he and Manal, who is also an uncompromising blogger, created an opposition blog which is among the most widely read in Egypt, and which they kept whilst in exile.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When the revolution broke out they returned to Egypt and were in Tahrir Square, where they gave a good account of themselves. Then, after the revolution, they continued with the same type of monitoring of the new regime as they had done with the old Mubarak regime. This Alaa Abd El-Fattah did very openly, and it was this that led the new military regime to arrest him on utterly spurious charges and to subject him to a military trial. His sister, Mona Seif, is the president of an organisation calling for an end to military trials, not only for her brother but also for the 12 000 civilians who are imprisoned and facing military trials. She is another of these uncompromising Egyptians, as are all the courageous and admirable Egyptians who have fought for freedom in Egypt and who are still fighting.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is up to us not only to state that we are with them, that we will not abandon them and that we commemorate them here; we must also stop being so lenient towards the new military regime in Egypt. The new military regime cannot be a kind of Mubarak regime without Mubarak. We have been too patient for too long, especially for fear of … that is to say, there have been allegations of religious intolerance, in which the Egyptian army in fact had a hand. Here we are again lapsing into Europe’s old errors, making friends among Egypt’s powerful in order to secure peace among the minorities.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the case of the blogger Alaa Abd El-Fattah is only a small symbolic illustration of the fecklessness of our policies. The Arab spring celebrations, in which unknown people came to power with unsuspected objectives and interests with the help of the European Union states, resulted in the arrest of people guilty of one thing, namely having their own opinion. We must learn once and for all that you cannot support people for whom slogans about human rights and democracy are no more than a smokescreen concealing their lust for power and their defence of their own privileges. Most of the problems of North Africa and the Middle East are long-term in nature and have social roots that are often fundamentally linked to European colonialism. The hasty resolution of these problems, in particular through war, purely and simply leads to new problems that are often even worse. However, just as before the attack on Iraq, we are once again seeing confrontational policies that prevent any manoeuvring, rather than seeking compromises and paths to understanding and change. I must again stress that it is easier to make war than to build peace. Easier and cheaper. Must millions of Iraqis really become refugees, or Sirte be bombed, for the sake of our policies?</p>
      <p sl="cs">Europe’s role should be the cultivated and unambiguous promotion of human rights without any policy of double standards. I agree with Turkish calls for a speedy resolution of the situation in Syria. But I do not understand why violence can be used to suppress Kurdish rebels, and yet violence may not be used to suppress Syrian rebels. The fate of Alaa Abd El-Fattah should remind us that human rights are indivisible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Egypt is a fine country; very attractive with a noble and indeed romantic history, but the activities of the military junta is not doing its reputation any favours. In particular, I think the treatment of Coptic Christians is not acceptable by any means, and I say that as a Christian myself and as a member of the EPP, which is the Christian Democrat party. Certainly, we need to do more to stand up for Christians and indeed everybody who is being persecuted in the name of religion around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The case of Mr Fattah is particularly important today and he is to be congratulated on his courage in not accepting a trial by the military junta, and of course he has been put in prison as a result. We have to support in every way we can the ‘No to Military Trials’ movement which is asking all Egyptians not to cooperate with the military tribunals. In that way, we might move forward in the name of freedom, in the name of the people of Egypt.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we applauded together the changes that took place in Egypt this spring and we expressed our solidarity with those who fought for democracy and freedom in the centre of Egypt’s capital. Unfortunately, we have to say that the changes in Egypt are minimal, that the methods and abuse are continuing and that the army is governing by force and ignoring the objections voiced by the international community. We have witnessed an upsurge in internal violence in Egypt in the last two months, violence which has also affected minority religious groups, such as the Coptic Christians.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Based on the information provided by human rights activists in Egypt, more than 12 000 civilians have appeared before military courts following the downfall of the Mubarak regime, which raises serious question marks about the process of democratisation in Egypt. This is also the situation that Alaa Abd El-Fattah is in, who has refused to be investigated by the military judicial system which he accuses of being biased. I too add my voice to those who have called in this Chamber for the release of Alaa Abd El-Fattah and all those like him.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We also call for the rights to a fair trial to be guaranteed, before a civilian court, in compliance with all the procedural rights. I believe that we need to monitor events more closely in Egypt to make sure that such abuses are going to stop.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, at the end of October, Cairo witnessed the death of 25 people as a result of the army’s response to a peaceful demonstration by Coptic Christians. The event is a tragic example among the numerous similar cases that we have also previously raised here.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In Egypt this year, 12 000 people have already been sentenced in a military court, rather than in a civilian one. The questionable arrest and imprisonment of the well-known Egyptian blogger, Abd El-Fattah, have made the news headlines in recent days. His decision to remain silent before the military court is a brave one, but his sole request is an independent, fair trial in a civil court. This should be everyone’s basic right.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The international attention that the case has attracted is at least timely. Egypt is going through an important time of change as far as democracy is concerned. The social media have played a major role in the events of the Arab Spring, including Egypt where the approaching elections will indicate the future direction. Once more, it will be the EU’s responsibility to demonstrate its commitment to standing up for democracy and freedom of religion and speech, and to support all those Egyptians who are striving to make their legal democratic aspirations a reality.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we also discussed the human rights situation in Egypt during the previous plenary. We are doing so again now. This point was also highlighted by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last week when she said that the reduction in the scope for freedom of expression and association in Egypt is extremely worrying. I too add my voice to those who have called for the immediate release of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a dissident blogger against the Mubarak regime who is currently in detention. He was detained and will be tried by a military court because he dared to criticise the actions of the security forces during the Maspero protests.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The lines written by Alaa Abd El-Fattah from cell 19 in Bab El-Khalek prison sum up very well, in my view, how absurd the situation is. I quote: ‘After Egypt’s revolution, I never expected to be back in Mubarak’s jail.’ Just as my colleagues have also requested, I believe that it must stop arresting and bringing detainees like him before military courts. This is certainly not democracy.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the blogger, Alaa Abd El-Fattah, was accused of calling for resistance against the armed forces during a demonstration. Against those who, right before his eyes, were killing unarmed people. He stood before a military court, even though he is not a soldier. He was imprisoned, while those who committed violence before his eyes and the eyes of the world remain free and unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In Slovakia, we know this scenario. To break up a peaceful demonstration in Bratislava in 1988, the communists used water cannon and police violence. Christians who demanded respect for fundamental rights were beaten, arrested and interrogated. Therefore, in the name of Christians and all citizens of Slovakia, we want the European Parliament to send a strong signal to Egypt today. We want the Egyptians to know that Europe demands that its partners respect fundamental human rights such as freedom of belief and religion and also freedom of speech. Without guarantees of these rights, a country without a dictator is the same as a country with a dictator.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the role of the social media in the events of the Arab Spring has been very important. The social media have helped report the course of events and disseminate information on the people’s demands for democracy. For example, we would not know about the events in Syria but for those brave individuals who put their own lives in danger when communicating information on what is happening in the country to the outside world.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Egypt is experiencing a dramatic change in its switch to democracy. It faces enormous challenges and difficulties along the way. While the blogger Maikel Nabil Sanad continues to sit in a prison cell, the blogger Abd El-Fattah is now at the mercy of an army prosecutor. No blogger or national activist exercising his or her freedom of speech should be harassed or imprisoned by the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Freedom of speech is one of the fundamental democratic pillars of society, and no one should be punished for exercising that freedom. That is why the European Union must show consistency: we must be prepared to help the Egyptian people, who are peacefully seeking a democratic future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we all regret that the Egyptian Spring has come to be so rapidly replaced with an autumn, that violation of human rights is already taking place over there, but I am most profoundly saddened by what is, regrettably, mass persecutions of Christians in Egypt and the indifference displayed by the Egyptian authorities toward this phenomenon. We often subject ourselves to a lot of criticism, approve of a lot of resolutions – should a minor incident occur that is targeting representatives of other religions in Europe. We must respond adequately to incomparably worse situations that Christians in various parts of the world come to face, especially in Egypt where persecution of this type is particularly fierce.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We condemn such persecution and must demand of the Egyptian authorities to take measures to protect Christians. Religious persecution spells barbarity and a country that would like to join the realm of civilisation should never tolerate anything of the kind.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, compared with regimes that blatantly violate human rights, it could be said that Alaa Abd El-Fattah’s situation is not so serious. However, Egypt wants to become a democracy. To do this, the basic principles need to be respected in every situation. In a proper democracy civilians are not brought before military courts. It may seem a minor point, but it is not. If such exceptions are accepted and treated lightly, they can pave the way to any abuse.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The military in Egypt have played an important role in replacing the Mubarak regime. However, now they have an even more important role: to respect their powers, thereby providing the foundations for a proper democracy. Shedding light on the violent incidents against the Coptic Christians is also an important aspect of this process.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have been a blogger for almost 10 years now and this is because I live in a country that freed itself from dictatorship, censorship and military tribunals in 1974. Our experience shows me that the most fundamental of the freedoms through which a genuine transition to democracy can be assessed is freedom of information and expression.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the interim military government in Egypt does not respect these fundamental freedoms, as highlighted by the cases of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaa_Abd_El-Fatah" and Maikel Nabil Sanad, and the more than 12 000 who have passed through the courts in the last few months, then we have every reason to fear that we are witnessing the wretched betrayal of those who have fought and died for democracy, justice and human rights in the various Tahrir Squares across Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We need to send out a very clear message on behalf of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and all the European authorities that we will not tolerate this, and that the European authorities and we in this House demand that human rights and basic freedoms be respected by the Egyptian authorities, and that those currently locked up be freed.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, in the spring of 1848, a wave of democracy swept over Europe, resulting in the recognition of human rights and demands for universal suffrage. I hope that the Arab Spring will not meet the same fate as the European Spring did in 1848 when the setback came and kings and dictators took back the power from the people.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is important that we bring up this particular case, but it is also a failure on our part that, in 1999, we decided to have a military force and a peace-keeping force, but we put all our effort into the military force. If we had built up the peace-keeping force with quarterly reports, judges, bureaucrats, police trainers, engineers and democracy engineers, we would have been in a position to help these countries when the Arab Spring arrived. It is high time that we sorted out the European peace-keeping force. That is how we can best help these countries now, so that they do not suffer the same failure that we did in 1848.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, every time this year when we have been discussing the situation in Egypt in a context of how common human rights violations are over there, back returns, indeed, again and again, the issue of that country’s persecuted Christians. Having said this, today we are talking about the blogger – a critic of abuses committed by the Egyptian authorities who, on his Internet page, voiced his protest against the army that routinely recurs to the use of force. These activities caused his detention – just like in many other cases.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Constitution of Egypt guarantees freedom of faith and freedom of practising one’s religion; however, the Supreme Military Command behaves as if none of these stipulations exist. The new Egyptian authorities have no regard for the rights of Christian minorities; they apprehend journalists, bloggers and representatives of various bodies and agencies who oppose events taking place in Egypt – and subject Christians to violent persecutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Egypt is involved in the European Neighbourhood programme; it is receiving considerable financial aid from the European Union. This is yet another reason why it is necessary to call upon the EU authorities to predicate further transfers of these resources on a considerable improvement of the situation in Egypt and to apply all available means of influencing the Supreme Military Command to ensure that persecutions of Copts are stopped – along with violations of human rights in Egypt. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Egypt is an important political factor in this region. In other words, a stable, democratic state would also help stabilise the region as a whole. Each country needs to navigate its own path to democracy. That is indeed the case. However, indivisible and essential human rights exist. These include freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the rule of law. These are essential factors and are not up for discussion.</p>
      <p sl="de">The release of illegal detainees, such as Alaa Abd El-Fattah, would represent an important political signal that Egypt is really serious about democracy. These are the yardsticks we should use to judge the country and I support the motion presented for a resolution. I would also ask that the European Commission should continuously strive to ensure that Egypt does not just pay lip service to democratic principles, but that it actually puts them into practice.</p>

      <p sl="de">The situation as it now stands is that the Arab Spring is over, but the democratic spring has yet to blossom. If we do not have a debate on religious freedom and human rights, if we do not have an agreed constitution that fulfils these principles before elections are held, then we will not be able to move forward boldly into the future. For this reason I wish to thank you for these resolutions. They will be an essential part of my luggage.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, respect for democratic values and human rights is a cornerstone in the relations between the European Union and its neighbours. Article 2 of the association agreement between the European Union and Egypt stipulates that the relations between the parties should be based on respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights. These include, of course, freedom of religion or belief, freedom of association, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission as a whole, I would like to emphasise that the broadening and reactivation of the Emergency Law in Egypt and its extension during the forthcoming elections are matters of concern, particularly in relation to respect for freedom of expression, the importance of a functioning civilian justice system and the right to be tried in accordance with international standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The need to ensure civil order is legitimate but it should be consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international instruments. That is our position. It should not hamper the spirit and expectations of the ‘25 January Revolution’ nor the aspiration of the Egyptian people for genuine and democratic elections. Unfortunately, the EU offer of election observation has been turned down by the Egyptian authorities: they consider international election observation as interference in domestic affairs. Nevertheless, the EU will provide election assistance through the training of several thousand domestic election monitors and capacity-building activities for the High Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Egyptian authorities must lift the Emergency Law as soon as possible. That is the High Representative’s position and the position of the Commission as a whole. Under the Emergency Law, detention is possible even without a trial. This provision has been applied to blogger Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who is accused of having incited violence against the armed forces and of having assaulted military personnel in front of the Maspero State TV building on 9 October 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Military trials of civilians deny the accused the full measure of the law available in civilian courts. Regrettably, the promise made on 15 September 2011 by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to stop referring civilians to military courts was not kept. The EU is constantly raising its concerns about the Emergency Law and the trial of civilians before military courts, including in the specific cases of Alaa Abd El-Fattah and Maikel Nabil Sanad. In this context, the EU has raised serious concerns about the possible interpretation of the exceptions under which the military trials may continue.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am particularly concerned at the information reaching us from Egypt. For several weeks now, many journalists, bloggers, civil society activists and human rights defenders have been intimidated, and even prosecuted, because of what they have written, declared or done. Having shown responsibility and courage during the peaceful demonstrations that led to President Hosni Mubarak standing down, they must be able freely to exercise the fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly, for which they revolted. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces must stop trying civilians before military courts, or else the democratic transition under way will be put in jeopardy. Looking ahead to the electoral process, which will last for several months, I therefore call on the Egyptian authorities to be responsible and enforce fundamental rights. The army must continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people, as it did during the revolution, and help build a new Egypt.</p>
