      <p sl="en">Madam President, on the occasion of World AIDS Day, I would like to congratulate the European Parliament for its resolution on the EU response to HIV/AIDS which you will adopt later today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully shares your concern and your commitment to improving the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS in Europe and beyond. The resolution is a strong and timely political signal underlining that, 30 years into the epidemic, HIV/AIDS still needs urgent attention. Last year alone, 25 000 people got infected in the EU and more than 100 000 new cases were reported in the Eastern Neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is committed to working towards universal access to prevention, treatment and care to support achieving the Millennium Development Goals targets by 2015. Let me reassure you that fighting HIV/AIDS remains high on the Commission’s agenda, following the adoption two years ago of our strategy and action plan on combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, the Commission has supported a number of initiatives in this field to help Member States and stakeholders across Europe through the Health Programme, the development programmes and bilateral agreements with third countries. Indeed, evidence-based prevention, access to testing, treatment and care, and fighting discrimination are the core elements of our response to HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also fostered mechanisms to coordinate HIV/AIDS policies and actions, such as the HIV/AIDS Think-Tank and the Civil Society Forum. Two years on, the overall Strategy and Action Plan to combat HIV/AIDS remains valid, and the Commission will report on its implementation early next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Especially in times of economic difficulties, we must not lose sight of HIV/AIDS. The Commission will continue to play its full and active role now and in the future. I take this opportunity to stress that HIV features prominently in the Commission proposal for a new Health Programme which Parliament will be debating soon.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, today is World Aids Day. Our Parliament felt that it was very important that we adopt this resolution in order to send a strong message.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although the AIDS epidemic is on the decline worldwide and is probably far less visible, we must not let our guard down: it remains a blight today. It affects over 12 million young people aged 15 to 25, including 500 000 in Europe, and so we need to rally all our political forces.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mr Dalli has just said, the European Commission adopted an action plan to combat HIV/AIDS for the period 2009-2013. A mid-term review is important because it will allow us to take stock and identify exactly what progress has been made. The reality is that over 50 000 new cases of HIV are diagnosed every year in the European Union and neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Within the Union, almost 30% of those who are HIV-positive do not know that they are infected – the figure is as high as 70% in several neighbouring countries. Consequently, this is a serious problem for political decision makers, which means us. Half of HIV-positive patients are still treated late, reaching advanced stages of infection before being diagnosed and starting treatment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, recent findings show that the risk of transmitting the virus to uninfected partners can be reduced by 96% if patients take retroviral drugs from the moment when HIV is diagnosed, rather than when their health begins to decline.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For this reason, it is imperative that the European Union maintain its commitment so as to avoid negating the progress and investments made thus far. We need to beef up prevention and training. We need to improve surveillance. We need to work tirelessly to create networks linking all the stakeholders working to combat this curse. We must also promote the dissemination of good practices and, among other things, make sure that simple yet effective tests are available for our citizens. If these tests become widely available, I think that it will be much easier for everyone to find out whether they are carrying the virus.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the challenge facing us. I feel that it is imperative that we remain vigilant and continue our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, World AIDS Day 2011 marks 30 years of the discovery of the first AIDS case in 1981. It is an opportunity for us to unite in the fight against HIV, to show our support for people living with HIV, and to commemorate those who have died. HIV/AIDS remains of major public health importance in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I am calling for the EU to implement the strategy on combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries. We need stronger action to reduce new infections, over 25 000 of which were recorded in 2009. An estimated 30% of people with HIV/AIDS are unaware they carry the virus. Therefore, we need to increase HIV testing amongst most-at-risk populations, such as young people, homosexual men, injecting drug users, sex workers and prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Between 2007 and 2010, a new HIV testing programme in the US was carried out aimed at hard-to-reach groups and high-risk populations. Testing took place in a range of settings: emergency departments, STI clinics, substance abuse clinics and community-based organisations. Whilst most testing was carried out in clinical settings, conducted by community-based organisations as part of the programme, it yielded a disproportionate number of new diagnoses, indicating the importance of supporting community-based organisations to improve rates of HIV diagnosis. We must guarantee access to HIV prevention, counselling, testing and early care, and, most of all, support a community-based approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also calling for more action to tackle stigma and discrimination. People living with HIV/AIDS should be included in all equality and anti-discriminatory legislation. A 2010 UNAIDS survey reported that those living with HIV experienced high levels of negative attitudes and behaviours, as well as employment discrimination, including loss of work. Exclusion from family activities was reported by more than 40% of respondents. We must remember that the enemy is HIV, not HIV carriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should also provide a policy framework to encourage national governments to address the issue of HIV/AIDS in the context of sexual health strategies. We need adequate information and sex education, access to protection means, such as male and female condoms, and strengthening the rights of women in sexual relationships. In an Irish context, I regret we still have not developed a national sexual health strategy. Of course, the active participation and involvement of people living with HIV at all levels of the national and international response is crucial to the success of all our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I wish to thank my fellow co-sponsors on this question, and especially my colleague, Michael Cashman, who has worked so hard on this issue for so long.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, almost three years after the launch of the EU strategy on combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries, we must admit that, even within the European Union, we are far from reaching the objective of this year’s World AIDS Day of ‘Getting to Zero’, which refers to zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.</p>
      <p sl="de">Progress still needs to be made, whether in prevention, early diagnosis or timely access to treatment. The situation within our Union is even more worrying in certain regions, notably Eastern Europe, while at the same time, the disease tends to be forgotten in the minds of people and policy makers. Thirty years after the first detection of AIDS, it is still crucial to underline the importance of greater awareness-raising and information, the need for strengthened and targeted prevention policies and the need for governments in the EU to remain committed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, we welcome the Commission’s commitment and continuous effort in implementing its strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, but we hope that you will make clear to Member States that having a strategy just on paper is not enough. Even during a time of crisis, national AIDS programmes need to be effectively financed and implemented. Let us also look at the reality and focus on the right priorities. There is no room for taboo or forbidden topics. It is crucial that Member States ensure that all national AIDS programmes and strategies develop strong linkages between sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, let me say a word about the resolution that we will be voting on today and which has been broadly supported by all groups within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Yes, there are vulnerable groups that are more at risk, notably young people, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users, which deserve all our attention and for which targeted strategies should be developed and reinforced. These groups become more vulnerable when subjected to social exclusion, stigmatisation and discrimination, from which people living with HIV are too often suffering. It is certainly not by denying the existence of these groups or by refusing to speak about anti-discrimination campaigns that we will succeed in our continuous fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore hope that all Members of this House will abstain from ideological consideration and will support the resolution as a whole. Today is World AIDS Day, an occasion to recall and maintain our consistent and unambiguous commitment in combating HIV/AIDS in Europe and beyond.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, yes it is true that we need more money in the European budget to have programmes to educate about HIV/AIDS and to monitor it. But I wish to ask Ms Parvanova if she agrees with me that Member States are neglecting that disease and that we have different amounts of money spent in Member States – which is a shame, as we heard from Ms Childers – and that it would be necessary to ask the Commission to ask the Member States to show us how much money they spend on education programmes, how much money they spend on treating the disease, on hospices and on helping to eradicate this disease?</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be good if we could ask the new Presidency, the Danish Presidency, to deliver those numbers as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I agree absolutely with Mrs Roth-Behrendt. It is crucial that we use all the available means and political tools to implement our strategy, but also that we make it a reality and make it work.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to use the opportunities presented by e-health, innovation and partnership, ICT enhancement, and health technology and assessment. All this together will help us actually deliver because – as I said at the beginning – we have failed. It is crucially important to have transparency on the flows of money dedicated to certain priorities and to see what the added value is of that money, those priorities and this decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in this House have been aware of all the lobbying for different priorities which are not important for society or for European citizens, but which are important for certain groups of lobbyists. So let us now do something on behalf of, and to the benefit of, our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today we remember with great sadness the many thousands of innocent lives claimed by this terrible wasteful disease. Shocking statistics show that there is still no decrease in the number of new infections within the EU. That is not good enough. HIV is an epidemic that affects all Member States and we have a great responsibility to those living with HIV and AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="en">Later today, I hope that Parliament will adopt the resolution on the EU’s global response to HIV and AIDS. The resolution looks at all aspects of the EU’s contribution to fighting HIV and AIDS, including funding for research to find a vaccine. We need to deal with a disease which knows no borders, no race, no age and no gender. However, this is a disease we can control, especially through testing, and I am confident that one day we will find a cure. For now, we have to raise public awareness in this battle, support civil groups in their work and continue sharing research. I am happy to say this resolution goes a long way towards these aims.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ECR Group joins with all those across the globe in memory of friends, relatives and loved ones who have died as a result of contracting AIDS. We stand fully behind the drive to beat HIV and AIDS and to improve the lives of all those who live with it, and we reaffirm our commitment to this fight.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks go to all those involved in drafting this resolution. Our common objective is to reduce the number of HIV infections, for statistics do not support the notion that this is what is happening.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the EU countries, tens of thousands of new cases are confirmed every year, and if we include our neighbouring countries, the number of new cases a year is in excess of 100 000. However, this is a disease that is completely preventable, and we know how to do this. The main reason why everything that can be done to prevent new HIV infections is not being done is hypocrisy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A few years ago, I was in South Africa and I happened to see a television advertisement in which Nelson Mandela said that we speak to our children about sex because we love them. Mandela was obviously referring to the fact that young people and people in general could protect themselves from HIV. They need to know about sex and they need to know, for example, that a condom will protect them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The experience of my own country, Finland, is that sex education in schools and the open debate generally on sex, together with comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, are an effective way to reduce the number of problems relating to sexual behaviour, from abortions to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. That is why sexual and reproductive health services are so vitally important.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Many Members have already referred to the position of women. Statistics show that 45% of those newly infected are young women under the age of 25. This clearly shows that the issue also concerns gender roles and whether women have the knowledge and courage to insist on the use of a condom in their sexual relations. Testing obviously plays a crucial part in the prevention of new infections, because people who are not aware that they are infected are three times more likely to spread the disease. Similarly, treatment is crucially important, for example, in preventing the infection from being passed on from breastfeeding or expectant mothers to their children, and the prevention of discrimination is important from the perspective of treatment, as some Members have already mentioned. I hope that we can add to our general objectives and set concrete goals, as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has done.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we are here today, all united around a resolution that makes a series of demands that are very important in terms of intervention. We are talking about World AIDS/HIV Day, and this evaluation of the resolution and communication of 2009 is crucial. It is crucial precisely because of things that have already been mentioned. We are repeating ourselves because, unfortunately, there is still room for repetition, which means a lot remains to be done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are many new cases diagnosed every year in Europe and in the European Economic Area: the 2010 report talks about more than 25 000 new cases. If we take into account neighbouring countries, we are talking about over 100 000 new cases. Moreover, if we think that some things are as bad as they can be, they can always get worse.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One of the issues that I would like to make very clear here has to do with the divestment that has been taking place in the health care sector because of the economic and financial crisis that we are currently experiencing. This divestment has been having a very serious effect on areas crucial to combating HIV/AIDS. Therefore, Commissioner, I think that the Commission has a key role here in calling on the Member States to meet their obligations in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A second issue has to do with the increased discrimination that the economic and social crisis has also brought to light; discrimination against workers who have lost their jobs because they are carriers of this virus. That is why prevention, treatment and care should be the same for everyone, regardless of sex or age, and regardless of the region in which they live. I hope we will be able to implement these measures with your support, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the EU response to HIV infection, which we have played an active part in drafting and signed, calls attention to the extraordinarily high number of infections affecting European citizens each year. In particular, it draws attention to the fact that 30% of HIV-positive people are co-infected with hepatitis C.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union must implement policies informing of the risks that people run in becoming infected with a disease, which, in addition to being debilitating, often causes the death of sufferers. Unfortunately, owing to an amendment passed by a majority in committee, the original text has been changed to include a sentence on abortion with which we do not agree, as it has nothing to do with the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have specifically requested a separate vote on the change introduced by the amendment on abortion in order to delete it, in the hope that the original text, which we support, is upheld. Should this not be the case, whilst we believe that this resolution is important for European citizens and for young people in particular, we will be unable to vote in favour and will have to abstain.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the number of people living with HIV in the United Kingdom has hit an estimated 91 500 in 2010, which is an increase of 5 000 on the previous year. This figure is predicted to reach 100 000 by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, more people than ever are living with HIV, with an average of two people per week being newly diagnosed as HIV positive. While that number remains relatively low, figures released this week show a rise of 20%, with the majority of new cases being diagnosed among men.</p>
      <p sl="en">In light of these figures and the World Health Organisation’s confirmation that 33.4 million people worldwide live with HIV, including 2.1 million children, it is my belief that education throughout Member States is vital for prevention, which, alongside early diagnosis and access to treatment, can play an essential part in limiting the spread of HIV. It is time to eradicate people’s fear of being tested for the HIV virus. Due to the stigma and fear attached to an HIV-positive diagnosis, people are coming forward for testing after the point at which treatment for their infection should have begun, which greatly worsens their prognosis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The advances in HIV treatment in the last 30 years since the virus emerged have been massive, but too many people still test late and fail to benefit.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the representative of the Polish Presidency, I have the honour of presenting the position of the European Union and the Member States on the occasion of World AIDS Day, as agreed with the European Commission and then adopted by the Council on 28 November 2011.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, on World AIDS Day 2011, when we are marking the fight against AIDS, the European Union and the Member States are joining people around the world in commemorating relatives, friends and loved ones lost to AIDS, and reiterating their commitment to supporting all people living with HIV and those affected by the AIDS epidemic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This year, we are celebrating a special anniversary: it was exactly 30 years ago that the world learned about HIV and AIDS. In December 1981, the first cases of AIDS were discovered. During these 30 years of struggle and sacrifice for millions of people, over 30 million people have lost their lives and 16 million children have been orphaned due to AIDS. HIV and AIDS have affected every country and many communities and families. It is estimated that there are currently 33.3 million people living with HIV worldwide, and that each day, 7 000 people are infected with AIDS, mainly in low and medium-income countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The last 30 years have also been a time of engagement and partnership to a hitherto unseen extent. The fight against HIV has taught us the significance of partnership and dialogue, and we have learned that human rights and human dignity should always be in the spotlight. Impressive progress has led to a decrease of nearly 20% in the number of new HIV infections worldwide in the last decade, and to a decrease of almost 19% in the number of AIDS-related deaths in the years 2004-2009. The greatest progress has been made in the area most affected, that is, in the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, home to two thirds of all people infected with HIV.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union is proud of the fact that the efforts it has undertaken, together with key partners such as UNAIDS, the WHO, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, people living with HIV and civil society, have helped to achieve remarkable advances in the global fight against HIV and AIDS. In 2010, the European Union’s contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria amounted to nearly USD 1.5 billion, which represents 53% of total contributions to this fund (taking into account total contributions from the European Commission and the Member States).</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nevertheless, more than 8 million people living in low and medium-income countries still need access to effective treatment, and the number of new infections still exceeds the number of people entering therapy. This means that HIV and AIDS are still one of the biggest barriers these countries face on their road towards development. In seven countries, including five countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the number of HIV infections increased by more than 25% between 2001 and 2009. Through partnerships with these countries, the European Union will intensify its efforts to change this intolerable situation, calling for the urgent stepping up of prevention programmes and services at regional and national level, which may help to eradicate HIV and AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union will play a decisive role in the fight against HIV and AIDS by strengthening its leading position, and by better adapting the activities of the institutions of the European Union to the changing context as regards HIV at global and European level. The challenge for us now is to retain AIDS as a priority and to accelerate actions taken at global, regional, national and local level in order to end this epidemic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union welcomes the comprehensive review of progress made in terms of meeting the obligations arising from all the Millennium Development Goals of the year 2000, and the ambitious targets for 2015 as set out in the political declaration on HIV/AIDS entitled ‘Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV/AIDS’, adopted at the high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on AIDS in June 2011. Achieving these objectives will bring us closer to a world with no new HIV infections, no AIDS-related deaths and no discrimination. The European Union joins the community of people taking action against the AIDS epidemic by supporting the UNAIDS strategy: zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero HIV/AIDS-related deaths – ‘Getting to zero’ – and, on the occasion of World AIDS Day, it confirms its willingness to participate in achieving the joint task of defeating the HIV epidemic. We reaffirm the commitment of the European Union to working towards the 2015 targets, which include the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in 15 million people infected with HIV, a halving of the number of sexually transmitted infections, a halving of the number of HIV infections among intravenous drug users, the elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission and a significant reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union stresses that prevention is the most effective way to halt the HIV epidemic. We need to ensure that preventive strategies are comprehensive, and are developed on the basis of available knowledge with full respect for human rights and understanding of the local context, making the fullest possible use of existing methods of prevention and, at the same time, promoting new methods and technologies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union notes with concern the fact that women and girls are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection due to physiological, economic and social factors, inequalities and gender-related violence. Women and girls constitute more than 50% of all people living with HIV, and HIV and AIDS remain the most important cause of morbidity and mortality for women of child-bearing age. The European Union will therefore step up its activities to promote an approach which takes into account issues relating to gender, gender equality and the empowerment of women, as well as actions to promote women’s rights, in particular, the right to protect themselves against hazardous sexual behaviour, especially in the context of combating human trafficking and all forms of sexual exploitation. At the same time, attention should be paid to promoting responsible behaviour, especially among men.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union draws particular attention to populations most at risk of infection, including men who have sexual relations with men, intravenous drug users, migrants, prisoners, ethnic minorities, persons providing paid sexual services and their clients. These populations are often marginalised and it can be difficult to reach out to them, which increases their vulnerability to HIV infection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, we note with concern that most young people still have only limited access to programmes on sexual and reproductive health, providing information, skills, services and social support. It is vital to ensure wide access to specially designed prevention programmes and services, including confidential HIV testing and counselling, high-quality male and female condoms at affordable prices, comprehensive sex education, harm reduction programmes and other available prevention measures. While planning effective HIV prevention and care, one should not forget about the prevention and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are calling for closer cooperation in this area, and the inclusion of HIV and AIDS programmes in basic health care, including programmes on sexual and reproductive health, and a strengthening of programmes and services related to the prevention and treatment of all these diseases.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union recognises the need for greater involvement of people living with HIV or AIDS in all aspects of the planning, implementation and monitoring of prevention and support policies, strategies and programmes. We are aware of the crucial role played by non-governmental organisations, including organisations which bring together people and groups affected by HIV to support national and local actions in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union welcomes the substantial increase in the availability of antiretroviral treatment. However, it notes with concern the differences in availability from region to region. Currently, more than 6.5 million people in low and medium-income countries are receiving antiretroviral treatment. However, there are still 8 million people who are eligible for medical treatment but who are deprived of the opportunity to receive such treatment. The results of recent research on the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs have opened up more opportunities for HIV prevention and make it possible to fight the epidemic more effectively. We wish to emphasise our commitment to universal access to antiretroviral treatment, care and support for people living with HIV or AIDS, and the importance of involvement and investment at national level, taking into account respect for the dignity, rights and freedoms of HIV-infected persons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union welcomes the significant decrease in the number of new mother-to-child transmitted HIV infections. We reaffirm our commitment to actions aimed at universal access to the prevention of vertical infections in order to eliminate HIV infections among children and to save the lives of their mothers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union reaffirms that all persons living with HIV or AIDS, in particular, children and young people, should be able to benefit from the best available methods of care, treatment and support. Once again, we emphasise the need to integrate issues relating to HIV/AIDS and reproductive and sexual health rights into strategies and programmes at local, national, regional and international level. The Member States should protect persons living with HIV or AIDS against discrimination, stigmatisation and deprivation of their rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The EU also confirms its commitment to, and support for, the abolition of restrictions on the right of entry and short- and long-term residence for people living with HIV, and the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the elimination of laws punishing it, since such legislation neither provides appropriate tools to fight the epidemic nor supports populations particularly vulnerable to infection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union acknowledges that in times of economic crisis, the appropriate allocation of available resources, including health promotion and preventive actions, is a key issue. We therefore reiterate our firm commitment to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of programmes and services that have already been implemented, and to strengthening national health care systems and the human resources necessary to provide health care, education and social services, which are critical for the prevention and treatment of HIV infections and care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS and their support. Only by continuing our work and stepping up high-quality and effective measures, and by remedying existing shortcomings in all regards, will the European Union as a whole, and each of its Member States individually, be able to contribute significantly to reducing the number of new infections, instances of stigmatisation and discrimination and AIDS-related deaths.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, I would like to thank all those who participated in this discussion for the powerful message that is being put across in order to go on battling HIV/AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This strong message has become increasingly important nowadays, due to the austerity measures that Europe is undergoing, which call for a reduction of many of the resources that were being allocated to the health sector. Our message today needs to focus on budget cuts in our countries that tackle the squandering of money and not the reduction of funds for programmes such as HIV/AIDS, especially in light of the considerable investment required for its prevention.</p>
      <p sl="mt">These last few years have witnessed substantial progress in the battle against this illness. However, we are still nowhere near to fulfilling our main objective of a zero figure in terms of new infections, zero deaths due to AIDS, and zero discrimination. Nonetheless, I can guarantee full commitment on the part of the Commission in its determination to go on working relentlessly in order to achieve these goals. We must keep up our fight against discrimination, which is a great scourge among many European countries, and ensure access to care for all those who are infected or in danger of becoming infected by this illness, both within Europe and outside it. However, as some of you have also said, a more vigorous effort is required in educating our people, our citizens, on everything that has to do with HIV/AIDS infection.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I augur a steady continuation of all our efforts in this regard. On the part of the Commission, we are conducting a platform, a so called think-tank against AIDS/HIV which is made up of Member State, where we try to promote best practices amongst each Member State to the best of our ability, in order to ensure better coordinated action and, in turn, to yield better results.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At a time when the number of people infected with HIV has risen both in Europe (2.2 million people according to the 2009 data) and globally (34 million people infected with HIV, marking a 17% rise on the level a decade ago), it is time for the European executive to conduct a major analysis of its own action strategy for preventing the number of people affected by this disease from increasing. The statistics currently available indicate that this rise in the number of patients results from two different trends: the continuing increase in the number of people infected with HIV and the rise in the life expectancy of people with this disease, as a result of the discovery of new treatments and drugs. In these circumstances, the European executive must look at the directions of the strategic action for preventing the spread of the HIV infection, with the aim of making social and health policies applied at this level more effective, as well as at the policies for investment in research, prevention, treatment and support for patients, with the aim of spreading good practices and European models.</p>

      <p sl="en">Today reminds us that the numbers are terrible: 30 years – 60 million HIV infections, 30 million deaths. What is even worse is that we are talking about a fully preventable disease, but with a growing number of infections! The targets are ambitious; the spread of HIV/AIDS should be reversed by 2015. But how do we get there? I would like to emphasise three points. First, prevention. Equitable, universal access to prevention is necessary, together with adequate information, sex education and access to means of protection. Of course, when it comes to prevention, we shall mention vaccination as well which has already helped to lower and then freeze the number of new HIV infections to 2.7 million per year. Second, anti-discrimination. We should make sure that people suffering from HIV/AIDS are not discriminated and not stigmatised. Third, the gender aspect. We should bear in mind that women are more vulnerable than men in getting affected. This again shows the importance of, and the need for, ensuring women’s rights and autonomy. All this requires serious, long-term political and financial engagement and support.</p>

      <p sl="en">I stand behind this resolution and the effort to bring Member States together in order to address serious issues, such as the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in the EU and nearby nations. This report accurately points out that disease knows no borders. In the same way, we as members of the EU need to look past our national differences in order to make a positive impact on Europe as a whole. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in EU Member States as well as surrounding nations is a serious matter, with over 2.2 million people in the European region suffering from the disease. Together, we can fight this life-threatening disease and help alleviate the harm it causes to those who suffer from it. I propose that in order to truly fight the ongoing epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Europe, we focus on not only treatment but also disease prevention. It is important for the EU to work together, pool research and resources, and then to branch out in order to meet specific needs of various nations and regions. Only through these united efforts can we seriously combat the danger that HIV/AIDS presents to our society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It has become necessary to review the plan to combat HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries for the period 2009-2013 due to rapid progress in research on the nature of this disease and methods of treatment. In May 2011, a new antiviral drug was registered. It is essential to revise the objectives of further research, as well as the arrangements for funding and the level of such funding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As in any field, the most effective approach is prevention. Since HIV does not produce any symptoms for a long period (about 10 years on average), systematic prophylactic tests are necessary. We also need effective information and educational campaigns. Their targets should primarily be the high-risk groups. In Poland, for example, about 50% of HIV infections are in people between 20 and 29 years of age.</p>
      <p sl="pl">HIV-infected patients and those suffering from AIDS face not only the disease itself, but also discrimination and stigmatisation, and often also a lack of financial resources for treatment. Intolerance makes it more difficult to find work, the result of which is poverty, and which, in turn, increases the risk of the disease spreading, thus closing the vicious circle. As Nelson Mandela once said, ‘The killer is not AIDS. Stigma, discrimination and ostracism are the real killers’. On the occasion of World AIDS Day, held on 1 December, I hereby appeal for understanding and institutional support for all those suffering from the disease.</p>

      <p sl="en">With today being World Aids day, it is quite fitting that the Parliament should vote on the motion for resolution on the EU’s global response to HIV/AIDS. Despite efforts having been made to reduce the number of new infections within the EU and neighbouring countries, progress on the 2009 Commission strategy, which aimed at doing this, has been unsatisfactory. I am quite alarmed that an estimate for the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has revealed that around 30% of HIV-positive people are still not diagnosed. Furthermore, these undiagnosed patients have three and a half times higher risk of transmitting HIV than those who have been diagnosed. What’s more, those that have been diagnosed with HIV are still presenting themselves late for care and, consequently, progress to late stages of infection before they are diagnosed and can start treatment. It is therefore imperative that there are better resources allocated to ensure fair access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment support and medical research, along with continuing implementing measures to address the continued discrimination and stigma attached to those infected with HIV. It is therefore only right that I voted in favour of this motion for resolution.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I would like to warmly welcome the new President of the European Central Bank, Mr Mario Draghi, and on behalf of all of us in the European Parliament, wish him every success in his very difficult task.</p>
    </intervention>

      <p sl="it">President Draghi, may I welcome you to this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, I want to thank the shadows, assistants and advisers for their very good collaboration on this report. Today, we shall discuss the ECB report which was largely approved in the ECON committee last month. On debt crisis management, I welcome the ECB’s interventions in the markets. If necessary, I encourage them to continue these in the next weeks. These interventions have saved the euro; without them, the situation now would be worse.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also deplore the hesitation in management of the crisis by the European Commission and by Member States, particularly those countries lacking reforms, as that has often pushed the ECB to act. We also express worries in the report about the limits of ECB interventions; monetary policy cannot solve every problem. Every country is responsible for its own fiscal situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot ignore that there is a growing exposure to risky assets in the ECB balance sheet. The ECB is right now a lender of last resort. For the banking sector, the ECB has been a lender of last resort since May 2010. There has been an unlimited credit flow from the ECB to eurozone banks. Those banks have been buying huge amounts of public debt from eurozone governments. This massive ECB help may have taken away, or delayed, incentives to carry out reforms in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the report, we voted to reinforce economic governance. I believe that fiscal discipline is a precondition for more European integration. I think that national and regional budgets should be supervised at the European level. The report we voted on also shares Mr Trichet’s opinion regarding the need for a European Minister of Finance to coordinate a basic common fiscal policy and to enhance the effectiveness of the euro. This debt crisis shows that in a monetary union, fiscal policy cannot be exclusively left to Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report we adopted also stresses the need for a European Treasury to relieve the ECB of its quasi-fiscal role. Until then, we suggest entrusting more tasks to the European Stability Mechanism. Mr Draghi, I would welcome your views on these proposals.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, concerning transparency, I call for the publication of the minutes of the Governing Council meetings, as is the case with the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of Sweden. I consider non-publication a sign of weakness of the monetary union. We need public and individual accountability in the decision-making processes. With this in mind, we will vote today for the publication of the summary of Governing Council meetings. We hope that the ECB will listen to the democratic voice of this Chamber in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am delighted to be making my first appearance here as President of the ECB and I am honoured to present to you the ECB Annual Report for 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first thing I wish to do is pay homage to my predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet. During all his tenure, he had a very fruitful and very constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and I intend to continue on this route with the same force, the same strength that he displayed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s session is an opportunity for us to take a wider perspective on ECB policies. In that way, I will also touch on a number of the broader themes of the resolution of the European Parliament. Let me begin with a few words on the main monetary policy decisions we have taken and the challenges we have faced during 2010 and 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the ECB’s monetary policy is constantly guided by the goal of maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. And when I say this, I mean price stability in either direction. This applies to both the setting of official interest rates and the implementation of non-standard measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">This autumn, tensions in financial markets have intensified again with very adverse effects on financing conditions and confidence. Downside risks to the economic outlook have increased. The weaker degree of activity is itself moderating price, cost and wage pressures. It is in this context that the ECB decided to reduce its key interest rates by 25 basis points in early November 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dysfunctional government bond markets in several euro area countries hamper the single monetary policy because the way this policy is transmitted to the real economy depends also on the conditions of the bond markets in the various countries. An impaired transmission mechanism for monetary policy has a damaging effect on the availability and price of credit to firms and households.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the very important monetary policy reason for the ECB’s non-standard measures. But of course, such interventions can only be limited. Governments must – individually and collectively – restore their credibility vis-à-vis financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tensions in sovereign bond markets have been accompanied by stress in the banking sector given the financial interlinkages between governments and banks. The ECB has taken several measures in 2010 and 2011 to ensure that banks continue to have access to funding sources. This has enabled them to continue lending to firms and households.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, the ECB has extended its policy of fully allotting liquidity demanded by banks at fixed rates against collateral. The maximum maturity of these liquidity-providing operations was first extended to six months and then later to 12 and 13 months. A new Covered Bond Purchase Programme has recently been initiated, with a size of EUR 40 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, liquidity in US dollars has been offered to banks for three-month periods. Yesterday, in a globally coordinated action with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank, we have agreed to lower the price on US dollar provision in other constituencies, including the euro area. We have furthermore agreed, as a contingency measure, to establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements so that liquidity can be provided in each jurisdiction in any of the currencies, should market conditions so warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the ECB’s Governing Council meets on Thursday next week, we are now in the pre-decision period, and nothing that I say should in any way be interpreted in terms of future monetary policy decisions. But as far as the current situation is concerned, there is frankly not much more to say beyond what I have said in recent statements.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware of the continuing difficulties for banks due to the stress on sovereign bonds, the tightness of funding markets and the scarcity of eligible collateral in some financial segments. We are also aware of the problems of maturity mismatches on balance sheets, the challenges of raising levels of capital and the cyclical risks related to the downturn.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the overall functioning of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union. Looking back at 2010 and 2011, notable progress has been achieved in reinforcing economic governance – though I recognise that this may not be evident in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament has contributed decisively to that progress, and the ECB commends its work. The ‘six-pack’, the European Semester, the Euro Plus Pact: all these initiatives have set the stage for closer coordination and more intensive scrutiny of economic policies in the EU, particularly in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet we are at a difficult stage at present. We have set up these new mechanisms, but their positive effects on the credibility of government fiscal policies are not yet visible. And the government changes that have taken place in some of the more exposed countries have not yet had much of an effect on the continuing fragility of financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fundamental questions are being raised and they call for an answer. At the heart of these questions are not only the credibility of governments’ policies and the actual delivery of the promised reforms, but also the overall design of our common fiscal governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am confident that the new surveillance framework will restore confidence over time. I am also quite sure that countries overall are on the right track. But a credible signal is needed to give ultimate assurance over the short term.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I believe our economic and monetary union needs is a new fiscal compact – a fundamental restatement of the fiscal rules together with the mutual fiscal commitments that euro area governments have made.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just as we effectively have a compact that describes the essence of monetary policy – an independent central bank with a single objective of maintaining price stability – so a fiscal compact would enshrine the essence of fiscal rules and the government commitments taken so far, and ensure that the latter become fully credible, individually and collectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">We might be asked whether a new fiscal compact would be enough to stabilise markets and how a credible longer-term vision can be helpful in the short term. Our answer is that it is definitely the most important element to start restoring credibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other elements might follow, but the sequencing matters. And it is, first and foremost, important to get a commonly shared fiscal compact right. Confidence works backwards: if there is an anchor in the long term, it is easier to maintain trust in the short term. After all, investors are themselves often taking decisions with a long-term horizon, especially with regard to government bonds.</p>
      <p sl="en">A new fiscal compact would be the most important signal from euro area governments for embarking on a path of comprehensive deepening of economic integration. It would also present a clear trajectory for the future evolution of the euro area, thus framing expectations.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the precise legal process that brings about a move towards a genuine economic union, we should keep our options open. Far-reaching Treaty changes should not be discarded, but faster processes are also conceivable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whatever the approach, companies, markets and the citizens of Europe expect policy makers to act decisively to resolve the crisis. It is time to adapt the euro area design with a set of institutions, rules and processes that is commensurate with the requirements of monetary union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and welcome Mr Draghi on his first appearance here. I also want to welcome what he said about Treaty changes and the need for faster responses. In addition, I welcome the ECB support for liquidity across the European Union, without which we would not have been able to survive so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are really serious questions facing us at this perilous crossroads in European history. The issue of eurobonds and the need for a lender of last resort is high on the agenda, whether that lender is the European Central Bank or the EFSF or some other mechanism. The hour has arrived and we cannot dither any longer. This is the difficulty that we face and, if we do require Treaty change, then let us go ahead on some pro forma basis on the presumption that that Treaty change will be approved by Member States retrospectively. If it works, they will pass it, but passing Treaty changes takes time. In some countries, we may even need a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe we do not have that time. It may be said that there is a strict legal requirement, but this is like saying that we cannot turn the Titanic right or left because the traffic light does not permit it. Let it trundle on, crash and we will then put the lifeboats out and pick up whoever is left. The European project, and the euro in particular, cannot be allowed to go the same route as the Titanic.</p>
      <p sl="en">In natural justice, which, in my belief, precedes written law, our leaders must act now. We are in peril. This is not a job for politicians. It is a job for statesmen and stateswomen. I hope that we will rise to the occasion. I think we should all be asked to read and re-read the speech that the Polish Foreign Minister made in Germany very recently. I think what he has to say is really imperative for all of us to understand and to know to secure the future of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, allow me to welcome President Draghi to the European Parliament. I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr Tremosa, for his excellent cooperation on this dossier.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Against the current backdrop of financial instability, the European Central Bank has, in practical terms, a fundamental role to play. However, as I see it, the actions taken by this institution to address the turbulent conditions evident on the financial markets are still inadequate. However, the bank’s independence must be preserved, and it must become, in practical terms, as you stated, a lender of last resort for the euro area countries, taking action to tackle speculation and the deterioration in the crisis situation. At a practical level, if the bank assumed its role as a central bank, this would help significantly to boost confidence in the robustness of the euro area’s architecture.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, a beefed-up role for the European Central Bank must be supplemented by radical measures, so to speak, such as issuing common euro area bonds, harmonising Member States’ taxation systems and strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility. In this regard, I support the proposal tabled by the Commission on 23 November for issuing common euro area bonds. I believe that Member States must realise that these bonds have to be issued to ensure the financial markets’ stability and that each of them stands to gain from a solution based on solidarity. This would, at a practical level, reduce the overall cost of the debt and would ensure the European financial markets’ liquidity. I would like to make one more, final point, which I personally believe: the European currency cannot function without fiscal union which will, in practical terms, complete monetary union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Draghi, we are delighted to see you again today. I have to say that I would have liked a few more Members to have been in plenary to pay tribute to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me start with a point on the independence of the European Central Bank (ECB). I think it is very good that this has been stressed unambiguously by Ms Merkel, Mr Monti and Mr Sarkozy. It is also a concept very dear to the European Parliament. Of course, the principle of independence means even greater responsibility for you personally, together with the members of the Executive Board and the Governing Council, but we trust you to take the right decisions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, all the current speculation surrounding what the ECB could or should do, but also, I should say, regarding your internal organisation, seems to me to be detrimental to the euro and the independence of the Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to highlight another issue: communication. It is only natural that there should be a discussion – and in view of the magnitude of the issues, a lively discussion – between the members of the Governing Council. Yet once the decisions have been taken, I personally would like a team spirit to prevail, whereby decisions are defended in the European general interest, which takes precedence over all national considerations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I share Parliament’s desire for greater transparency, but at the moment, the problem is not publishing the minutes, but rather preventing certain individuals from making claims in their national media that do not necessarily correspond to what has been decided collectively.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is often said that politicians talk too much. It is often said that women talk too much. I suspect that some male technocrats need to learn to hold their tongues. You yourself have been tactful in your communications, and we honour you for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me stress that we have a single Treaty, a single currency and probably have a shared interest in discipline. I hope, Mr President, that you find the same desire for discipline and compliance in your own house when it comes to defending the unity of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the rest, we wish you well. We are counting on you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate President Draghi on his new role and wish him well in these turbulent times.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the debate currently raging between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy and others concerning the future role of the ECB needs mentioning. Above all else, the independence of the ECB needs to be upheld, particularly in times of crisis. Credibility is key. If eurozone members want the ECB to act as the lender of last resort, they should legitimise this role as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ECB should not be a political football for point scoring between national politicians. Perhaps, as well as looking at the measures other institutions should or should not be taking, Member States themselves should be looking to get their own houses in order. I include eurozone and non-eurozone members in this plea. We passed the ‘six-pack’ on economic governance two plenary sessions ago. Member States should be looking to implement it as soon as they can, introducing credible and robust measures suited to their own countries to bring their budget deficits back down to acceptable levels. Credibility really is key.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Mr Draghi, the statutory role of the European Central Bank, to maintain price stability without heed for the repercussions on the real economy, has proven to be catastrophic under the present circumstances. The ECB annual report for 2010 emphasises as much. I propose that the role of the European Central Bank should be changed.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, in 2010, the European Central Bank hid behind inflation and, as a result: firstly, it failed to halt rocketing spreads; secondly, it failed to halt action by the speculation mafia in credit rating agencies, which it has incorporated into its charter; thirdly, it kept interest rates high – you, Mr Draghi, reduced them somewhat recently – in a period of recession, higher than in the United States and higher than in Great Britain.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, the independence of the European Central Bank is a very moot point. Independent bankers are being ‘canonised’ to the point of being made prime ministers, as we have seen in two countries. Consequently, the European Central Bank is being politically manipulated. Political parliamentary control of the European Central Bank needs to change.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to welcome the President of the Bank and to thank him for turning up, even if nobody else has. I have read this report, unlike most of my colleagues probably: power to suspend credit ratings, a European Monetary Fund to exclude the IMF, a single European Treasury issuing eurobonds and a single European Finance Minister, all of which, of course, would be unelected. It is a manifesto for European economic dictatorship, which is why I rather suspect the British Conservative Party will welcome it with open arms. If they do not vote for it, they will abstain in a marked manner, as they usually do, and talk a good story back in London.</p>
      <p sl="en">The President of the Bank reminds me a little bit of the poem by Siegfried Sassoon, the great war poet: ‘He’s a cheery old card’ said Harry to Jack, ‘As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack, But he did for them both with his plan of attack’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Central Bank (ECB) is solely responsible for the stability of the monetary value of the euro. As we are all aware, its main task is to keep inflation under control within the monetary union. With its intervention in the bond markets, which began in May 2010 and have so far involved more than EUR 200 billion being spent on government bonds from heavily indebted euro countries, the ECB has definitely exceeded its mandate. The ECB may see its purchases as being an important means of stabilising the capital markets but, in fact, by entering the grey area between fiscal and monetary policy, the ECB has not in any way reduced the interest burden on the euro crisis countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once its credibility has been lost, the resulting costs, as we know, will be enormous. In my opinion, the ECB must not, under any circumstances, continue to take the wrong path in this crisis. As a result of a number of different incorrect decisions, we are now on the threshold between an inflationary economic boom and a deflationary economic collapse. The important thing for us now is to avert, at any price, the real threat of the economically successful countries in the euro area being dragged into the abyss as well.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, first of all, let me welcome President Draghi to his first visit to Parliament. I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Tremosa, on the excellent job he has done in describing in an outstanding and comprehensible way the price stability in the euro area, as well as all the measures the ECB had to guarantee in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the future, the ECB will continue to have a special responsibility with regard to EU monetary policy and its coherence, and in applying an appropriate interest rate policy, as it indeed did in 2010. In my opinion, the ECB does need to be capable of intervening in the fight against the debt crisis and must, where appropriate, facilitate liquidity by purchasing government securities that are deemed too risky. It should do so with the aim of allowing the Member States concerned a moment of respite so as to be able to once again introduce investment-friendly, economically invigorating measures. Of course, all this needs to be undertaken under appropriate financial supervision.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Similarly, I welcome the idea to look into ways in which the ECB can contribute to the creation of a European Monetary Fund to ensure that there is no need for the IMF to be involved in credit policy, and thereby to reduce Member States’ dependence on international institutions. It is a sound idea and needs to be investigated, and impact assessments need to be prepared as to ways in which a mechanism for the issuance of eurobonds can be created in the future. Furthermore, as a fellow Member has also mentioned, I believe it is very important to ensure appropriate communications in the interest of credibility. I therefore endorse the proposal of the rapporteur that the minutes of meetings of the Governing Council should be made public, and consider it a good idea. To President Draghi, I wish sufficient determination and all the best for his future work.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Mr Bloom, thank you for your question. However, I already have reservations regarding the way the question is formulated, because you approach the issue in a very polarised manner. The economic situation is, in fact, fraught with crisis. If the ECB does not take a prominent role in this regard, and does not take a firm position, the situation you refer to in your question will indeed become reality. I do not think it is appropriate to ask whose money would pay for this, as the single EU monetary policy will have to provide suitable resources for this in the future. If it fails to do so, then we could indeed speak not only of the crisis, but also of the failure of the euro area, but I do not see eye to eye with you on this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, this annual report has finally broken certain taboos. It calls on the Commission to create a European credit rating foundation and to consider temporarily suspending credit ratings for countries that require support from the Union. The report recognises the merit of the European Central Bank (ECB) repurchasing bonds on the secondary market, which has allowed banks to maintain their balance sheets and continue to borrow on the interbank market. This action prevented a liquidity crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet in order to resolve the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB needs to be authorised to intervene on the primary market when it becomes illiquid. Even Germany is struggling to obtain funds. Italian bonds are being issued at ever-higher rates. If there is no intervention, the risk of Italy defaulting will seriously compromise the health of the banks. The banks will approve fewer loans and will not be able to meet the new solvency ratio requirements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament’s report also stresses the need for a European Treasury able to issue federal bonds at lower rates, as is the case in the United States. In the event of speculator activity, the ECB should be authorised to repurchase these eurobonds, like its counterparts in the US and the United Kingdom. Did you know that these two countries are generating funds at historically low rates, despite a rating downgrade for one of them?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, we are not in the same situation as Germany in the 1920s – nowadays, production capacities are underused. Therefore, demand is not driving inflation. There is no cost inflation because we have wage moderation, or because the gloomy economy is keeping commodities costs low despite speculatory activity. We need to acknowledge that the time has come for bold monetary policies, given the current failure to recognise that budgetary orthodoxy is absurd in times of recession.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, today’s debate is not the only one to revolve around the issue of whether the single currency can be saved by a change to the Treaty of Lisbon, closer fiscal coordination, the dependence or independence of the European Central Bank, a European Minister for Finance or the European Monetary Fund. In my opinion, the question should be asked in more general – and also far more serious – terms. Is this a euro crisis or a debt crisis? In this context, we should consider whether debts are a cause or a consequence of the current situation, and whether the crisis is about debts arising over the past few years or debts that are the consequence of European development over many decades. In this case, I believe there is no need to regard the current difficulties of the euro as a euro crisis, because the current difficulties merely revealed the profound structural problems of part of the European area. The call for Member States to follow a more fiscally responsible policy is therefore correct. Nevertheless, we are faced with the question here of whether there will be a change in the behaviour of people accustomed to the very high standards of the European social state or the European welfare state. Unless we have the courage to make significant reforms, and to transform the social welfare state, thus getting rid of high budgetary costs, then it will be very difficult to get out of the current difficulties.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have here a ransom note that was sent to the Italian Government on 5 August and sets forth a detailed prescription of austerity measures that had to be implemented. Every one of these measures involves attacks on the rights and living standards of working class people. The note is signed off by you, Mr Draghi, as well as by Jean-Claude Trichet, and comes from the European Central Bank. It finishes with a line that is fairly ominous: ‘We trust that the government will take all the appropriate actions’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The hostage here, of course, was the threat not to buy Italian bonds. Within the Troika, the ECB has been aggressively pushing the austerity measures that have pushed people to misery in Ireland, Portugal and Greece. The ECB has also been a central co-conspirator in the silent coups that have now been carried out in Greece and in Italy, replacing elected governments with governments of bankers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could you now please drop the pretence that has been repeated here today, that the ECB is in some way independent? It is independent only of any democratic checks and any accountability to ordinary people. It is subservient to the interests of the capitalist classes, the rich in the core euro countries, and it has acted as their shock troops throughout this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Central Bank has performed its role reasonably well – as well as it could – during the crisis; it has succeeded in keeping inflation low and intervened by buying bonds to limit financial instability.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not agree with those who would like to change the ECB’s formula or equip it with new powers: the ECB will never be the Federal Reserve, because Europe is different from the United States. In future, however, the Central Bank must refrain from intervening on every little issue with its public missives. It is right to indicate the objectives that should be achieved, but intervention methods must be left up to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Recently, the issue of government bonds has dramatically emerged. It is unacceptable to force a country that is struggling, and burdened by the constraints of the euro, to pay interest rates that are much higher than those applied to the other Member States. A solution must be found through the use of eurobonds to prevent a country in crisis from having insult added to injury.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, President Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Italian delegation in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), may I welcome you to this House in your role as the new President of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are laying down rules on budgets and on more rigorous fiscal discipline, but what we need right now are immediate responses, and I have the impression that the debate and the timetable in relation to eurobonds require time, which is something that we do not have. Rather, we need measures to promote growth and to prevent stagnation. The ECB has played an important role in the current crisis by buying government bonds that are subject to speculation and keeping interest rates and inflation low. Perhaps more than any other European institution, it has acted swiftly and effectively, but the crisis has become a crisis of our common currency, of the euro, which does not have the support that a currency should have. The ECB lacks the effectiveness and the authoritativeness of a proper central bank.</p>
      <p sl="it">The idea, floated recently, that the ECB may finance the Member States indirectly, in other words, by going through the International Monetary Fund and so managing to play a leading role in tackling the debt crisis, circumventing the restrictions laid down by statute, is hearsay, and I question whether there is really any truth in it. This is further evidence of the need to move on from the ECB and create a proper European central bank that is not only a guarantee and supervisory body but also a currency issuer.</p>
      <p sl="it">Like the US Federal Reserve, the ECB must become a lender of last resort, a currency guarantor, as happens for the dollar and the pound. This would also contribute towards the creation, Mr President, of the Europe of solidarity and of the Member States that our founding fathers, from Adenauer to Spinelli and De Gasperi, wanted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is not a mere stroke of bad luck that we find ourselves close to the edge of a catastrophe. It is simply a calculated act of brinkmanship on the part of all actors involved in the fate of the euro which has brought us to this point.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘Brinkmanship’ is defined as a calculated practice of pushing a situation to the brink of disaster in order to win an advantage from your opponent. We have witnessed brinkmanship by the creditor countries in the eurozone in order to extract the best terms possible from the debtor countries by minimising moral hazard and thus ensuring that they participate fully in the austerity programme laid out for them, as per the conditionality clause, and to do this with the consent of the majority of the population in one form or other; brinkmanship by the indebted countries, knowing full well that it is not in the interest of the eurozone paymaster to let them default; brinkmanship by the European Central Bank, which refuses to be drawn into the position of lender of last resort with the hope that the eurozone will find its own political solutions; brinkmanship by those in the European Parliament who spent endless hours upping the sanctions within the ‘six-pack’ and making sure that this time round, they securely lock the stable doors, ignoring the observation that the horse has already bolted; and brinkmanship by the Council, who earlier on in the year made such words as ‘eurobonds’ and ‘voluntary haircuts’ taboo, hoping that the ‘six-pack’ would provide a silver bullet.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, brinkmanship through a valid process has its dangers. We are in danger of going down in history as a political class who, because of being smart with these actions and strategies, presided over the collapse of the euro and global depression. Technically, the solutions have been known to all who wanted to see and listen. In whatever shape or form, they include instruments which combine an element of joint liability among all eurozone Member States and a watertight solution to the moral hazard issue. So let us act collectively on these core principles, for the rest is detail. But we must act now before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Commissioner, Governor, in 2010, the European Central Bank (ECB) applied the mechanism of purchasing euro area state bonds on secondary markets, despite opposition from several countries. In recent days, however, it has, for the first time, failed to sterilise these purchases. It needed to take out EUR 203.5 billion from the interbank market, but demand for its seven-day sterilisation operations was EUR 194.2 billion. This shows us that European banks are holding cash and not providing it even to the Central Bank, and also that the volume of bonds purchased is getting to be too high for the Bank to sterilise, and it has failed to increase the volume of euros in the financial system through bond purchases. If this trend of unsuccessful sterilisation operations continues, it will mean the equivalent of quantitative easing for the euro area, and thus a negative impact on the purchasing power of the European currency. It is therefore necessary, Governor, to modify ECB policy in a very sensitive way, in order to provide better protection for the euro and for the price stability of the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, in Mr Tremosa i Balcells’ report, the European Parliament fully acknowledges that the European Central Bank has played an active and decisive role throughout the crisis, since turmoil broke out on the financial markets in 2007 and 2008, up to the point, of course, when it intervened in the secondary government bond markets in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nonetheless, we know and you know that, as the crisis developed, it was not contained and has now become systemic and, of course, it is obvious that this is not the responsibility of the European Central Bank. As the European Parliament has systematically and repeatedly pointed out, the spread and propagation of the crisis was the result of hesitation and indecisiveness and delays in taking and applying the right decisions, primarily at political level by the governments of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, yesterday’s decision by the European Central Bank to which you referred, to coordinate its action at global level with the five biggest central banks in order to increase liquidity in the global financial system, doubtless has a positive dimension. It is a decision that will have beneficial results, temporarily. We all know that an immediate, effective, global response to the crisis is needed, a response that goes beyond and combines with the rules of stricter fiscal prudence to which you referred, in a new fiscal compact, as you called it.</p>
      <p sl="el">As other Members have said, we absolutely respect the independence of the European Central Bank which, however, apart from price stability, is the guardian of the euro, the common currency, and it is primarily this role that you are urgently being called upon to play. You know and we know that there is no way out of the crisis without a stronger role for the European Central Bank. It is, of course, up to you and the executive officer of the European Central Bank to consider all the proposals and to decide how.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is important to note that the European Central Bank (ECB) has done a good job so far during the euro crisis. With the latest interest rate reductions, interest rate policy has been returned to a reasonable level and the support programme for purchasing the bonds of the weakest countries in the euro area was necessary and balanced. The fact that the ECB has started to use a larger range of instruments than those traditionally used has been justified in view of the circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The crisis is a long way from being over, however. We are currently facing a situation in which the entire monetary union is at risk. An unexpected disturbance could upset the extremely fragile balance in state finances and on the financial markets. A second case like Lehman Brothers is, unfortunately, not an entirely unimaginable scenario.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this situation, a whole host of measures obviously need to be taken from a political standpoint. At the same time, there can be no doubt that part of the solution must also be for the European Central Bank to take a more active role. It must be possible in some way for the bank to act as a lender of last resort. This would improve stability in the monetary union in both the short and the long term.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A more active involvement is, of course, associated with increased risks in the bank’s balance sheet. However, this has to be weighed against the extremely serious risk scenario that the entire monetary union will be destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is now time for several different players to reconsider their position with regard to the ECB. The bank should be able do more than it is currently able to do. Such measures could effectively reduce the current turbulence. It is no good to simply wait and see what happens, either; measures must be taken now. Thank you for the opportunity to speak, and thank you to the rapporteur and the President of the ECB for joining us here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, as you will have guessed from many of the MEPs’ speeches, today, paradoxically, while no one is asking the European Central Bank to go beyond its remit, it is being asked to contribute a vision. Contributing a vision is something that the ECB certainly can do, not only by returning to its roots and hence fulfilling its role to the utmost, but also by being open to discussion with this institution, because it is obvious that, once we deem Mr Tremosa i Balcell’s ideas to be relevant and conducive to a plan that we intend to carry out to improve matters, we will have enabled politics to climb out of the abyss.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fundamental problem, to my mind, is this: we are caught in the abyss, and any indecision may prove fatal. Moreover, if we do not climb out of the abyss, a conflict awaits us at the end of this journey, a conflict with unforeseeable consequences. We are therefore calling on you to embrace the relationship with Parliament and to have faith in this institution. There is no shortage of us MEPs today, but we are certainly determined to help Europe to complete its project.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Draghi, welcome to this Parliament. We are living through exceptional and dramatic times, which require determined and urgent measures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The spiral between Member State debt and bank debt must be brought under control, but the priority at the moment is to defend the Member States, so as to ensure that the countries of the euro area and the euro itself are not destroyed by the credit rating agencies and speculators.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the Tremosa i Balcells report that we are about to adopt, we have proposals for rethinking the architecture of the euro area, and for creating eurobonds and a European treasury, but all of this takes time. We are talking about an emergency at the moment and, in this context, the only solution is in the hands of the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
      <p sl="pt">Technically, the ECB knows what needs to be done. It should not now be restricted by its mandate from intervening or acting. Its mandate is safeguarding the euro, not dealing with inflation. At times like these, there is no doubt: saving the euro and doing what is necessary is what this Parliament and the public expect of the ECB. I wish you good luck and courage, Mr Draghi.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to welcome Mr Draghi. Yes, certainly we need more integration but our citizens will not accept it – simply will not accept it – unless there is more democratic accountability and more social solidarity, and that has to be borne in mind. To avoid a collapse into a recession that will rival the hungry 1930s, we need to save the euro. The ECB must become the lender of last resort; there is no other way, in my view, that this can be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">When Ireland crashed, it had a budget surplus and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 25%; way below the 60% ceiling. Our problem arose because we nationalised private bank debt, which pushed our debt over 100% of GDP. Those debts were owed to French banks, to British banks, to German banks and indeed to a range of others. But we cannot survive, we cannot deal with that debt, without moving beyond the issue of fiscal consolidation and all of this language we have about fiscal discipline. We need growth in Europe, we need eurobonds, and I believe most of all we need a commitment to solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="en">European Central Bank. – Mr President, thanks to all the honourable Members of the European Parliament for their statements and their contributions. Let me say at the very beginning that I look forward to sharing views and to exchanging opportunities to look together at the present situation and to reflect together at this very difficult contingency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think many of your statements really come under one heading: how do we reconstruct confidence in the euro in the euro area? This process will have three pillars: the first one is what I called the setting of an anchor in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">This redesign of the fiscal rules, of the fiscal compact – meaning by this word an agreement of new fiscal rules – is necessary to create trust for all countries who are members of the euro area. This design has not been completed. I think the next few days will be very important in telling us whether we will make any progress on this path. This is very important because, as I said, this gives the long-term trust which is necessary for the other two pillars.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, for the second pillar, which is the design of a financing mechanism within the euro area, we have the EFSF. It is a design in which we have to put our confidence that it will work, but some steps are still needed, as we all know.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third pillar is the national economic policy response and frankly, we are seeing much improvement on that front. As I said before, I do believe that countries are nowadays on track. We see a good future, but we have to be aware that in the end, what matters is the delivery of the proposed reforms. Reforms – I do not want to be misunderstood – do not have to be focused only on the budget and budgetary issues; they also have to be structural reforms, reforms that enhance competitiveness and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">So these are the three pillars upon which confidence can be reconstructed. I have been asked: what is the role of the ECB in all this? Some of you said the ECB should do more; some of you said the ECB should do less. Let me start by saying the ECB can act within the Treaty, so the ECB should not be asked to do things that are not within the Treaty. The ECB is the lender of last resort for solvent banks. The ECB has created an enormous amount of liquidity and we see that this liquidity is now being redeposited with the ECB deposit facility, which means that it is not so much the amount of liquidity that matters, but it is the fact that this liquidity is not actually circulating through the banking channel, through the financial system, through the credit channel.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our view, the most important thing now for the ECB is to repair the credit channel in a way that enables this liquidity to actually finance the real economy – especially the small and medium-sized enterprises which are now in difficult conditions because they are the ones who mostly need the banks’ credit. The large corporations are, on average, generally speaking, able to access capital markets on their own, so they are less dependent on the banks. That is why we have to make sure that a credit channel will start to work again. We have observed serious credit tightening in the most recent period which, combined with a weakening of the business cycle, does not bode at all well for the months to come. I think this is one of the first things.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, some of you mentioned the SMP, the Securities Market Programme, should be more active, less active. Let me say – and I did say this a moment ago – that the rationale for having the SMP active is that you want to make sure that you repair the monetary policy transmission channels. It is not to create liquidity, it is not to subsidise governments; it is to repair the monetary policy transmission channels. That was the rationale with which it started and that is still the rationale with which we employ it. By itself, it is a non-standard measure and therefore, by itself, it is going to be temporary, it is going to be limited. Let me be clear about what I mean by limited. It is not eternal and it is not infinite.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to understand that the ECB can act within the Treaty. It would be a mistake to have the ECB acting outside the Treaty; it would not be legal and it would also be a mistake because it would, especially in some parts of Europe, undermine the credibility of the ECB, which nowadays, is the strongest signature in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I take the words on communication with great pleasure. It is true always, but especially in this situation of extreme difficulty, that it does not really make any sense to have a cacophony of voices anticipating monetary policy decisions, reflecting individual views and not the collegial decision-making process. I could not agree more. I will certainly take this message to the rest of the Governing Council, but, as I said, these are opportunities and occasions that are cherished very much and I will continue cherishing them. I am very much looking forward to my next meeting with the European Parliament, which is going to be in a few days with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, dear colleagues, thank you very much for your contributions to this debate. Mr Draghi, the ECB has rightly intervened and has prevented an even bigger disaster. The ECB has saved many Europeans from again experiencing massive bank runs. It seems that the financial markets do not trust the eurozone as an irreversible monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the pressure of the financial markets can help force the most indebted countries to curb their budgets and to increase their competitiveness. The crisis is an opportunity for more fiscal union, to underpin monetary union. The old nation states have to lose a part of their fiscal sovereignty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European crisis is also a political crisis. European citizens have discovered that the European Union does not have its own instruments to act against a huge crisis and that the European Union does not have its own resources to develop its own policies. The European Commission has been greatly weakened also by a lack of democratic legitimacy. Its President should be one of the Members of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Draghi, good luck with your work; more than ever, in the ECB we trust.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Without the euro, the global financial crisis would be much worse for all European countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The examples of this are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="sk">The historically strong pound has steadily lost value since 2008, leading to higher prices. Without the euro, the countries of Northern Europe would not have returned to growth so quickly. If the German mark had existed, it would have been so strong in relation to global currencies that German growth would have been damaged. Without the euro, the European countries that followed less sensible fiscal policies, and focused less on improving competitiveness, would have had to employ the sort of economic crisis measures adopted in Argentina in 2001. Their moral and economic collapse would have had terrible consequences.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There was a failure in one area: management of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The architects of the euro constructed the currency union, and they realised that a single currency might cause instability in countries with widely differing economic and manufacturing structures. These architects perhaps thought that steps would be taken towards greater political union when such steps were really needed. That time finally came today, with the euro area fully exposed to the effects of the debt crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must create a system which allows better control over euro area Member State budgetary policies that are not working.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Francesca Balzani, José Manuel Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee in the framework of the 2012 budgetary procedure (13110/2011 – C7-0247/2011 – 17470/2011 – 2011/2020(BUD)) (A7-0414/2011).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as we have seen, the previous debate did have some bearing on the outcome of the negotiations on the 2012 budget. As the President-in-Office of the Council is with us – and let me also welcome the Commissioner, Mr Lewandowski – I would like to say how pleased I am that an agreement has been reached in conciliation on the 2012 draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This agreement will allow us to conclude the budgetary procedure within the deadlines set out in the Treaty and implementing texts. I would like to thank the Commission and congratulate the young Polish Presidency on achieving unanimity within the Council. The agreement refers both to the 2012 budget and to draft amending budget No 6/2011. I would also like to congratulate our rapporteurs, who will tell us which are the key points for the European Parliament within this budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this period of crisis, which we have discussed at length, we have succeeded in reconciling two apparently contradictory objectives, both equally necessary: on the one hand, reducing operating costs, and, on the other, maintaining essential future spending in order to support economic activity and guarantee future competitiveness. Yet, at the same time, there are two lessons that we need to learn from this achievement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lesson one is that we cannot continue to negotiate backwards, starting with payment appropriations, when political choices translate into commitment appropriations. Parliament wants the three institutions to work together with cool heads in the coming months in order to examine how the appropriations are spent and the precise requirements, line by line. This should ensure that our examination of the 2013 budget will be based on full information, avoiding another budget freeze with adjustments across the board for the third year running.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second lesson is that we have proved that we can no longer fund the European budget from national contributions. Next Monday, we will begin negotiations between Parliament and the Council, together with the Commission, on the new own resources needed to fund the European budget and reduce national contributions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For Parliament’s part – I have said it before and I say it again here formally – there can be no agreement on the next financial framework without a political agreement on going back to financing from own resources. Here and there, I hear loud voices calling for budgetary federalism. This is the best opportunity for those making those strong calls to translate their dreams into a European reality.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 November, Parliament and the Council reached a common position on the budget three days ahead of the conciliation deadline. This is a good sign: at a time of great uncertainty and difficulty, it means that the European institutions want to look to the future first; it is also a decision to shoulder their responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="it">From the start, Parliament has put the EU 2020 strategy, the major crisis-prevention strategy for future growth and wellbeing, at the centre of the budget. Drafting a budget is no easy task for anyone today, not even for Europe, but Parliament made a choice, which was fully accepted during the conciliation. Thus, we have more resources for growth, research, employment, lifelong learning, immigration policies and international policies in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">Payments, however, fared badly in the conciliation. They fared badly, which is nothing new. Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that there is strong disagreement – clear and ongoing disagreement – over the issue of payments between Parliament and the Commission on one side, and the Council on the other. Disagreement that will have to be solved, that will have to be overcome, because this is a situation that we clearly cannot tolerate any longer. Unfortunately, however, conciliation is not the ideal forum in which to open discussions, in which to open conciliations, because – and the experience of the past year has clearly taught us this – opening major discussions in the strict and rigorous confines of the conciliation procedure is liable to simply jeopardise the forthcoming budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission’s faultless projections of funding requirements – and I want to emphasise this point – the Commission’s extremely authoritative and reliable projections, which Parliament endorsed, are thus rendered useless. I hope that this can be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear, in my view, that we will not find a permanent solution to this problem until the European budget is equipped with its own resources. However, what we, as Parliament, certainly can do – in line with the commitment to intervene promptly should payment needs increase during the year, which we signed and attached to the budget – what we certainly can and must do is to strive to ensure that this commitment is honoured and, above all, to work together to ensure that this commitment is not a victim, in terms of its form and schedule, of the next budgetary conciliation, because what we must do – and this is the decision that we made with ITER, that we made this year on the subject of payments – is to refrain from opening conciliations within the conciliation procedure.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to thank everyone: all my fellow Members who made an enthusiastic contribution to the drafting of this budget; the Polish Presidency, which played an important role and provided impetus; and especially the Commission, Commissioner Lewandowski, who maintained an exceptional balance throughout the entire delicate conciliation procedure. Then there are the policy advisors from our groups, and finally our assistants, who worked long into the night on this task.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, first of all, please allow me to thank all those who have worked on the budgets of Parliament and the other institutions. I would thank the political groups and shadow rapporteurs for their work, and I would thank the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for their excellent collaboration and excellent work, and for the results we have achieved. I would also highlight our excellent collaboration with the Bureau of the European Parliament and the work we have carried out, and the support we have had from the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets. I would stress the involvement of officials of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, specifically, the excellent technical work by the adviser, Nicole Witts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also point out the rigorous work that all the institutions have done on their administrative budgets, despite the costs of Croatia’s accession, in connection with the entry of another 18 Members to this House, the existence of new institutions and the consolidation of others, such as the European External Action Service, and as regards new tasks and competences. Despite all this, the administrative and operating budgets of all the European Union institutions have increased by just 1.3%. Given inflation and given the new commitments, this has only been possible with rigorous and efficient management, and with structural changes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The 2012 administrative budget for the institutions has grown negatively. I welcome the results of the conciliation that took place on Friday, 18 November, regarding the budgets of the European Parliament and of the other institutions. The Council adopted the European Parliament’s entire proposal on the administrative and operating costs of all the European institutions, and acknowledged that our proposal was rigorous and fair. The hard work, austerity and balancing of budget cuts, on the one hand, and the minimum necessary for each institution to run properly, on the other, has been worth it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is a fact that should always be remembered: all the administrative and operating costs of all the European Union institutions correspond to less than 6% of the EU budget. This means that more than 94% of the Union budget goes on investment. It should also be remembered that the European Union budget, despite representing only 1% of Union GDP, provides an important stimulus; a benefit, through which coordinated solidarity is possible. This budget should therefore be increased, in particular during times of crisis like these.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, I welcome the increase in funds intended for economic growth, for training, for research and for young people. However, I shall finish by warning the Council of a concern: it is important to meet commitments in times of credibility; it is important to meet payment expenditure, particularly when it relates to cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is the first time we have had to negotiate the European budget during a financial crisis as serious as the one we are experiencing at this very moment. For the first time, we have succeeded in bringing this process to a positive conclusion in less time than provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. This is a great success for the European Union as a whole and for all the institutions involved. In this respect, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament as a whole and, most of all, Mr Lamassoure and the rapporteurs Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, Commissioner Lewandowski and the entire team, for approaching the discussion this year in such a constructive and responsible manner, resolving the major problems faced by the European Union in the coming year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to stress that throughout the whole process of negotiating the 2012 budget, there were no serious disputes as to the priorities of the European Union which should be financed in the future. Instead, there was a very precise and professional discussion concerning the funds which are needed to implement the priorities and how these priorities should be arranged so that European society gains the most favourable impression of EU policies, and so that these policies are directed primarily at issues where they are most eagerly anticipated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, in response to this spirit of reconciliation which prevailed in the course of our debates, the Council approved all the priorities proposed by Parliament, particularly regarding commitment appropriations. Similarly, I would like to thank you for the European Parliament’s very positive and tolerant attitude towards, and full understanding of, the priorities proposed by the Council, in particular, in relation to the payment appropriations. Parliament has shown itself to be fully open to the needs of the Member States and their budgetary situations, and to the crisis which prevails today, and has displayed a full understanding of the issues while studying the Council’s proposals in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also have the pleasure today of informing you that yesterday, during the meeting of the ECOFIN Council, the 2012 budget was adopted unanimously, while a majority voted was obtained in favour of letter of amendment No 6 to the 2011 budget, so, as far as the Council is concerned, the entire budgetary procedure for the year 2012 has been completed successfully.</p>

    <intervention id="4-076-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janusz Lewandowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome, in the name of the Commission, the agreement on the 2012 budget. This timely agreement is a positive and reassuring signal, because this is about continuity and stability at this very unstable time in Europe, with so many question marks. I would also say openly that the forecasts and priorities on the part of Parliament are very responsive to the needs of Europe today. It is about competitiveness, it is about migration, and it is about additional neighbourhood policy needs, including some frontloading for Palestine also.</p>
      <p sl="en">This timely agreement reached on the 2012 budget will make for timely implementation of that budget. This is really very important. What is also important is that the increase in operational expenditure is well balanced by self-restraint in administration. It has rightly been mentioned already that this is less than 6% of the budget, but the institutions are nonetheless making every effort to restrain administrative expenditure in the European Union. This time, it is lower than in the draft budget, although we have to plan to welcome Croatia also into our family of 27 – increasing to 28 – nations. I have to congratulate Ms Balzani for her part of the report on the choice of priorities, and Mr Fernandes on his part of the report on this self-restraint action on administration.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to cover needs, we need to use the flexibility instrument that was agreed between Parliament and the Council. This timely agreement could not have happened without the constructive role of the Polish Presidency, and personally of Minister Dominik, so my thanks to him, because this has also given a positive signal to the beneficiaries of the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has already been expressed on so many occasions, the level of payments might not be enough. I have to say this once more. I have to repeat that, in contrast to national annual budgets, the European budget is about investment. I know what the overall share of investment is in the budget for 2012 of the country I know best, which has been reduced to below 5% I think. More than 50 or 60% of the European budget should be classified as clearly being investment expenditure, covering the deficit of investment in the European Union with a multiplier effect on jobs and growth. If we have less for 2012 in real terms than for 2011, there will be some problems for the future as we are today also running short of payments, as is reflected in amending budget No 6. We have to reflect on the procedure of annual budgeting at the end of a financial perspective in terms of an increase in payments. That is normal and is no surprise.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the previous discussion, your rapporteur in Parliament said to President Draghi: ‘in the Central Bank we trust’. I personally trust in the joint declaration and in its credibility if there is a need for additional payments for 2012. I trust also that we have delivered all the necessary information to release the reserves. Once more, congratulations and thanks to everyone involved, including Alain Lamassoure, for reaching a timely agreement for 2012.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I take the liberty, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), of thanking the rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes, as well as Commissioner Lewandowski, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dominik, and all my fellow Members, for the excellent work done and for the spirit of cooperation shown. I believe that the agreement reached during the night of Friday 18 November, after almost 16 hours of negotiations, has produced a good result, especially given the serious economic crisis and the difficulties faced by the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as commitment appropriations are concerned, I am satisfied with the decision to use the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 200 million for headings 1 and 4, as Parliament had requested, in order to boost industrial competitiveness, finance priority policies, which are the essence of the Europe 2020 strategy, and tackle the difficult challenges in terms of neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear that Parliament’s priorities have been fulfilled for the other policies from the point of view of commitment appropriations. However, it is also true that, as many MEPs have emphasised in the speeches before this one, and as the rapporteurs themselves have stressed, the agreement cannot be said to be as satisfactory where payment appropriations are concerned, not least because the gap between commitments and payments has widened, which will increase the amount of liabilities to be paid, and because of the difficulties that the Commission may encounter in financing certain programmes that are due to expire.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe, however, that today’s vote in Parliament, like the one yesterday in the Council, will serve to ratify a strict and responsible budget that takes full account of the crisis but that, at the same time, seeks to boost investment and the economy in order to achieve the aim of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, my thanks to the Commission, the Polish Presidency and, in particular, to our own rapporteurs, Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Following lengthy negotiations, we reached a compromise, and our group will support the compromise, as we have managed to get a large number of Parliament’s priorities included: research and development, lifelong learning and neighbourhood policy, in particular, with regard to Palestine. I support the compromise, but the negotiations also give cause for a great deal of concern for the future and have resulted in a lot of criticism within the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We find it worrying that most of the negotiations were devoted to resolving conflicts within the Council, where a minority coalition of wealthier net contributors, including Sweden, are playing an increasingly negative role. They seem to be prepared to block an offensive policy for the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am convinced that the EU’s budget needs to be strengthened in certain crucial areas if we are to be able to make a positive contribution to recovery, growth and employment, particularly in those Member States where the need is greatest. We must also improve our implementation of what has been promised in the budget. We therefore need to focus on implementation, payments and at least paying our accounts on time.</p>
      <p sl="sv">With the extremely negative attitude of certain Member States towards the EU’s role, we run the risk in future negotiations on the long-term budget of ending up in the worst situation imaginable where certain Member States wish to safeguard agricultural policy and refuse to amend it while others refuse to increase the budget. The risk is that we will not get new resources for what is really needed: research and development, infrastructure and energy and climate initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In view of the fact that the Commission, a broad majority of Parliament and the majority of the Member States agree on these needs, I hope that the Polish Presidency and the forthcoming Danish Presidency will actually be able to persuade the blocking minority to consider their responsibility and adopt a more constructive position.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating and thanking our two rapporteurs on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and also by thanking the Council and the Commission for their excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our group will also support the compromise that we are to vote on today. It feels positive to be able to say this in view of the fact that, when we previously voted on our negotiating mandate in the autumn, we abstained because, at that time, we believed that we were trying to increase the budget by too much. In the current economic climate, a 5% increase in the budget quite simply would not be justified. Now the budget is increasing by just under 2%, which is a reasonable figure in the economic situation in which we find ourselves right now.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another positive aspect is that we actually succeeded in shifting the expenditure to measures oriented towards the future, namely those already mentioned by Mr Färm, such as research and development, lifelong learning and so on. At the same time, in our external relations, we can also focus on what has happened in North Africa in what has been referred to as the Arab Spring. This requires Europe’s attention, not only in the form of policies, but also in the form of funding. All of this is positive, and it means that we can, in fact, happily vote in favour of this budget today.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What causes us a certain amount of concern for the future, however, is the fact that, as has already been said, within the Council, there are those who believe that we do not need to fulfil the agreements that we have entered into. However, we have to pay for what we have already agreed. This is something that cannot be repeated. Last year, we almost failed to reach an agreement on the budget at all. We reached an agreement this year, and that was probably necessary in the current economic climate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Given the mood in the Council, there may well be a great deal of resistance in this context in future, and therefore there is probably reason for certain Member States in the Council to consider just what it is they have agreed on in order to avoid future budget crises in the EU – something that we really do not need with all of these other economic problems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Parliament seems reluctantly to have accepted a 2012 budget with an increase below 2%, effectively less than 2011 in real terms, but what an opportunity has been missed for Parliament to show that it is in the real world and getting to grips with economic reality. Do we honestly think that funds have been well spent in the past by the European Union or that they will be well spent in the future? Across Europe, governments are having to cut their budgets to overcome massive deficits while desperately trying to induce economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meanwhile, the European Union’s appetite just seems to grow. This budget should have seen major substantive cuts, with funds returned to the treasuries of our countries. All the EU’s efforts should be focused on economic growth, on competition, and indeed on areas such as research and development. Instead, over the years, it has accrued more and more areas of competence where frankly it has no business. There are whole swathes of activity that the European Union could cut. We could have set an example with Parliament’s own budget, admittedly only a small part of the overall budget but nevertheless significant, costing some EUR 1.6 billion a year. New Direction, the think-tank, has identified cuts that could easily have been made – a quarter of the budget could be cut, some EUR 400 million could be saved by this Parliament without affecting the core roles of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The driving force in Parliament’s costs has been the massive inflation of Parliament’s bureaucracy, out of all proportion to the number of MEPs. Parliament owns or rents some 62 buildings. We see no way at the moment in which they seem to be cutting back. It is time for the European Union to end excess.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Lamassoure, ladies and gentlemen, the budget for 2012 is an austerity budget with increases below the rate of inflation. The political question that we need to ask ourselves and to find an answer to is whether this represents a correct, forward-looking, pro-European decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">From a green perspective, the EU budget and the national budgets should be setting new priorities. We must remove the non-sustainable policies, in particular, at a European level in the areas of agricultural and Structural Funds. We need to put in their place sustainable policies that will promote competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">A dramatic figure has been quoted for 2010 which is that global CO2 emissions have increased by 6%. That is not a policy which we can continue if we want to save our planet. From our perspective, the European budget is not doing enough in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are living in times of austerity and I would like to emphasise that I know what I am talking about, because I come from Bremen, the smallest German state, and we have been forced to make savings for years. I do not live on the moon and I am not an alien who has landed in Brussels. I understand the suffering in the Member States, but their budgets have all risen in recent years, while the European budget has seen much smaller increases. However, we have to put this in proportion. Therefore, I believe that there is justification for saying that it is right that the small European budget, which amounts to only 1% of the GDP of the Member States, must be increased in specific policy areas, because this is all about spending for the future and about new competitiveness which is so badly needed in many European Member States. The European budget must implement a clear policy in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are the positive aspects of this budget from a green perspective? There is funding of EUR 25 million for the new financial supervisory bodies which are urgently needed to enable us to regulate the financial markets more effectively. There are important pilot projects for innovation and also for the sustainable financing of online cultural markets. In our own administrative budget for Parliament, there is also the intention to make structural savings, including a reduction of EUR 20 million in spending on translation and interpreting and cuts in travelling costs. These are clear signs that the Members of this House are prepared to impose their own restrictions on the budget. I believe that this also sends an important signal to the public, to the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen and, in particular, the representative of the Council, whether this is a budget that really takes European added value and our common European interests seriously. I cannot see that this is the case. In the light of our major challenge – the conference in Durban is taking place at the moment – as Mr Lewandowski has once again said, the European budget should look quite different. It is, above all, an investment budget. Despite the need for austerity, we must use this budget to create new targeted incentives for new sustainable products, technologies and jobs to enable us to be more successful in the internal market and also on the global market. Only when Europe takes the lead with products of this kind will we have a chance of being competitive with emerging economies such as China and India. We need to do more. I think that a sense of common European determination is lacking in this budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where do I believe that the European Council is being inconsistent? It has constantly called for savings to be made. However, when it comes to the nuclear fusion reactor for which fission products such as tritium are needed, if indeed it ever functions properly, we will be spending EUR 1.3 billion more over the next two years. I would like to ask you whether you think this is consistent. If we really want to make savings, we should focus on future expenditure, in particular, in the area of research policy, where we know that we will be successful over the next few years. In the case of the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, this is completely uncertain. Therefore, it is wrong to take funding from the research framework programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, I believe that there is a problem with regard to interinstitutional trust. The Council made the statement that the commitment appropriations that we enter into should really be paid. Now this is no longer quite so clear. Therefore, my group is unable to vote in favour of this budget.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the draft 2012 budget will not meet requirements. My opinion differs from that of Commissioner Lewandowski. In terms of research, environmental sustainability, territorial cohesion and social solidarity, this budget does not have the muscle to either compensate for or correct the national austerity policies being followed throughout Europe. This is a budget that does not acknowledge Europe’s slide back into recession, unemployment and widespread insecurity amongst the younger generations. A budget below 1% of gross domestic product, and lower than that for 2011 in real terms, is a minimal budget for a minimal Europe. It is business as usual. So as to water down the evidence of this, the proposal has decided to increase or augment the divergence between commitments and payments; in other words, it is covering up a bad budget with bad budgetary practice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The alternative would have been to set out more clearly the priorities for negative investment that would free up resources for positive investment. In this budget, however, spending on security and military research is increased, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) is strengthened, funding for big multinationals is increased, and export subsidies that are ruinous for developing countries are retained.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall conclude by saying that we have been overcome by schizophrenia: we all talk about more and better Europe, but, in the end, we always choose less Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Parliament and the Commission’s demand for a 5% increase for the 2012 budget was ridiculous, but the Council’s acceptance of a real 2% rise is a slap in the face for taxpayers in Europe. In a doomed pursuit of its Lisbon agenda, the EU has squandered more than one trillion euro of taxpayers’ money. I say the number again: one trillion euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">Funds are given to the Commission which fails to properly control their use, and yet it always comes back to us for more. The present economic and financial situation in Europe is, without a doubt, a reflection of the abject failure in the use of funds. While this wasteful spree goes on in Brussels, Mr Osborne in the UK has announced further budget cuts.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I tell the government in the UK today: no, Mr Hague, the EU budget is not under control; no, Mr Cameron, a 2% rise is not a freeze. For goodness sake, stop sending more British taxpayers’ money to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, despite much criticism, the 2012 budget is an austerity budget. This is a good sign for our citizens. It shows that the European Parliament is proposing an appropriate budget for these difficult economic times. To remind you, firstly, 94% of the EU budget goes to our citizens. Secondly, 6% funds the work of the EU institutions and, thirdly, the EU budget for 2012 represents an increase of 1.86% over this year and amounts to 0.98% of the GNI of the EU. This more than meets the demands of some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite all the austerity measures, we must not forget that this period of crisis must be followed by a future. However, with 20% youth unemployment, this promises to be extremely difficult for subsequent generations. Therefore, despite all the financial constraints, we must invest more, both in education and in creating sustainable jobs, so that we do not slide further into the crisis. For example, Greece has a great deal of potential. We can invest in solar power plants there which will not only create sustainable jobs, but will also help us to achieve our climate goals if we can transfer the electricity to our part of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, it has been a difficult year for both Francesca Balzani and José Manuel Fernandes. It has also been a difficult year for the parliamentary Delegation to the Budget Conciliation Committee, led by Alain Lamassoure.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Presidency-in-Office of the Council may be happy, and with reason: it saved its own match point in the tennis game that the 2012 budget negotiations turned into, particularly during conciliation night, with the inclusion of amending budget No 6/2011 and the financial implications of the ITER project.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I do not see many other reasons to be pleased. The unwritten rules of budget negotiation have been changed for the second time. Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, a level was set for commitment appropriations in the budget conciliation, and then we negotiated the necessary payment appropriations. Now, the Council unilaterally sets the level of the payment appropriations and the level of the commitment appropriations is negotiated afterwards. This undermines the European Commission’s estimates and presents Parliament with a fait accompli .</p>
      <p sl="es">On this occasion, Parliament will accept this because of the economic emergency we are experiencing, which makes agreement essential, even if the agreement is a poor one. However, Mr Dominik, this way of negotiating does not bode well at all for the forthcoming negotiations on the multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like other colleagues, I also want to thank the two rapporteurs for the tremendous job they have done in putting this budget together. I first of all want to say a few words on the general budget, before going on to the European Parliament’s budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the general budget, I would say that I support the agreement which we reached at conciliation, but also that I have some concerns. I am particularly concerned that in conciliation, we reached an agreement on the budget which does not allow enough funds to go to Structural Funds in the future, and that this will have particular implications for regions and countries across the European Union such as Wales.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Wales, we benefit greatly from Structural Funds, and if there is not enough money for Structural Funds in 2012, the blame will lie with the Council. The Council should understand and recognise that Structural Funds are an important part of creating jobs and growth in the European Union and if we do not have enough money to fund those Structural Funds, the Council, as I said, should accept the blame.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the European Parliament’s budget, which is perhaps my main responsibility, I believe Parliament has done its bit in terms of the budget. Parliament has accepted savings of around EUR 74 million – savings in interpretation, translation, etc. Importantly, Members of this Parliament have accepted savings as well, in terms of accepting a freeze in the office allowance and a cut in the travel budget. I believe, in future, we can do even more to make further savings.</p>
      <p sl="en">For me, the important message of this budget is that this Parliament recognises our priorities. We recognise that our priorities should be in putting money into jobs and growth – things like Structural Funds – while, at the same time, making savings where we possibly can.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council Presidency, Mr Lewandowski and, in particular, the two rapporteurs who, together with the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, have done an excellent job. The tough negotiations that formed part of the conciliation procedure lasted for 17 hours and the European Parliament spent two hours of this in discussions with the Council. Perhaps it would be sensible next time around if the Council did not hold its negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but instead reached a common position first. That would make the job easier for all of us and would extend the Saturday morning slightly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, we have nominally agreed on a sensible budget. We have accommodated the Council’s requirements. At the Council’s request, the payments were limited to EUR 129 billion and the commitment appropriations were set at EUR 147 billion, which is what Parliament wanted. We should not be under any illusions, however. We are pushing a very dangerous avalanche along. The Council is prepared to finance the commitments that have been entered into by means of supplementary budgets, but I would prefer a commitment to establishing a budget from the beginning with a clear financial basis, so that we do not need constant amending budgets. This simply postpones the problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another problem that has emerged is the fact that the European Union needs more investment in research and development. Everyone, including the Member States, clearly supports this. However, this will not work with a capped budget, unless we are prepared to abandon our dogmatic approach to preserving the status quo and our subsidy mindset. If we do not restructure the budget in favour of research and development and the Europe 2020 strategy, we will not be able to meet these priorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we have also shown that, at a time when citizens have to tighten their belts, the European Parliament can do the same. I would like to thank Mr Fernandes in particular, who has made an excellent job of initiating this process.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have achieved a good result and we will be able to vote in favour of this budget. However, we still have to discuss whether this is the right approach in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it was not at all easy to reach agreement over the proposed budget this year, and we know that the resulting compromise was adopted in the Council by a slim majority. The total expenditure of just over EUR 129 billion represents a rise of 1.86% and, in my opinion, reflects the consolidated efforts of Member States at national level and the reality of the economic situation facing the continent of Europe today. Put simply, European expenditure during this crisis period has been kept under a tight rein, and below the expected level of inflation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">For me personally, as the coordinator for my group in the Committee on Regional Development, the main priority in deciding on the 2012 budget was, is and continues to be the provision of sufficient resources for cohesion, in other words, for Heading 1b, in order to comply with all of the commitments from previous years. It is therefore vital for us that the budget agreement includes a strong shared determination regarding the payments under item 3.1, securing sufficient funding for the area of cohesion policy, in case of need.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the process of negotiating with the Council has brought us the expected result: more has been cut from something that was already short; very short. The customary ritual will be followed: self-professed pro-Europeans of various stripes, who beat their chests in here when talking about the importance of a robust budget in the service of growth and development, are preparing to vote – without blushing – for this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This final proposal is below 1% of EU gross domestic product and will represent a decrease in the EU budget in real terms compared with last year. At the same time as they are tightening the noose of instruments like the Stability and Growth Pact and are freezing or even deepening the inequalities between the Member States, they are reducing to almost nothing the redistributive function of the budget, which would play a key role in reducing these inequalities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">All this is greatly exacerbated by intervention in the countries suffering the programmes of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. More so than the dead letters in the Treaties, the much-vaunted cohesion is increasingly a big lie.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, please note that, a fortnight ago, a Chinese investor said that the problems occurring in European countries were entirely the product of a society in its death throes, built on socialist ideals. These encourage laziness rather than hard work. The system of incentives has gone totally off the rails.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The problem with the 2012 EU budget is, indeed, the socialist demand, made by the European Parliament and the Commission, that more and more money be spent when this is simply not possible. Social democracy is working to protect its own interests and that has led to totally irresponsible behaviour. This is reflected in the 2012 budget. This budget, which has been increased again, will only create more jobs for the established euro clique, which has divided the pie up between its members. Our citizens have ended up with nothing. No value has been added: on the contrary. The 2012 budget will not resolve our problems, it will make them worse.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The only solution which Europe really needs is to cut back on pointless things and focus on those things that directly contribute to the recovery of jobs, so that our citizens can earn their living honestly and meet the needs of their families. Yet, the EU will achieve none of that with the 2012 budget. The EU is failing and contributing to its own decline. That is obviously not what the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) wants, and it is, therefore, voting against the 2012 budget, on behalf of Dutch citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first good news here is that there is an agreement between the Council and Parliament. This will allow the EU to continue to be functional in the upcoming year as well. Furthermore, as a Hungarian, I can say that the lines that are most important to us remained essentially untouched as compared to the Commission’s original proposal. The functioning of agricultural policy has been ensured. In the convergence line, there is an almost nine per cent increase. We could argue whether this is much or little, but at any rate, it is more or less realistic.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are smaller items for us to be happy about, such as the EUR 9 million increase in funds that can be spent on school milk, a very successful programme. Moreover, we can also be happy about things that do not require any money, or at least no additional money, such as the adoption of the proposal to allocate resources to the conservation, maintenance and development of endangered languages under cultural funds.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Naturally, there are negative aspects as well. There is our debate with the Council about whether the entire European budget can be involved, or needs to be involved, in the process of resolving the crisis. We believe that there is much, much more that could be done in this regard. Still, if I were to weigh the positive and negative aspects against each other I would not even use the metaphor of the glass that is half empty or half full. Our glass is a good 80% full, and the remaining 20% require further efforts over the coming years. I hope that we will be able to achieve this similar to how we were able to achieve the progress made so far. The Group of the European People’s Party will obviously endorse this budget.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think that at times, when we get heavily involved in a discussion and really get down to detail, we can lose sight of the bigger picture to some degree. That is why I would like to remind those of you ladies and gentlemen who are so strongly criticising the outcome of this negotiation that the degree of similarity between the Commission’s proposal and Parliament’s proposals could be more than 95%. I think, if we look at the outcome of the negotiation from the perspective of the commitments, the result is not too bad.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have strengthened programmes that will enable us to tackle the crisis: entrepreneurial initiative and innovation programmes, the Intelligent Energy – Europe Programme, and programmes such as Erasmus Mundus. We have also committed money that will help our neighbours to the south of the Mediterranean look to a democratic future.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, one cannot deny that happiness is never absolute. For the past three years, the Council has had just one word on its mind: austerity. You are incapable of seeing beyond it. Parliament has not been convinced by austerity as a principle, and the results of the austerity policies on the European economy, subjected to all kinds of pressure, have not helped to change our minds.</p>
      <p sl="es">Yet the Council continues to focus only on austerity, and it has taken a further potentially dangerous step. Limiting payment appropriations as far as possible is one thing, but failing to fulfil accepted obligations, which is what is happening now, is something else altogether. This is neither rigour nor austerity. What you are doing is failing to comply with your accepted commitments.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would also like to express my great satisfaction with the result that we have achieved, with Parliament having secured the necessary funds for Palestine, the necessary appropriations for research, and also the funding for the fusion energy project ITER for next year, without cuts in the framework programme for research being too large.</p>
      <p sl="da">Nevertheless, I do have one concern about the result that we have achieved and that concerns Amendment No 6. I think we will find ourselves in an extremely intolerable situation if we have the Council/Member States, on the one hand, promising to come up with extra funds if there should be a need for them, saying that they will ensure that the EU can pay its bills, but then, when the Commission approaches them and needs more money to be able to pay the bills, several countries say that they do not believe that the Commission’s figures are correct – without even providing a description of the correct figures. In my view, that is a completely intolerable situation. Of course we must pay our bills. Mr Lewandowski mentioned that 50-60% of the EU’s budget is an investment budget and that, at the start of the period, the bills that need to be paid are not so large, but that they are large at the end of the period, and right now we are at the end of the seven-year programming period.</p>
      <p sl="da">The first e-mail that I opened after arriving home from the budget negotiations was from a Danish research company. It asked what is happening at the moment, and continued by saying that it has always been difficult to get money out of the EU, but that the payments were now being delayed more than ever before.</p>
      <p sl="da">I believe that we are creating problems for ourselves down the line, and I would simply like to ask the Council to make sure that we fulfil our responsibility and to ensure that the EU can pay its bills. It would be unacceptable to do anything else.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Union is very much in need of good news at present, and the fact that the EU institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – have agreed on the European Union’s annual budget for 2012 is indeed good news. I would like to thank everyone present here for their good will and cooperation, and also to extend my particular thanks to the staff: our assistants and advisors and the staff of the Secretariat, who often work through the night, under appalling working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must not forget, however, that fundamental, important and very serious problems associated with the European Union budget have not been resolved during our negotiations; moreover, the problems that we will face as a budgetary authority in the near future can be seen very clearly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to focus in particular on the issue of amending budget No 6 for the year 2011. I am glad that we have managed to agree on the amending budget as well, but it can be seen that the problems which have come to light in this budget will recur; what is more, they will accumulate. Why is this? In my view, it results from people’s expectations of the European Union, its ambitions and plans, the launching of new policies and new measures, such as common diplomacy, its ever-greater involvement in policy related to humanitarian operations, its pursuit of ambitious structural measures, its activities in the field of research – the list could go on forever. All of these ambitions, measures and expectations are not accompanied by any desire on the part of the Member States to finance them. This is a problem which not only will not disappear, but will intensify, because we are committing ourselves to more and more measures, and yet there are no payments to go with them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that the openness and dialogue we have seen during the conciliation procedure will accompany us as we resolve the problem of payments I have been discussing. I am certainly very open to such a debate. I thank you once again, and I think that the conciliation procedure is the beginning of a long road.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, this 2012 budget is the Council budget, to which the European Parliament has added a little spiritual something by ensuring the inclusion of a few priorities, but priorities in the form of commitment appropriations, which, Commissioner, will exacerbate the problem of amounts outstanding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The countercyclical development and growth targets have again been severely obstructed in the EU budget for 2012. Firstly, because competition between programmes, which is the consequence of cutting costs willy-nilly, has been given priority at the expense of structuring measures that would allow us to take an active role in overcoming the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, because Member States are refusing to honour payments in a timely manner – despite being legally required to do so – and are therefore deterring project leaders from developing structural initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, because the Council has refused to increase, among other things, the funding for financial supervisory authorities and to further the creation of a proper fund to manage farming crises, thereby turning a blind eye to the context in which this budget will have to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States are therefore imposing austerity measures on the European Union, just as they have done for their own citizens. The current negotiations on this budget are merely the precursor to the impending negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It will be hard to resolve the apparent lack of confidence between the institutions, resulting, in particular, from the Council’s decision to question the figures provided by the Commission, which I am sure you appreciated, Commissioner, and the failure to comply with decisions that apply to both branches of the budgetary authority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet there are instruments in place for that purpose – I am referring to new own resources, which could put an end to the inevitable deadlock created by the antagonism between net contributors and net beneficiaries. There is now no time to waste.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we must thank the rapporteurs who, under some extremely difficult conditions with virtually no possible scope for negotiation, have successfully fulfilled, as far as has been possible, the European Parliament’s objectives. We must also be pleased that there is a budget and that we have reached agreement on it. During the current crisis, I believe that having a budgetary crisis as well was not helpful. We only reached this situation thanks to the prudent actions of Parliament, which could have blocked the whole process. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same degree of prudence in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have gone through the budgetary procedure twice so far, as stipulated by the Treaty of Lisbon. The exact same scenario has taken place every time: the Council imposed the figures for payments and did not agree to any kind of negotiation, which is not normal at all. I do not believe that this procedure of stating the figures and then making the allocations in the European policies is the normal procedure. In my view, we should do the reverse: we should see what the requirements are first, then calculate the budget.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Council has issued a statement each time, committing itself to accept budget amendments where the amounts required for payments cannot be achieved. It has not kept its word: just look at what happened with Amendment No 6 to the budget. I do not know whether it will do this next year. We cannot carry on like this, not having confidence in the figures presented by the Commission. There are two procedures of paramount importance coming up next year: the 2013 budget and the multiannual financial framework (MFF). If we are going to go through the exact same procedure, I do not believe that this will be beneficial to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, let me start by emphasising that, for the first time, this agreement has been adopted entirely within the deadlines set out in the Treaty of Lisbon for the new budgetary procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, for the second year running, the European Parliament has accepted the Council’s reading on increasing payments by less than 2% this year, which means less than in 2011 in real terms. We have repeatedly said that this decision is at odds with the Commission’s estimates, which identified far higher payment requirements for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, we have obtained the commitment appropriations that we wanted in almost all areas, but nevertheless, we cannot constantly amend the budget and top it up during the financial year as needs are identified. This is a piecemeal approach that will prevent the European Union from setting broad guidelines, particularly in terms of research, as demonstrated by the ITER case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me simply remind you that the EU budget is still a lever and that, despite the current austerity policies in Member States – which we fully understand – we do also need to make some minimum commitments. With 80% of the budget going back to citizens, the European Union budget is not a black hole, but rather a redistribution mechanism that can also be used to invest in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would also stress the fact that the Council approved Parliament’s proposal to use the sum of EUR 200 million on the basis of the flexibility instrument. This EUR 200 million was made available in response to Parliament’s concern about promoting competitiveness.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Dominik, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating my fellow Members who took part in the negotiations in conciliation with the Council on the complex task they have carried out, one that had to take into account the austerity period and the budgetary difficulties faced by the Member States, which are already under severe pressure.</p>
      <p sl="it">The outcome of the negotiations can be described as positive as far as the priorities established by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are concerned. I refer, in particular, to Heading 1a, a key heading for the development and growth of European businesses and the implementation of human capital, where the agreement on the Seventh Framework Programme for the Lifelong Learning Programme and for Erasmus Mundus has been upheld.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I cannot accept the fact that, for the second year in a row, the Council has dug its heels in and made horizontal cuts across all budget lines. A 1.86% increase in payment appropriations over the 2011 figure goes against the economic recovery line that the Commission proposed and which this Parliament very much wanted. Focusing on priorities at a time of austerity is surely a winning strategy, but what transpires from the conciliation is a worrying disparity between the commitments made and the appropriations actually granted.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, Mr President, this result is liable to undermine public confidence in the possibility of our getting through this period of serious economic and social difficulty together, at European level, and within an acceptable time frame.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, I would like to congratulate everyone on drawing up this budget, which is a good model for the Member States to follow. In the case of payments, we should always make a comparison with the average payments made by the Member States. With regard to commitments, we should call on the Member States not to exceed the upper limits which we impose on ourselves. It should also be possible to introduce an automatic mechanism into the negotiations to ensure that the restrictions on getting too heavily into debt which we apply to ourselves at a European level are supported voluntarily by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would specifically like to thank the Commission for allowing Ms Kroes to take over responsibility for the Erasmus for Journalists programme which we introduced last year as a preparatory action. In the context of this programme, journalists can acquire a new understanding in the different capital cities and in many other areas of the European Union of how European policy is implemented by the Member States and by the television companies, the newspapers and the social networks. This is an important opportunity for us to bring journalists closer to the real Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also pleased that there is further support for the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme. This will generate new jobs and new employment opportunities. The implementation of the programme, which helps entrepreneurs to make contact with suppliers and customers, will establish networks that will benefit all of us.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the Commission for promising to support the Youth Olympic Games in Innsbruck. It is very important for us all that people are brought together across national boundaries, particularly in the field of sport where achievement is the central factor.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I welcome this agreement on next year’s budget. Since there is an economic recession, it is fitting that we accept this agreement because we cannot seek too large an increase for next year, and probably for the next couple of years.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I would like to focus on two things: sea and sport.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Regarding the sea, I welcome very much the new budget line for maritime actions and particularly the proposals made by Commissioner Damanaki just a few days ago regarding the Atlantic. I think the potential for developing new jobs and growth by exploiting the resources of the sea is immense, especially in terms of renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In the Atlantic in particular, we probably have the best resources in terms of offshore wind, tidal and wave power and we need to exploit them. Undersea mining could also solve many of our difficulties regarding raw materials and, of course, offshore aquaculture is a tremendous opportunity to offset the destocking of the fish resources in the sea and guarantee healthy fish from our own waters, rather than importing them from dubious sources.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Regarding sport – and my colleague Mr Rübig mentioned many points which I agree with – one thing I would like to see in particular is an Erasmus for sport because I think there is huge potential there. We do not give enough value to the potential of sport in solving economic difficulties, and particularly health difficulties. Every day I attend hearings here with people coming looking for more and more money to do research to find cures for various health problems. The cure is very simple: prevention. That can start by having people lead active lives, healthy lives, starting at a young age.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, to begin with, I, too, would like to offer my congratulations, since reaching a compromise on the 2012 budget is undoubtedly a success, although there are still some failings, because the increase amounts to less than the inflation expected by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to highlight the part played by the Polish Presidency in reaching the compromise between the European Commission’s proposal, the European Parliament’s position and the Member States’ expectations. I would like to emphasise how happy I am that the cuts, although very stringent, did not extend to cohesion policy, which is the most development-friendly of all European policies and which promotes the maintenance of a necessary level of investment in times of crisis.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, I also agree with the many remarks that have been made concerning how our 2012 budget should be improved. For my part, I should say that the increase in commitment appropriations and payment appropriations proposed by the Council is too large. A more balanced overall budget level would be much more acceptable. There are reserves in administrative expenditure and in other regulations. Secondly, in my view, the Council’s proposal to increase budgeted expenditure under various headings at the expense of the reserves relating to those headings does not merit support. It is essential to determine an adequate level of reserves in the European Union budget; this especially concerns the headings relating to external relations and administrative expenses.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the compromise reached in conciliation is fairly satisfactory: there has been an increase in the funds to support small and medium-sized enterprises and a legitimate increase, also, in the package for FRONTEX, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders.</p>
      <p sl="it">At a time of obvious difficulty, one could not have asked for more. Indeed, I would have even preferred it if more cuts had been made to certain budget items that I do not consider essential: I am referring, for example, to the increase in the funds for cooperation with Asia and Latin America.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I think that the additional increase in the appropriations to support the Turkish Cypriot community is an outrage: I do not believe that the European Union should legitimise a population that is illegally occupying territory that does not belong to it. In any case, the increase has not placed a particularly heavy burden on the Member States, which have already been severely tested by the crisis, and this was undoubtedly the most important thing to ensure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are discussing the very modest budget for 2012, below 1% of EU GNI, despite growing responsibilities under the Lisbon Treaty and despite growing challenges which deserve a common answer. Although this budget is nominally growing, it is not growing in real terms – in real terms, it is decreasing. And we are not asking on behalf of the Commission or on behalf of Parliament; here we are starting savings. 94% of what we are asking for is for the operational expenditure of a different nature from that which is in the national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I have to respond to some speakers who notoriously accuse us of growing while others are making cuts. This is simply not true; this is true of only about four countries, which are easy to guess – Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, which are decreasing. The other national budgets of the European Union are growing, including the UK and the Dutch budgets. Despite all the savings, we have some obligations to make payments from the European budget. This is all the same, with the big difference that the European budget is always in equilibrium and cannot be blamed for the mismanagement of fiscal policy at the national level. This is mainly about investment, as clearly explained, for example, by Anne Jensen or Mr Vaughan from Wales, in the name of the stakeholders of the budget.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, of course we can hold a long debate on the level of commitment appropriations and payment appropriations, and there will always be some people who are unhappy. This is also the case with national budgets; there are always some people who are unhappy, because funds for their particular priority have not been provided to the level they would have hoped. Yet let us not forget that we face a very difficult economic situation in the European Union, and extremely serious problems in the Member States in terms of finding extra money. As I see it, however, there are two very important messages which came out of this year’s budgetary procedure, and which I think are worth emphasising at this point and keeping in mind.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, this year’s budgetary procedure confirmed that we can still talk about and resolve very difficult issues in the European Union using only the Community method. This is a very important message. In order to reach an agreement, we followed exactly the procedure provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. There was no need for any other extra-institutional measures. This is the kind of achievement we should be aiming for at the moment. We have set an example to the whole of the European Union, proving that the Community method still works.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second very important message is that despite the criticism levelled at amending budget No 6 to this year’s budget, its adoption proves that the commitments undertaken by Parliament and the Council in the course of the budgetary procedure are respected. We can continue the discussion on whether to accept these 200 million or not. All those who participated in the conciliation procedure will remember that the discussion hinged on whether 200 million is, in fact, the amount needed or not, and whether at this time, while the decision is being taken, we can be sure that the budget needs exactly this specific amount and not some other amount, whether greater or smaller. That is what the discussion was about: not whether to provide the money, but how much money should be provided.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, these are two very important messages to be taken from this budgetary procedure, and we should remember them. At present, we are succeeding in implementing the EU’s provisions, the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and this is what we should focus on. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It is good news that this year, the three institutions of the European Union came to an agreement regarding the 2012 budget in time. Due to the crisis, there will be only a slight increase in payments, but I consider it important to review this decision over the next year if necessary, and remind the Member States of the promises they made.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It would be unacceptable for the lack of funds to hit hardest those who are in the most dire need. It is the very programmes under the European Social Fund that support the fight against unemployment and social cohesion which are most endangered by the depletion of funds. Governments must therefore be held accountable for adhering strictly to the Member State commitments made in order to make up for the lack of funds. At the same time, Parliament has managed to negotiate an increase in the level of longer-term financial commitments, and EU funds will therefore hopefully contribute to kick-starting the European economy and achieving our strategic goals for the period until 2020.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">For the past 23 years, World AIDS Day has been observed on 1 December. This year marks the sad anniversary of 30 years since the first case of this disease was discovered. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of scientists, it has not yet been possible to prevent effectively the spread of the HIV virus. Furthermore, research has shown that incidence of the disease has increased during the crisis. World AIDS Day is an opportunity to show our support for those living with the virus, people who are often suffering, and to remember those who lost the fight against AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Let me make the second statement. We are voting today on Croatia’s Accession Treaty. During this journey towards European membership, dialogue between our parliaments has been a driving force in moving forward an impressive number of reforms, but also in building true friendship. I was myself on an official visit to Croatia a few weeks ago and I remember the extraordinary welcome I received, and it was a welcome for all the Members of the European Parliament. It is a great pleasure and honour for me to announce that today, we welcome the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament, Mr Luka Bebić, who is present in the gallery.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">We look forward to welcoming members of the Croatian Parliament permanently in this House, first as observers and then as full Members. You, dear Speaker of the Parliament, and your colleagues, are already full members of the European family. Welcome.</p>

      <p sl="it">I believe that we need a very broad consensus to demonstrate that this Parliament is a transparent parliament, that it is concerned only with the common good, and that each one of us is personally honouring the commitment, made back at the time of the elections, to serve only the common good and European integration.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by Mr Casini, but in the committee meeting, I tabled various amendments in the – very modest, but I believe very correct – belief that they improved the text. Those amendments were not accepted because there was a discussion, which was also held at a high level, with you in attendance, and hence an agreement had already essentially been reached.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am tabling two oral amendments, one of which I consider to be very important because, as the Article states … I would like all the Members to listen to me for a moment, because I believe there is a problem … Two minutes … Do I have to speak later? May I continue?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer both to this amendment and to the next one, because I have tabled two oral amendments. I believe that this one is very timely and integral to the overall text, because the Article spells out the duties of MEPs in the text, in the introduction, but it is very muddled and actually stipulates what cannot be done, not what MEPs must do in accordance with what Mr Casini said about our transparency and our representation of the people, whom we must represent in a correct and very scrupulous manner. I believe that it is very muddled.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would place even more emphasis on the other amendment, Mr President. Since we are stipulating that MEPs must not accept gifts worth more than EUR 150, my amendment, ladies and gentlemen, was far stricter in proposing a much lower amount, because I believe that MEPs should not accept any gifts or courtesies save for those of little, or negligible, value.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the proof of this is in a letter received by all the MEPs. This letter provides for, offers MEPs EUR 100 to take part in a survey. I believe that this is an offence against …</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument highlights once more the crucial need for the EU budget to be increasingly flexible. At the same time, despite contained reinforcements in commitments on a limited number of budget items and several decreases in other budget items, the ceilings of subheading 1a and Heading 4 do not allow for adequate financing of selected priorities carried by Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence, for the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2012, the flexibility instrument shall be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 30.75 million in commitment appropriations under subheading 1a and of EUR 208.67 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 4. The mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to finance the Europe 2020 strategy will therefore require a total amount of EUR 239.42 million.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wonder where it comes from, this idea that the way to get rich is by receiving subsidies? It is not true of individuals and it is not true of nations. If it were true, Greece would now be the wealthiest country in the EU, and there would be angry, impoverished, penurious German crowds protesting about the bail-out that they were getting from Athens.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, of course, as we have seen in the European Union, the reverse is true; the effect of receiving large subsidies is in fact deleterious to your GDP. The reason for that is that among states, as among individuals, people will eventually begin to arrange their affairs around qualifying for the hand out. Just as within a nation, welfare can be debilitating to the recipient, so among nations, the same principle pertains. Excessive intervention at EU level, excessive spending, was the cause of our problem. It is not going to be the solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we approved the EU budget for 2012, agreeing to an increase in spending of 2% and this actually represented a victory for Member States and taxpayers over this Parliament and the Commission. Hard though it is to believe, the Commission called for an increase of 4.3% and the Parliament wanted an increase of 5.3% – this at a time when national governments are having to increase taxes and cut expenditure at home.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could there be any better illustration of how detached both the Commission and this Parliament have become from the real world? In my view, even a 2% increase is too high; we should cut the EU budget and save our taxpayers’ money. Rather than asking for increases in funds, the Commission should concentrate on spending wisely the money it already receives.</p>

I welcome the deal which has been found between the Council and Parliament for next year’s budget which now reflects the reality of tough budgetary decisions being taken at national level right across Europe. The European Union has the responsibility to share the burden of the economic crisis and take part in the joint effort towards budget austerity and responsible spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, I support the 2% overall increase decided today, which is way below the original budget bid of 5% by the Commission and 5% by Parliament. It was the right thing to do.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that we can see that the European Parliament, too, has lived up to its responsibilities in this case. We have passed a budget within the necessary time frame – to that extent all is well. That is the good news.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other news, which is to say the bad news – and I, personally, am really peeved by this – is that the Member States have more and more new duties for the European Parliament and constantly pass on new functions to us, but then, when it comes to funding, the necessary funds are not handed over along with the responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="de">That will be our task for the future – there needs to be a fair negotiation, a fair deal. Additional duties for the European Parliament clearly also mean additional funding, additional financial resources. It is for that reason that I abstained from voting on this motion.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after 15 hours of constructive negotiations, the 2012 budget has been finalised with an agreed level of payment appropriations of EUR 129.08 billion, corresponding to the amount agreed by the Council in its July position. In contrast, the amount of commitment appropriations stands at EUR 147.23 billion, which is almost EUR 1 billion more than the sum in the Council’s position.</p>
      <p sl="it">When it became clear, during the negotiations, that there would be no room to negotiate on payment appropriations, given that the Member States’ delegations had illustrated the difficulties facing national budgets, the European Parliament’s approach was to focus on the level of commitments, with particular reference to competitiveness and external relations. I therefore support this 2012 budget; considering the difficult economic and financial period we are in, it has still found a far-reaching solution under the heading of competitiveness, for example, by regarding innovation and investment as being conducive to a future European recovery.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, since 2010, we have been experiencing a sovereign debt crisis, particularly in the euro area, of a kind not seen before in our recent past, and it is highlighting the weaknesses of European instruments in fighting against speculation by the so-called ‘markets’.</p>
      <p sl="es">One of the instruments at our disposal in the euro area is the European Central Bank. In my view, its political will to get the debt crisis under control and focus on growth has been sorely lacking. Firstly, in relation to growth, it has decided, unlike other central banks, not to lower interest rates, which would encourage consumption and investment and boost these within the scope of its powers. Secondly, in relation to sovereign debt, it has only acted in the secondary markets at crunch times, without being able to mobilise and use all its resources to combat speculation and help to protect our single currency, acting as a bank of last resort, yes, but not quickly or decisively enough.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are the reasons for the way we intend to vote on this report, and also for our demands about the future role of the European Central Bank.</p>

However, it is important that the evaluation methods used are made public.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, it would be appropriate for the ECB to provide better information about the funds held by the central banks in the euro area. I support the establishment of macro-prudential supervision for the financial system. It must take into account the disparities between Member States both inside and outside the euro area. However, I should point out that the bank must have a constructive and balanced attitude to all the countries in the European Union. The ECB must use the instruments available to it responsibly, including printing money.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report submitted to us today by the European Central Bank (ECB) contains information that I find deeply interesting. In 2010, the ECB earned a surplus of EUR 1 334 million; a fall compared to the previous period. Factors contributing to this fall were, firstly, the lower net interest income as a result of lower interest rates both on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations and on US dollar-denominated official foreign reserves and, secondly, the fact that no gold sales took place in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 31 December 2010, an amount of EUR 1 163 million to the risk provision, thereby increasing it to the level of its present ceiling. As a result, the ECB’s declared net profit for 2010 amounted to EUR 171 million, which the Governing Council decided to distribute in its entirety to the euro area national central banks.</p>
      <p sl="it">The purpose of the risk provision is to cover foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks. The size of, and the continuing requirement for, this provision are reviewed annually.</p>
      <p sl="it">The ECB’s regular income derives from investment earnings on its foreign reserve assets and its own funds portfolio, from interest income on its 8% share of the total euro banknotes in circulation, and from net interest income arising from securities purchased for monetary policy purposes under the covered bond purchase programme and the Securities Markets Programme.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I voted against the amendment of the accompanying measures for the banana sector as this report completely fails to take account of what was decided in the Treaty of Lisbon. This report would enable the Council to take far-reaching decisions on development policy in 10 important African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states on its own. There is neither a political nor a legal basis for denying Parliament the right to codecision in the procedure concerning the delegated acts on development policy. On the contrary, in fact, Parliament, as representative of the people, should pay particular heed to its competences so that it can help decide the conditions on which, and the purposes for which, taxpayers’ money is used in the field of development policy. In a declaration of intent for the post-2013 period, the Council agreed to give due consideration to the delegated acts. I consider that to be a disregarding of Parliament’s rights. The division of competences is clear. We should not relinquish our rights!</p>

      <p sl="it">This difference of opinion has meant that the Conciliation Committee has had to be convened together with a trialogue, which has led to four compromise proposals being drafted. In the case of the instrument with industrialised countries, the change was aimed at extending the geographical scope of programmes under the financing Instrument for Cooperation with Industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI) to encompass emerging countries that still feature amongst the beneficiaries of the existing instrument for cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The most sensitive aspect of the negotiations related to the European Parliament’s request for the text of the regulations to include specific financial allocations for countries or regions, expressed in either monetary or percentage terms.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Union is based on values such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law. These values are also enshrined in the founding Treaty, and they were strengthened by the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Union actively supports universal human rights, and defends them not only on its own territory, but also in relations with third countries. The new legal framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has the potential to improve the effectiveness and transparency of Community external assistance worldwide. We must bear in mind the fact that the directly elected European Parliament is the bearer of democratic legitimacy within the institutional framework, and it is therefore becoming an issue of principle to strengthen the position of Parliament through the use of delegated acts in the area of external relations.</p>

This includes the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the promotion of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="it">Its action plan with regard to the financing instrument for development cooperation includes providing support for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Sugar Protocol Countries, geographic assistance programmes for South Africa and 47 countries in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, and thematic programmes.</p>
      <p sl="it">On a multilateral level, the Millennium Development Goals are the main reference point, and their aim continues to be the halving of absolute poverty, or of the number of people who live on less than a dollar a day, by 2015. The European framework is an essential reference point for each Member State’s development cooperation. A third of Italy’s official development assistance is managed by the European Commission in Brussels, which explains my strong vote in favour of this measure.</p>

      <p sl="it">Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that the application of delegated powers will not impose any additional substantial financial burden on statistical respondents. Therefore, in line with the similar approach taken for the regulation on tourism statistics, the Committee on Transport and Tourism must adopt amendments aimed at limiting the scope of powers delegated to the European Commission and setting further conditions in relation to their use.

On the other hand, there are still a large number of problems in Croatia. I am thinking of, among other things, the problem of corruption. These problems must be tackled first and resolved successfully before the country is effectively allowed to join the European Union. Croatia should only be allowed to join the European Union if it fully meets all the Copenhagen criteria.</p>

      <p sl="de">Croatia’s accession on 1 July 2013 shows that the European Union continues to be a strong community, and one that is attractive to those still outside it. The result of the vote also shows that Croatia, which has had the most stringent of conditions imposed on it in recent years, has very thoroughly met them.</p>
      <p sl="de">All the same, Mr President, many citizens take the view that it is high time that we made a point of truly consistently tailoring the implementation of European law to what we actually need in Europe. Many Member States of the European Union do not meet these requirements themselves. We admit that. Nevertheless, we realise that before its accession, Croatia, too, will tinker with a few details here and there. We hope that, on 1 July 2013, Croatia will truly have met all the conditions imposed on it and become a fully-fledged member of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group’s delegation from the State of Baden-Württemberg thus decided to abstain. We see this as a positive way of calling on Croatia still to overcome the last few remaining obstacles in its path.</p>

It is, of course, necessary to continue implementing the reforms in full, particularly in the key areas of the democratic legal state.

Accession to the EU will succeed, as it has the support and commitment of the people behind it. Even after accession, Croatia will need to continue with its implementation of half-accomplished reforms, especially the reform of the judiciary and the eradication of corruption in high places.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the area of the economy, Croatia must continue with its structural reforms, improve levels of employment, revitalise the labour market, and strengthen the state economy to improve competitiveness. All this also applies to those Member States of the EU in the throes of recession.</p>

He has written several books exposing malfeasance in high places and although, of course, I do not know the circumstances exactly around his arrest, it does seem highly suspicious and it sends out a signal to all those who are challenging vested interests in Zagreb.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I visited Croatia earlier this year, I was saddened by how many of the brave and patriotic people of that beautiful country came to me and said that they saw EU membership as an antidote to domestic corruption.

The answer of the bosses and their representatives in governments across Europe is very clear. It is contained in the one word ‘austerity’. The problem that they face is that the majority of people across Europe do not agree with their solutions. The majority of people know that while the rich are getting richer, the economies of Europe are being destroyed and thrown into a downwards spiral.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this excellent report. The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted in favour of it. It is absolutely right that we have a holistic approach. I want to point out that women’s sexual health and reproductive rights are vital. There needs to be access to contraception and access to emergency contraception, as well as to safe and legal abortions where necessary. HIV prevention and awareness is vital, and therefore, the emphasis on education programmes is welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also recognise the enormous positive developments that have been made. In this respect, as I said at the beginning of the debate, we need to call on the Commission to unfreeze the funds for the global fund on AIDS and HIV. Unlike a previous British speaker, I wish to say that the promotion and defence of universal human rights are not colonialism: they are the tools and the aspirations of all civilised societies.</p>

      <p sl="it">As the statistics and a paragraph of the report on which we have voted show, there is a higher rate of infection among young men and women. A UN research project has found that, while the HIV information campaign was particularly high-profile in the 1980s, interest in this type of disease has gradually diminished, as if the danger has passed. As a result, young people today are less well informed and less aware of the risks associated with infection. Few know that a person living with HIV does not necessarily have AIDS, or that HIV is transmitted while AIDS is not, or that tests are carried out to diagnose HIV, but not AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why I am pleased that the report fulfils the task of updating a subject that still requires a great deal of discussion and explanation in order to find a global solution to the problem through increased awareness and better information.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, 33 million people are currently living with HIV, 2.5 million people are newly infected every year, and over two million people die of AIDS annually. According to Irish Aid, HIV/AIDS is likely to become the leading cause of death in the 21st century. These shocking figures underline the need for a real response to this disease and unfortunately, in some respects, we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">International financing for HIV programmes in the ex-colonial world has fallen by 10% in 2010. Even in Europe, as part of the massive cutbacks that are taking place in the public sector and in public services, cost-cutting measures have been introduced in relation to antiretroviral drugs, a move which, in reality, puts people’s lives at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">Important research has been conducted and important steps forward have been made in terms of increasing access to antiretroviral drugs with generic medicines and patent pills, but it is still not enough. The existence of patents that protect the pharmaceutical industry often means that those who need these drugs do not get access to them. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry needs to be nationalised and run democratically in the interest of people not profit, and this needs to be accompanied by a substantial increase in internationally coordinated patent-free research to guarantee progress and access to improved HIV/AIDS drugs for all.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I voted against the report on HIV and AIDS, but not because I am opposed to people infected with HIV or AIDS being able to receive the best possible care or to more funding being set aside for drug development. What I am opposed to is things creeping into such a report that, in fact, have nothing to do with the actual subject. I am referring here, for example, to recital 22, which calls – and I quote – for ‘safe and legal abortion’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Well, the European Union should not be meddling in these kinds of matters. This is a matter for the Member States, and if there are Member States that want abortion to remain illegal, then that should be perfectly possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report rightly calls for respect for rights, including the right to privacy of those who have been infected, but it fails to address the question of how people who have to deal with those infected with the virus, such as doctors, dentists and nurses, can be protected if they are never made aware that one of their patients has been infected. This is a sensitive issue, but it is also a problem that urgently needs to be discussed. We should also be able to protect society at large.</p>

The EU 2020 strategy is one of the instruments created to address the current difficult period of economic crisis and the lack of confidence we are seeing in Europe both at an institutional level and among the citizens. Mobilisation of the fund is needed to enable these two EU instruments to drive the European strategy for growth and economic, social and political stability within the Union. The Conciliation Committee convened for the 2012 budget approved the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 200 million above the ceilings of subheading 1a and Heading 4, in order to support the neighbourhood policy and the EU 2020 strategy.

In view of the fact that help for Europe’s immediate neighbours (especially in the wake of the Arab Spring) is vital if we are to guarantee Europe’s stability, and that achieving the aims of the 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth is a top priority, I voted for the Böge report.</p>

As a result, during the work that was carried out before a common position was reached, the European Parliament decided, with the Council’s agreement, that it was vital to increase spending for 2012, in order to relaunch the economy in sectors of strategic importance for growth and to help Europe to emerge from the crisis, if it is decided, upon a proposal by the Commission, to mobilise the flexibility instrument. As we know, the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 permits the flexibility instrument to be used to finance spending that could not be financed from the maximum amounts available under one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework.

      <p sl="pt">Taking into account the interinstitutional agreement of May 2006, the European Commission is proposing to mobilise the flexibility instrument for Heading 1a of the 2012 EU budget, on competitiveness for growth and employment, and Heading 4, on the EU as a global player, since it is becoming essential to exceed the maximum limits for both headings.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The sums to be mobilised represent EUR 30.75 million for Europe 2020 strategy targets, and EUR 208.67 million for the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument. Both areas are extremely important to the EU, to differing degrees. Firstly, it is crucial to start taking the required measures and to allocate the necessary funding to transform the EU into a smart, inclusive and sustainable economy by reducing the unemployment rate, by increasing productivity, and by increasing social cohesion. To this end, there is a need to implement the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards EU foreign policy, following the revolutions of the Arab Spring, it is essential that the EU support processes of democratic transition in these countries and that it create, at the same time, the measures necessary for the economic and social development of the public, whose expectations are now extremely high.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in favour of the EU 2020 strategy and the European Neighbourhood Policy. Point 27 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management allows for the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in order to finance clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multiannual financial framework. I support the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for financing the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy under subheading 1a, and for financing the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument under Heading 4, for a total amount of EUR 239.42 million. Therefore, as part of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2012, the flexibility instrument will be mobilised to provide the sum of EUR 30.75 million in commitment appropriations in Heading 1a and EUR 208.67 million in commitment appropriations in Heading 4. I urge, as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, that the EU should attach greater importance to the Eastern Partnership and to cooperation with neighbouring EU Member States in the Danube region. The mobilisation of the flexibility instrument highlights the vital need for the EU budget to be increasingly flexible.</p>

I share Commissioner Lewandowski’s doubts, but I would like to reiterate that the possibility of adopting an amending budget at a later date, should it not be possible to meet the payments, has rightly been included in the joint statement by the Parliament and the Council. Finally, I am pleased that we have managed to honour our promises on the immigration policy appropriations. We cannot predict what repercussions the political situation in the Maghreb may have, and we must be prepared and in possession of the right tools to deal with any emergency.

      <p sl="fr">Since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force in December 2009, the European Parliament has enjoyed increased budgetary powers. Parliament and the Council now fully share these powers. After the two institutions adopted different draft budgets last October, the matter was then passed on to the Conciliation Committee for discussion, in order for the European Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement on a common draft budget. I am pleased to see that the priorities set out by Members of the European Parliament have been retained. Whilst taking the Member States’ current situation of budgetary austerity into account, we have made sure that Europe will keep its commitments to growth, employment and innovation.

      <p sl="da">The compromise on the EU budget agreed on by the majority in the European Parliament and the European Council means that the budget will increase by 1.86% in 2012 (which, in real terms, entails a reduction in the EU budget compared with 2011).</p>
      <p sl="da">The members of the Danish Socialist People’s Party in the European Parliament believe that the EU should take more initiatives at European level to create growth and jobs than it is doing at present. This requires a larger EU budget than we currently have, as well as a radical redistribution within the EU budget, shifting the focus from the massive agricultural aid and investment in unsustainable energy solutions to green growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, we are currently in a situation where many of the EU Member States are having to make enormous cuts in their national budgets, and in light of this, the Danish Socialist People’s Party acknowledges the fact that it is unreasonable to ask the Member States to increase their payments to the EU in the present circumstances. On the other hand, we cannot support a budget in which there is no serious demonstration of the will to reprioritise and, what is more, where an increase in support for nuclear power has also been agreed. We have therefore decided to abstain from the vote on the 2012 budget.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution on the EU budget for 2012 and approved the joint text agreed by the Conciliation Committee at the negotiations in November. The overall level of payment appropriations in the 2012 budget is set at EUR 129.088 billion, with commitments set at EUR 147.232 billion. Taking into account the ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts in Member States, the Council and the European Parliament have agreed on a reduction in the level of payment appropriations for 2012 as compared to the Commission’s draft budget. However, the Commission will be able to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2012 budget are insufficient to cover expenditure under subheading 1a (Competitiveness for growth and employment), subheading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment), Heading 2 (Preservation and management of natural resources), Heading 3 (Citizenship, freedom, security and justice) and Heading 4 (EU as a global player). I agree that the Europe 2020 strategy must be at the centre of the EU budgetary strategy for 2012 because these policies are vital and necessary parts of the EU strategy for economic recovery, and we must therefore ensure that they have adequate investment at both EU and national level. I also believe that the EU budget must be an instrument which helps Member States to pursue economic recovery policies, promoting and supporting national investment which would boost growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The draft 2012 budget contains some useful initiatives, such as the EUR 250 million allocated to fruit and vegetable producers, or the ‘Erasmus for all’ budget. It is a shame, however, that over the course of the negotiations, the small percentage increase in the budget that was provided for by both the Commission and Parliament in its October vote was lost. We are still a long way off devoting 1.24% of our GDPs to the EU budget. Naturally, the current climate calls more for reigning in than for increasing expenditure; however, I believe we cannot make do with a policy of austerity alone. We need to be proposing long-term plans for economic regeneration at the same time. The budget we have voted for today will not enable us to plan for economic, environmental and social regeneration. I abstained for this reason, but also because a sum of EUR 100 million (and this is merely the first in a long series) has been allocated to ITER. In my view, this research project should be conducted on a steady budget. Its budget has grown exponentially since it was launched, and from now on, ITER should be developed with the funds that are available.</p>

I think that in light of the Arab Spring, the EU needs to provide financial support to these countries in their efforts to rebuild and move towards democracy. As the Arab revolutions have shown, economic stability provides a basis for political stability, and the EU can contribute to this through granting financial aid. Last but not least, I am also pleased that this agreement contains Parliament’s proposals for funding pilot projects and preparatory activities, including a pilot project aimed at organising an event in Romania for young people involved in sport in 2013.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I abstained. As my colleague, Estelle Grelier, so rightly said, this 2012 budget is, in fact, a Council budget, with just a ‘bit of soul’ added by the European Parliament. We are not fooled by the Council’s ploy: the Member States’ main preoccupation is to impose austerity, but they will not openly admit to the impact that this choice will have on EU policies on the ground. In order to cope with the recession that European citizens are enduring, while States are having trouble funding themselves and austerity policies abound, we need an EU budget that will meet this challenge at the very least, and allow us to implement policies for regeneration.

      <p sl="it">The work carried out at the conciliation table by the European Parliament delegation is both praiseworthy and positive. The financial conditions of Member States meant that no more could have been achieved. Yet difficult times like these require the will and the courage to make innovative political choices that in some ways represent a break with the past. The conservatism of some Member States (especially, but not only Germany) is dangerously slowing down the process leading to the introduction of measures which, conversely, increasingly appear to be both urgent and unavoidable. At the same time as the budget lines were being approved, not without difficulty, the Commission was beginning consultations about the eurobonds, which were met with a negative reaction by some national governments. However, eurobonds are just part of the possible solution. In the 2012 budget, the evident widening of the gap between commitments for appropriations and payments is symptomatic of how the current system of delivering EU resources is inefficient and inadequate, and that it is therefore time it was changed to reflect an actual system of own resources based not only on the tax on financial transactions (TFT) and a new value-added tax (VAT), but also on a new way of taxing energy sources.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At this extremely serious point in the life of the European Union through which we are living, when divergence within the euro area and a lack of growth and jobs are threatening to destroy the single currency itself, this European budget should send a message of confidence to the public, at least in symbolic terms, and constitute a stimulus – even a limited one – for the relaunch of the economy, compensating for the multitude of recessive policies imposed by various Member States. There was a need for a strategic strengthening to promote territorial and social cohesion within the Union, thereby relaunching public confidence in the European project. I am voting against because of the lack of this message.

Further cuts are now being added to the failings of the previous draft budget, meaning that the 2012 EU budget is now below 1% of gross national income, at 0.98%. The EUR 129.088 billion in payments will represent a decrease in the EU budget in real terms. What we have here, therefore, is a clear surrender to the impositions of the most powerful countries and the interests that they advocate, at the expense of the countries with weaker economies, passing on to the latter the economic and social costs of the policies that led to the crisis. These are policies and measures central to the European process of capitalist integration, and they have been reinforcing these rather than reversing them, as was necessary. As such, the much vaunted economic and social cohesion is proving to be a big lie. It is a lie that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – the same people who voted for this budget – have been peddling as propaganda.</p>

Agreement was reached between the European Parliament and the Council on 18 November, following a conciliation meeting that lasted over 16.5 hours. I would stress that Parliament’s priorities regarding promotion of economic growth and young people were considered. With a view to this, subheading 1a – Competitiveness for growth and employment – has been increased to EUR 50 million above the margin, using the flexibility instrument.

In my opinion, it is justifiable for the Council to fund this strategy properly, despite the cost-cutting measures. The EU budgets for individual years form part of the seven year financial framework, which estimates how much money will be needed for EU programmes. The European Parliament's proposal for the 2012 EU budget focuses on the need to respect existing commitments and to accelerate programmes that are coming to an end. The total budget for next year will be EUR 129.1 billion (a growth of 1.86%) in payments and EUR 147.2 billion in commitments. There will be a limited increase in funding for payments, as requested by Member States, which have accepted the European Parliament’s growth priorities, such as, for example, innovation, employment, border protection and migration management and supporting the development of democracy in the Arab world. The budget headings where Parliament is requesting more growth include research and development (+8.8%) and headings covering the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds (+10.35%). These policies include as a component long-term investment projects that are now, during the fifth year of the multi-year financial framework, fully operational and within the framework of which it will now be necessary to pay invoices that the EU made a commitment to pay in the past.</p>

I think that the broad majority achieved today fully reflects the constructive spirit with which the three institutions have worked over the last three months to achieve approval of the European budget for 2012, a budget which, in my view, takes full account of the difficult time of crisis, and, at the same time, tries to stimulate investments and the economy in order to achieve smart, inclusive and sustainable development of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Particularly in the fraught times of crisis in which we find ourselves, absolutely all possibilities of savings must be exploited. This is not just because increasing the size of the budget is incomprehensible in the light of national austerity programmes, but also because next year, payments have to be made into the permanent European financial stabilisation mechanism. The money for this needs to be found from the already cash-strapped national budgets. It may well be that spending has been scheduled for many multiannual programmes and that the relevant funding cannot be cut at present because the EU would otherwise be open to accusations of breach of contract. However, there is plenty of scope available for savings. I therefore voted against this budget.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today, we approved next year’s European Union budget. Reaching an agreement on the budget is always a challenge. This is particularly the case now that the European Parliament participates actively in negotiations on the establishment of the budget and, on the other hand, given that the European Union economy does not promise increased budgetary revenues next year at either national or EU level. In terms of figures, the EU budget is increasing. However, when we factor in annual inflation, we find ourselves in the same place. It is important not to reduce the amount of money earmarked for economic growth and research – this is the only way to boost the faltering EU economy. Even so, in future, the Member States themselves should also be interested in reducing administrative costs, above all, by cutting three European Parliament jobs.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The 2012 European Union budget was undeniably shaped by the financial problems of the Member States. The EU is being hit hard by the financial crisis because it is in an economically vulnerable position. Yet now, I can gladly state that the EU institutions eventually managed to agree on the adoption of a modest, economical budget.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Currently, our principal focus should be on restoring the financial system, for which job creation, the expansion of employment, and investments that promote economic growth are indispensable.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that the adoption and implementation of a responsible budget, which must, in my opinion, be accompanied by strict economic discipline, is a prerequisite of all the aforesaid. These requirements apply not only in respect of the EU but also the individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is exemplary that with the adoption of the new Hungarian Basic Law, Hungarian budgetary law has also undergone considerable reform with a view to ensuring effective crisis management and economic upturn. It is now enshrined in constitutional provisions that Hungary functions on the basis of the principle of balanced, transparent and sustainable budgetary management. Responsibility for the implementation of this principle rests primarily with the Hungarian Parliament and the government.</p>

The Commission has therefore proposed various ‘draft amending budgets’ for the 2011 budget.

The draft amending budget on the agenda for this part-session covered the European Social Fund, the programme to support the development of an integrated maritime policy, and EU aid for Palestine.

      <p sl="pt">The specific purpose of this amending budget is to ensure that the EU will meet its commitments as regards cohesion policy. In order to meet commitments already made, the Commission estimates that the European Social Fund needs a further EUR 1.5 billion for 2011, while another EUR 142 million is required for research. The Commission has tabled amending budget No 6/2011 in order to tackle this need for EUR 1.642 billion by redeploying funds, so it remains within the margins of the budget. In Heading 1, EUR 697 million has been found, and EUR 395 million has been found in Heading 2, more specifically, in rural development. There is, therefore, a EUR 550 million shortfall. That is why there is a need for this amending budget. However, the Member States do not agree with these sums and have approved only EUR 200 million for this purpose; even so, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands voted against. There is no record of the Council calling into question the figures tabled by the Commission.

We consider this increase in appropriations important and welcome, and believe it is a potential contribution to the peace process in the situation currently faced by the Palestinian people. The increase in this budget heading is accompanied by the necessary appropriation for the banana accompanying measures (BAMs). In both cases, the necessary funds are obtained by redeploying unused appropriations under the Macro-Financial Assistance.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In accordance with Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1150/2000 of May 2000, the Commission has revised the estimates of own resources. This applies mainly to the balances for VAT and gross domestic product (GDP), as well as to traditional own resources. As far as the integrated maritime policy is concerned, it was funded for the first three years after its establishment in December 2007 via pilot projects and preparatory actions. In September 2010, the Commission submitted a draft regulation aimed at continuing its funding up to the end of the current financial framework. The proposed funding will enable the Commission to continue developing and determining the options for implementation of the integrated maritime policy, in accordance with the instructions set out in the progress report. The administrative reform in Greece is of fundamental significance for the successful implementation of cohesion policy through the Structural Funds. The aim of the administrative reform operational programme is to introduce reforms that will improve specific important operations of the Greek state, the functioning of the public administration and the efficiency of public services. From the analysis of needs relating to the committed budgetary commitments up to the end of the year, it emerges that there is EUR 60.4 million available in Heading 4 ‘The EU as a global actor’.

Instead of prioritising investment in green technologies, the budget allocates a disproportionate amount of funding to nuclear energy vis-à-vis safe and sustainable energy technologies, like renewables and energy efficiency. All of this ignores the ticking budgetary time bomb that is the ITER nuclear fusion project. Despite the blind focus on cutbacks across the budget, the Council is still insisting that the ballooning costs for ITER are met under the EU budget. Instead, with nuclear fusion a technology that will not be commercially viable before 2050, if ever, the Council should finally give up on pouring public funds into this hugely expensive white elephant.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of significant changes in the structure of international trade, and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market. Since 1 May 2009, the remit of the EGF has been expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the economic, financial and social crisis. At a time of severe crisis, one of the principal consequences of which is an increase in unemployment, the EU needs to use all the means at its disposal to respond, particularly with regard to providing support for those who find themselves without a job from one day to the next. That is why I voted for this report concerning the mobilisation of EUR 1.5 million from the EGF for Portugal, with the objective of supporting the workers made redundant from the companies Kromberg &amp; Schubert and Lear and Leoni, which operated in the automotive sector in the country’s Norte and Centro regions.</p>

The EGF will help workers find new jobs or train them to learn relevant skills geared towards the current needs of the labour market. This fund has not been used to its full extent due to the bureaucratic difficulties involved in its mobilisation. Currently, the EGF can be improved through the following measures: improved procedural and budgetary plans to make mobilisation faster, allowing the EGF to provide individual support for workers who have suffered due to globalisation, and the creation of a specific budget line for EGF.

This is yet another consequence of the structural policies of the EU, and of the successive Portuguese governments that have promoted the dismantling of significant aspects of the country’s industrial sector, thus leaving it more exposed to the free will of multinationals, which act solely in accordance with an old, natural, well known and single criterion: the maximisation of profits.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is regrettable that the European Commission has not taken all the measures necessary to defend these jobs, as we advocated several times, by taking measures to put a stop to the veritable ‘nomad’ strategy of these multinationals.

The redundancies were made in the period between 1 July 2010 and 1 April 2011 in two contiguous regions, Norte and Centro.

      <p sl="sk">The judge at the Piraeus Court of First Instance, Section 7, has requested the waiver of the immunity of Georgios Toussas, Member of the European Parliament, in order to enable him to conduct criminal proceedings started as a result of instructions issued by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Piraeus Magistrates’ Court. Mr Toussas, together with eight other persons, is charged with knowingly defrauding for the benefit of another party, by a sum in excess of EUR 147 000, the property of the Merchant Seamen’s Fund (NAT), a legal entity under public law, the management of which he was entrusted with. The alleged fraud was committed by Mr Toussas when acting as a member of NAT’s Board, having, as such, a status of employee within the meaning of Greek criminal law. In the course of his hearing by the Committee on Legal Affairs on 10 October 2011, Mr Toussas indicated that the criminal proceedings possibly constitute a political persecution directed against him. After reviewing all of the facts, and pursuant to Rule 6 paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Legal Affairs, having examined the reasons for and against waiving the Member’s immunity, recommends that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of Georgios Toussas.</p>

      <p sl="el">The waiver of parliamentary immunity of the Greek Communist Party MEP Georgios Toussas, at the request of the Piraeus Public Prosecutor’s Office because, as a member of the management board of the Merchant Seamen’s Fund and representative of seafarers, he – together with the other members of the management board – allegedly voted unanimously on 27 March 2003 to issue a certificate of no debt to Mare Naftiliaki, which had won the auction for the Dimitris Moiras and had debts to the Merchant Seaman’s Fund, is a distortion of the truth and an attempt to exonerate the real parties responsible for the bankruptcy of the Merchant Seamen’s Fund and the workers’ insurance funds; namely, shipowners, the long-standing policy of the PASOK and New Democracy governments and the EU. The request by the Piraeus Public Prosecutor’s Office for waiver of immunity is bereft of any legal or moral basis, based on the facts and the clear position of the management board of the Merchant Seamen’s Fund. The minutes of the relevant meetings of the management board of the Merchant Seamen’s Fund prove that Georgios Toussas, as the representative of the Hellenic Association of Merchant Fleet Engineers expressing the positions of the class-based seafarers’ movement, not only did not agree at the Merchant Seamen’s Fund board meeting to grant a certificate of no debt; on the contrary, he sought full security and payment of insurance contributions to the fund. The Greek Communist Party MEP has already been tried – on 16 October 2007, together with other trade unionists – by the Piraeus Lower Criminal Court, for strike action by the class-based seafarers’ associations and he was acquitted when the flimsy bill of indictment collapsed.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Mr Rapkay, concerns the request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of the Italian Member of the European Parliament, Mr de Magistris. Mr de Magistris, elected Member of the European Parliament in 2009, has been summoned to appear before the Court of Naples following a charge brought by the Naples company, Bagnolifutura SpA, accusing the Member of denigrating the reputation it has with markets, banks, public authorities and suppliers. Bagnolifutura SpA accuses the Member of putting press releases on his website accusing the company of delays and wasting public money, of passiveness and inefficiency, and of being involved in conduct that he categorises as ‘a mixture of politics and criminality’. Mr de Magistris has defended himself by arguing that he disseminated information relating to a written question submitted to the European Commission on irregularities noted by the Commission, as well as on the alleged waste of public funds. Given that the facts of the case demonstrate that the details published ‘have a direct and obvious connection with Luigi de Magistris’s performance of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament’, and in view of Article 8 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union, I am voting in favour of defending the privileges and immunities of Mr de Magistris.</p>

      <p sl="sk">A Member of the European Parliament, Luigi de Magistris, has requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity, a request that relates to a writ of summons filed against him before the Court of Naples on behalf of Bagnolifutura SpA, a company domiciled in Naples engaged in design and in soil remediation, in connection with press releases issued by him and published on his website. According to the writ of summons, statements made in those press releases constitute libel, resulting in a claim for damages. In those press releases, Luigi de Magistris published information relating to a follow-up written question to the European Commission, in which he asked for additional details concerning public procurement irregularities noted in May 2009 by the Commission. He asked for more details about an alleged waste of public funds in the area of Naples where Bagnolifutura conducts its business. The facts of the case, as presented in the writ of summons and in Luigi de Magistris’s written submissions to the Committee on Legal Affairs, indicate that the statements made do have a direct and obvious connection with Luigi de Magistris’s performance of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament. At the same time, however, as Luigi de Magistris was acting within the framework of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament in publishing the press releases in question, Parliament has decided to defend his immunity and privileges.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards repayable assistance and financial engineering. The proposal provides for a definition of reimbursable grant as a direct financial contribution by way of donation which can be totally or partially reimbursable without interest. It states that the Structural Funds may finance expenditure in respect of an operation comprising contributions to support repayable assistance. Moreover, it clarifies that the assistance repaid to the body providing the assistance or to another competent public authority of the Member State must be kept in a separate account and reused for the same purpose or in line with the objectives of the operational programme. Legal clarity and certainty should be ensured as regards repayable assistance and financial engineering instruments. I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that appropriate monitoring of financial engineering instruments is necessary, but that the Member States should not be subject to new additional reporting obligations. The amendments tabled by the European Parliament are aimed at clarifying the text, adding the definition of credit line, modifying the reporting requirements, and clarifying the obligations as regards statements of expenditure.</p>

      <p sl="it">I offer my congratulations for the excellent and complex work carried out by the rapporteur, for which I voted. During the 2000-2006 programming period, Member States established forms of assistance, identified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, by setting up specific funds and through repayable assistance delivered via other instruments. Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 does not define whether assistance is actually repayable or non-repayable and contains rather narrow forms of financial engineering. Although repayable assistance does not appear to be covered by the regulation, Member States continued to use repayable forms of assistance, mindful of the positive experience of the past programming period. I agree with the spirit of the report, which aims to provide clarity about the legality of an existing legal practice.

      <p sl="en">This proposal discusses amendments made to a Council regulation regarding repayable assistance and financial engineering. Member States have had great success with repayable assistance schemes from 2000 to 2006 and have now started implementing these repayable assistance schemes in the programming for 2007-2013. In July of 2006, Council Regulation No 1083/2006 gave the general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation 1260/1999. These provisions laid out the rules for financial assistance, but the repayable assistance plans in the form of reimbursement grants and credit lines that Member States adopted were not completely covered by the provisions of Regulation No 1083/2006. I thus agree with the rapporteur in that it is necessary in accordance with Article II of Council Regulation No 1081/2006 to make amendments that allow Structural Funds to cofinance repayable assistance. Such amendments need to include the following provisions: the financial resources used during repayable assistance must be reimbursed by beneficiaries, enhanced transparency and more efficient execution of financial engineering resources, and making clear that provisions on major projects are not applicable for repayable assistance.</p>

      <p sl="it">Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 does not define whether the financial assistance granted by Member States to beneficiaries is repayable or non-repayable, and there are also doubts about the eligibility of some types of support to be provided. This is an interesting fact if we think that assistance to Member States has continued to take the form of non-repayable assistance over the years. In August 2011, the European Commission tabled a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 with regard to repayable assistance and financial engineering, clarifying the eligibility of partially repayable assistance and the definition of mandatory reporting obligations in the area of financial instruments. I agree and I believe this report is positive because I hope that, remaining with the repayable type of assistance, Member States will grant assistance to various entities, in order to be able to use the Structural Funds, more than once if necessary, throughout the programming period.</p>

      <p sl="it">The need to introduce a framework of legal certainty that would oversee a common practice, in other words, the use of a financial instrument which was included in the previous general regulation and not in Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and which has continued to play an important part in the management of unit trusts, is in response to clear evidence of its functionality. It is no coincidence that Member States have continued to use them, even in the absence of clear indications. It was therefore certainly urgent to clarify and increase the transparency of procedures. However, we wish to express particular support for the provision for re-use of the reimbursed assistance, which would be managed in a separate account and used for the same purposes. This instrument would guarantee suitable and effective reinvestment of the funds, and could also be a way to alleviate pressure on cofinancing by Member States. Overall, the granting of repayable funds and the setting up of a special credit line for individual beneficiaries to use both seem to be moving towards an expansion of the range of funding possibilities, which is all the more important at a time of serious financial difficulty for many Member States. For this reason, I have to support this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">My colleague, Ms Hübner, has submitted a report to us on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards repayable assistance and financial engineering. Good administrative and financial practices, when they promote results in terms of excellence, should lead to the adoption of innovative methods that reform legislation which, while adopted with the best of intentions, does not always, in practice, meet the objectives that governed its creation. The Commission proposal in question aims, following statements by the European Court of Auditors, to make ‘the legality of an existing legal practice’ explicit in the context of the 2000-2006 programming period, in line with Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 but in breach of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. It is therefore crucial that the financial engineering instruments covered by the new regulation include the repayable assistance that has previously shown itself to be extremely positive in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report concerns the amendment of a regulation which makes no provision for whether or not assistance from the Structural Funds may or may not be refundable. This amendment introduces the concept of the ‘reimbursable grant’, as a direct financial contribution by means of a donation which can be totally or partially reimbursable without interest. This makes it possible for the Structural Funds to finance spending on operations, including through contributions intended to fund repayable assistance, whilst also clarifying that such repayable assistance for the body awarding the aid, or to another competent public authority of the Member State, should be held in a separate account and reused for the same purposes or in line with the objectives of the operational programme.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission proposal also sets out obligations relating to adequate reporting and monitoring in the area of financial engineering instruments. The rapporteur proposes, as seems appropriate to us, to accommodate the general objectives of the Commission proposal, although she restricts additional reporting obligations for the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 identified the various forms of assistance that could be provided through Structural Fund contributions. Member States established these forms of assistance during the 2000-2006 programming period by setting up specific funds and through repayable assistance delivered via other instruments. On the other hand, Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 does not provide a definition of assistance as either repayable or non-repayable. It contains provisions for financial engineering instruments, but these provisions are rather narrowly defined. Repayable assistance does not appear to be covered by this regulation. Nonetheless, Member States continued to use repayable forms of assistance, based on positive experience from the previous programming period. It is therefore necessary to specify in Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 that the Structural Funds may cofinance repayable assistance. I also think it is important to provide clarity as to the legality of an existing legal practice. Legal clarity and certainty should be ensured as regards repayable assistance and financial engineering instruments.

The method chosen is that of a ten percentage points ‘top-up’ of the applicable cofinancing rates for the priority axes of the programmes, allowing for an increase in payments to the countries eligible. The proposed measures will be temporary, coming to an end when the Member State exits the financial assistance mechanism, but the regulation needs to be applied retroactively. I also agree with the rapporteur that the procedure of granting the top-up measures needs to be transparent, and for this purpose, that it would be useful to have appropriate reporting on the use of the increased interim payments, although this should not lead to an increase in the administrative burden.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The economic and financial crisis and the economic recession, which the world and Europe are experiencing, have led to a deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several Member States, including Portugal; this has led to a reduction in the financial resources available for funding public investments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the European Commission proposal to use cohesion policy to provide additional financial assistance for the Member States currently facing serious difficulties handling their deficit, as is the case with my country. This will enable the continued implementation of programmes that were threatened by the economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I agree with the rapporteur on the strategic importance of the retroactivity of these measures to increase the rate of cofinancing by 10%. The agreement reached seems balanced to me, establishing sunset clauses and eligibility criteria that do not harm the future multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am convinced that this amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 will play a key role in helping the Member States hit hardest by the crisis, alleviating the pressure on their national budgets and doing justice to a policy of genuine cohesion among the EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted for this report. By now, we are all aware that the peripheral debt crisis has turned into a new economic crisis in the euro area, with an extremely negative impact on the macro-economic stability and budget of Member States. The proposal of the European Commission to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (General Regulation), which provides additional financial resources in other EU Member States experiencing particular difficulties in managing their debt and public deficit, therefore aims to guarantee fiscal stability by making a slight adjustment in direction while remaining on the right track. The euro area now needs a strong political message. I hope that the next Council meeting at the EU Summit on 9 December will demonstrate the common wish of all Member States to cooperate in adopting very specific measures to overcome the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">There can be no disagreement with support for a measure which represents a real and substantial breath of fresh air for Member States with the greatest economic and financial difficulties. In the same way, there can be no opposition to backing a measure which represents an attempt to maximise the use of European funding, avoiding the risk of funds not being spent due to a lack of available funds on the part of Member States, and of a consequent further deterioration and weakening of economic and social conditions. Although limited to Member States that have had access to financial stability mechanisms, the measure should therefore be supported and approved without further ado. However, this does not mean that we should not draw attention to the fact that it is a demonstration of the failure of the stability pact and ‘six-pack’ as wished for and approved by the right-wing majority in the Commission and Parliament. More specifically, this ‘contingent’ action restricts itself to mitigating the effects, which are, by their nature, ‘structural’, of the vicious cycle created, in particular, by the failure to exclude appropriations for investments from the rigid criteria of the stability pact, also because of the failure to introduce a golden rule on investments. Stop-gap measures are welcome, provided we are aware that the strategy pursued was wrong and that corrective structural measures are urgently required.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In the light of all this, I welcome the European Commission proposal for a temporary ten percentage point increase of the cofinancing rate in the case of Member States facing particular difficulties as regards public debt and financial stability.

The enormous budgetary consolidation efforts to which they are subject and the lack of liquidity in their economies threaten to block a significant body of public investment with strong EU backing. If the EU allows this to happen, not only would those countries cease to benefit from the Union support to which they are entitled, but it would also make it hard for their economies to recover. As such, I voted for the report, because I consider the proposal to increase EU cofinancing very positive.</p>

      <p sl="pt">For a long time, the required national contribution, in addition to the restrictions imposed on public investment under the pretext of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), has been compromising the full uptake of EU funds by the very countries that are weakest and need it most. The IMF-EU programmes have been significantly exacerbating this situation, with investment – public and private – hitting historic lows. As such, this Commission proposal to increase EU cofinancing – from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund – for the countries facing the worst difficulties, with the corresponding reduction in national contributions, has been urgently needed for a long time and has come too late, regrettably.</p>

As a result, the prospects for growth and development opened up by the investment made will be reduced. This compromises the goal of cohesion. There is therefore a need for the Commission to consider the possibility of actually increasing the Union funding available to these countries beyond abolishing the irrational criteria of the SGP, by freeing up the necessary public investment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability, leading to a substantial deterioration in financial and economic conditions in several Member States. They are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, which mainly entail problems with their economic growth and financial stability and a deterioration in their deficit and debt position caused, among other things, by the international economic and financial environment. Despite the fact that important actions to counterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have already been taken, including amendments of the legislative framework, the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, the labour market and citizens is clear. Pressure on national financial resources is increasing, and the optimal use of funding, in particular from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, might help to alleviate that pressure. The crisis and the economic downturn which have seriously damaged the financial stability of several Member States necessitate a rapid response, in order to mitigate the effects on the economy as a whole. I believe it is important for Member States to receive financial assistance from the Union or from other euro area Member States in order to address serious difficulties with respect to financial stability.</p>

However, sometimes in these institutions, one hand doesn’t know what the other hand is doing. A real problem has arisen in Ireland and I presume elsewhere with regard to LEADER funding. Queries have suddenly arisen about projects costing more than EUR 200 000 and whether there is a conflict with State aid. This has caused a full stop with regard to projects that are in the pipeline and awaiting funding. State aid was never an issue before for these types of projects but now, because there is a query, everything stops. Is nobody considering all the many projects that are currently at a standstill and the knock-on effects of the entire spend? If there are queries, projects should be allowed to continue until a decision is made. I am calling for an immediate decision on this matter. There is no point voting here to give higher levels of cofunding to Member States and, at the same time, blocking LEADER projects because of new queries.</p>

It will allow six Member States – Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Romania, Hungary and Latvia – to benefit from the increase in the cofinancing rates of the Structural and Cohesion Funds temporarily and exceptionally. In line with the spirit of solidarity that lies at the heart of the European Union, these six countries experiencing problems with liquidity linked to the crisis and, indeed, difficulties in implementing programmes financed by regional funds, will be able to receive further funding from the European Commission and see a temporary reduction in their contributions. This exceptional financial assistance will, I hope, provide a response to the urgency of the situation by injecting funds into the real economy and by reviving projects that will allow these countries to face the future with peace of mind. This is a wise decision which will have no effect on the overall funding of these countries for the period 2007-2013, as the payments made for 2012 will be absorbed at a later time.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for Danuta Maria Hübner’s report on the amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 relating to financial management for certain Member States facing financial difficulties. Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland have been hardest hit by the crisis and have received financial assistance via the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), in the case of euro area countries, or via the Balance of Payments mechanism for countries outside this area. The measure that has been adopted is temporary and allows the Commission to provide a 10% top-up of the applicable cofinancing rates when the support mechanisms are being applied, with the overall funds allocated to these countries as part of the cohesion policy for the 2007-2013 period remaining unchanged. The relevant Member State submits a request to the Commission within two months of the date from which the Member State meets one of the conditions specified in the regulation. The request will detail the purpose for resorting to the derogation and will provide information about additional measures envisaged for directing the funds towards competitiveness, growth and employment, including with regard to the modification of the operational programmes. The Commission has 30 days from the date when the request was submitted to raise objections. The regulation will be applied retrospectively, and the measure will cease to be applied after the Member State leaves the support mechanism.</p>

      <p sl="en">This proposal aims to harness cohesion policy in order to provide additional financial resources to Member States such as Greece and Portugal, which face huge difficulties in managing their debts. This proposal allows for additional financial assistance through cohesion policy by allowing for a temporary ‘top-up’ increase of present cofinancing rates by up to 10%. While cohesion policy can be used as a tool to assist those Member States who are struggling to finance quality public investments, it is questionable whether this proposal is an adequate reaction to the economic and fiscal problems in the Member States concerned. In many ways, it is just as important to pay attention to the quality of the supported projects and their potential contribution to economic growth, rather than merely seeking to maximise absorption rates of Structural and Cohesion funding in the Member States concerned. Moreover, the proposed arrangement can appear unfair, in that operational programmes in Member States which managed their public finances more carefully will be subject to less favourable cofinancing conditions than those Member States such as Greece, thereby creating a perverse reward for financial irresponsibility. Given these factors, I was unable to support this proposed measure and opted to abstain.</p>

      <p sl="de">The still ongoing financial and economic crisis has extremely negative consequences for the macro-economic stability of the public finances of Member States. Budget cuts have given rise to problems realising important cohesion policy projects and form an obstacle to the necessary use of the EU’s Structural Funds. The proposed amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 is designed to enable particularly hard-hit Member States to be able to make use of EU aid for which they meet the required conditions by means of lowering the cofinancing rate. The measures are of a temporary nature, the Commission proposal being given specific definition in its final form by means of amendments. I voted in favour.</p>

With the economic crisis, however, travelling abroad has been reduced substantially and has had harsh consequences on the Canary Islands, an economy that heavily relies on tourism as a source of revenue. On 16 November 2010, Spain introduced a proposal that would allow Council Decision 2002/546/EC to be extended until December 2013.

      <p sl="pt">The report in question, by Ms Hübner, concerns the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2002/546/EC as regards its period of application, which ended on 31 December 2011. The aforementioned decision, whose legal framework is Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, provides for special support measures for the outermost regions of the EU as a means of overcoming the economic disadvantages resulting from their geographic location. The Canary Islands are among the regions considered ‘outermost’. The global economic and financial crisis has had serious repercussions on tourism in the Canary Islands and has caused a significant increase in unemployment in the region, which increased from 17.3% in 2008 to 26.2% in 2009, leading the government of Spain to request from the European Commission a two-year extension of the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC. As such, I voted in favour of extending the period of application of Decision 2002/546/EC to local products of the Canary Islands by two years; in other words, until 31 December 2013, on which date the ‘Guidelines on National Regional Aid for 2007-2013’ expire.</p>

      <p sl="en">Article 349 of the Treaty authorises the Member States of France, Spain and Portugal to provide for a difference between the taxation of local products and the taxation of products from other Member States. This was introduced on the basis of the perceived permanent handicaps that affect the economic and social conditions of these ‘outermost regions’, as they are defined in the Treaty. This report accepts the Commission’s proposal to extend the application of exemptions from and reductions in a tax known as AIEM for certain products produced locally in the Canary Islands. In line with consistent ECR policy on such Article 349 measures, I have refused to support this report in committee, on the basis that the Treaty provision grants an unfair advantage to the three Member States concerned, even though all Member States have their own peripheral regions and yet cannot benefit from such exemptions from harmonising Community provisions on VAT.</p>

      <p sl="de">EU law does not allow favourable tax treatment for local products in comparison with goods from other Member States. In November 2010, Spain made an application to the Commission for an extension to a derogation held by the Canary Islands so that the expiry date would coincide with the expiry of the ‘Guidelines on National Regional Aid for 2007-2013’. The Commission has concluded that, because of the current economic situation in the Canaries, where the slump in the tourism sector has given rise to a rapid rise in the unemployment rate (from no more than 12% to 26.2%), the derogation is appropriate. The rapporteur concurred with this view, as did I.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this important document. The European Central Bank (ECB) plays an important role in maintaining price and financial stability as well as proper liquidity in financial markets. The continuing financial crisis in the EU and the increasing lack of economic convergence in euro area countries and in countries whose currency is pegged to the euro continues to be one of the most serious problems for the single monetary policy. I believe that the European Union needs common fiscal governance, which would cover not just countries in the euro area but also those Member States whose national currency is pegged to the euro and that are directly affected by all the decisions adopted by the ECB. On more than one occasion, I have proposed setting up a European credit rating agency as a matter of urgency, which would enable us to assess the economies of the Member States objectively and independently, based on clear and transparent rating criteria. I also welcome the report’s call for the Commission to take all the steps needed to establish a European Monetary Fund so that the International Monetary Fund will not need to be involved in Europe’s credit policy, thereby reducing the Member States’ dependence on other international institutions.</p>

      <p sl="it">In the last few weeks, the risk premiums of Italy have reached historical limits on the financial markets. Although recent tensions may indicate the opposite, since 2008, the euro has been a success. Without the single currency, the global financial crisis would have been far worse for all European countries, and furthermore, Europe’s northern countries would not have recovered as quickly as they have done since 2009 through their exports-based model. The consensus today in the academic field is that without the euro, the single market and the free movement of people, which are the greatest successes of the EU, would have probably imploded. I believe, therefore, that the euro has not failed in its function in the face of a big economic and financial crisis, but rather that there has been a problem of economic governance in the euro area. Economic theory teaches us that the viability of a single currency is based on its capacity to minimise major macro-economic imbalances when they exist. It is precisely during these moments of rising tensions for the European project that our currency symbolises that the present failures in the euro area must be considered a valuable experience in order not to repeat the same mistakes.</p>

It emphasises the continued absence of budgetary governance within the European Union and expresses concern about the increasing dependence of a number of banks within the euro area on liquidity provided by the ECB in the absence of a fully functional interbank market. Furthermore, the report welcomes the decisive action taken by the ECB since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2007, and recognises that the non-standard measures taken by the institution in the field of monetary policy have proved necessary even though they must remain of a temporary nature. In order to tackle the crisis effectively, the report would like to see the introduction of ‘more integrated economic governance’ and suggests several courses of action, including the creation of a ‘European Monetary Fund’, a ‘European Ministry of Finance’ and a ‘single European Treasury’.</p>

Unfortunately, the report does not recognise the weaknesses in the statutory objectives of the ECB and sees this specific fact in a positive light. The role of the ECB needs to be changed into a role of real solidarity and support for nations and Member States. This specific ECB annual report for 2010 does not recognise that, at a crucial time, the ECB hid behind decisions to contain inflation and that this had a series of unfortunate consequences. Firstly, it failed to halt rocketing spreads; secondly, it failed to halt action by the ‘speculation mafia’ in credit rating agencies. On the contrary, it incorporated them into its charter. Thirdly, it kept interest rates high, in a period of recession, higher than in the US and higher than in Great Britain. Finally, the independence of the ECB is a very moot point, as ‘independent bankers’ are being canonised, to the point of being made prime ministers, as we have already seen in two countries. The Central Bank is being politically manipulated. Political, parliamentary control of the ECB is needed. It is for all these reasons that I voted against the report.</p>

In addition to the increasingly active approach of the ECB to managing the crisis, particularly in the summer of 2011, the report considers several scenarios to be explored by the EU, such as the creation of the European Ministry of Finance, a European Treasury and a European Monetary Fund, as well as the greater involvement of the ECB, along with the Commission and the International Monetary Fund, in countries that have been subject to intervention, among other proposals that are currently being discussed in the EU.

Recently, we have also been able to see the way in which its intervention can calm the markets. Given the crisis that the EU is experiencing, now more than ever, it is vital that we have a strong and stable euro in order to ensure that the single market and the movement of people and goods are successful. In fact, it was not the euro that failed; the failure came from the governance of the euro area, and, in particular, the breach of the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that the ECB has maintained a balanced and constructive approach, making appropriate use of the mechanisms at its disposal, including issuing money, seeking to keep markets stable and exercising supervision at macro level.

      <p sl="sk">The European Central Bank (ECB) has so far been very successful in holding the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices inflation at a level of around 2%, despite a number of shocks at the macro-financial level and fluctuating commodity prices, and at a time of low average growth in the Union in terms of GDP. However, there is concern over the impact of higher interest rates on economic growth in the euro area, as it might impede what is, in any case, a slow recovery in the euro area, particularly in the weaker economies. In accordance with Article 282 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the main aim of the ECB is to maintain price stability, which contributes to financial stability and appropriate liquidity on financial markets. On the other hand, financial instability is a serious risk for medium-term price stability, since it prevents the smooth operation of currency policy transmission mechanisms. The persistent lack of economic convergence – a situation which is actually constantly deteriorating – remains a structural problem for single currency policy in the euro area. Equally, the impact of currency policy on the different euro area Member States varies substantially, and the assumption is, based on all the evidence, that this asymmetry will further deteriorate if the ECB raises interest rates. This is because most loans are indexed with reference to short-term interest rates in many Member States. For this reason, too, common fiscal governance at Union level is vitally necessary. I firmly believe that much closer international coordination is necessary in order to increase the stability of the global currency system.</p>

I cannot deny that there were strong concerns about the risk that a budget based on austerity would not allow funding for all the programmes. However, I am pleased with the result of the increase in financial commitments for immigration. I am also satisfied with the adoption of the package of 70 pilot projects and preparatory actions, for a total of EUR 105.4 million in expenditure commitments, of which five were proposed and supported by the Italian delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (PPE). In the area of immigration, I would particularly like to mention the pilot project on unaccompanied minors, which received EUR 1 million in funding. Since the beginning of 2011, hundreds of minors who have arrived in Italy from North Africa have, in fact, disappeared, often the victims of organised crime. This pilot project will therefore help to develop reception and integration strategies and good practice in order to protect unaccompanied minors. This will protect the best interests of minors, guaranteeing proper social integration, education support and true integration.</p>

Furthermore, as the report states, action needs to be comprehensive in order to ensure that the ECB’s economic and monetary policy supports individual EU Member States, as well as the single currency, which, over the last few weeks, has been going through a difficult time and has been the subject of much debate. The recovery of the single currency and the European economy as a whole will involve important decisions by the ECB, such as the recent decision by the new governor, Mario Draghi, to cut interest rates from 1.5% to 1.25%.

Country after country, bail-out after bail-out, the debt crisis threatens to create a domino effect throughout Europe.

However, something has clearly failed and that is unmistakably due to the lack of any real economic governance. What has been missing is internal discipline in the euro area, particularly regarding compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, as, since 1999, there have been dozens of violations by many countries, and no penalties have never been levied. On account of all this, the euro area has become vulnerable to speculative attacks focused on the sovereign debt of the less efficient and competitive countries. We believe that the European Monetary Union has a duty to keep inflation under control and protect the purchasing power of the currency. In order to continue making the euro a viable project, it is necessary to build a clear framework that makes it possible to help countries with liquidity problems, but, at the same time, is able to incentivise fiscal responsibility and the sustained convergence of competitive levels between Member States.</p>

At the end of the day, the ECB is only responsible for the purchasing power stability of the euro. Its primary role is to keep inflation within the single currency zone in check. The ECB may view its purchases as being important for the stability of the capital markets. However, the reality is that the fact that the ECB has been operating in the grey area between fiscal and monetary policy has in no way pushed down the interest burden on the crisis states within the euro.

The ECB should recall its original mandate. What we need now is stability, so that those economies in the euro area that are strong are not sucked into the crisis, too. As I regard the ECB’s current approach to be errant, I voted against.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcome the European Central Bank (ECB) Annual Report for 2010. We should welcome the fact that the ECB has done its job very well, particularly at such a difficult time for the whole of Europe, when GDP growth has been low and commodity prices have been volatile. In spite of these factors, the ECB has played a decisive role by taking emergency measures to maintain market, price and financial stability, and proper liquidity in financial markets. Throughout the crisis, the ECB has taken a determined and proactive stance. However, in carrying out the functions assigned to it, the ECB must ensure that its work is more transparent. I believe that in order to eliminate the current credit rating oligopolies and promote fair competition, it is appropriate to set up a European credit rating foundation. Moreover, the Commission must make every effort to ensure that a European Monetary Fund is established and begins to function as soon as possible. Only by implementing these measures will we reduce the dependency of the Member States on other international institutions and ensure that the IMF is not involved in Europe’s future credit policy.</p>

      <p sl="el">The intervention by the ECB in the secondary bond market was undoubtedly important, but it no longer suffices. The ECB is being called upon to take action, insofar as action is necessary, in order to give the Member States access to liquidity. Yesterday’s decision by the biggest central banks in the world to relax their harsh monetary policy is another step in the same direction; however, the next few days will be crucial. The ECB has to play its part in efforts to resolve the crisis in the euro area. With the rise in borrowing rates in countries referred to as the ‘hard core’ of the euro, such as Italy, the ECB may have an appeasing function on the money markets. The report, which I supported, outlines this need and notes the importance of bolder decisions, in the hope that next year’s ECB report will contain more optimistic messages for the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Central Bank (ECB) Annual Report for 2010 concerns the difficulties that the EU has been facing for some months. It is utterly pertinent that the rapporteur points out the successes that have been achieved, in spite of recent events. Indeed, monetary union appears to have been behind the success of the single market, providing the necessary conditions for a comprehensive system of free trade. It has also allowed the introduction of mechanisms for correcting and monitoring the public finances of the Member States, despite these being weak, which seem to be the source of the current turbulence. However, although monitoring mechanisms are provided for, there is a lack of a central governance mechanism, which has led the ECB to intervene. It should be noted, for instance, that since its introduction, there have already been dozens of violations of the Stability and Growth Pact, including by France and Germany.</p>

I believe that in conjunction with the Commission, any reference on official EU documents to ratings assigned by rating agencies should be removed.

Worse still, this report welcomes the ‘constant and rigorous’ stance taken by the ECB and its successful fight against inflation. Even worse than that, the report promotes a new political role for the ECB, calling on it to broaden its activities. To my mind, the essential issue is, on the contrary, the need to place the ECB under political supervision and to force it to intervene to support the Member States, employment and social cohesion instead of the financial markets and the banks. It should therefore be allowed, in the first instance, to offer direct loans to Member States, rather than leaving them to rely on market rates. This would prevent unnecessary complications such as the current proposal to allow the ECB to lend money to the International Monetary Fund so that the latter can pass it on to the Member States. That would be the best way of combating speculation on public borrowing. In the face of mounting economic aberrations, it is more necessary than ever to supervise the European Central Bank.</p>

Without the strong single currency, the impact of the financial crisis would be considerably more dire, however – the deficit-to-GDP ratio for the United States is currently 101.1%, while the rate for Japan is as high as 212.1%. However, as has already been observed in various reports and long debates, the euro has not succeeded in establishing (self-dependent) governance of the single currency area and ensuring that budgetary discipline is maintained. In order to sustain the single currency, the rapporteur recommends building a clear framework that makes it possible to support Member States with liquidity problems. Furthermore, the rapporteur calls for the enhancement of fiscal integration through relevant transfers of sovereignty from the Member States to the EU, making this relinquishing of power out to be a middle way within which market discipline is to be combined with the imposition of budget policy constraints by the Member States. Finally, the rapporteur calls for the creation of a European Ministry of Finance and a European Treasury able to issue eurobonds in order to prevent the repeat of previous errors.

One of the five Europe 2020 headline targets indeed is to reduce the proportion of early school leavers to less than 10% and to increase the share of the younger generation with a degree or diploma or equivalent level of education to at least 40%. It is fundamental to stress that early school leaving has severe consequences for the EU’s social cohesion as it damages the career prospects, health and wellbeing of young people. A low level of education is also a key cause of poverty, negative health and social exclusion. Unfortunately, it is a matter of fact that early school leaving is particularly pronounced among children from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds and children from migrant families. The equality of opportunities and choice in education is vital for creating a fairer and inclusive society. In that regard, a fundamental role is played by the public services. Therefore, the possible public spending cuts in the education sector, on account of the economic crisis and the budgetary austerity policies, will have a terrible impact.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for Ms Honeyball’s report as I welcome the focus placed on including vulnerable groups in general education. In Romania, the school dropout rate has risen by a third in the last 10 years from 1.8% to 2.4%. This issue is exacerbated by the current economic and social crisis. The Roma community continues to be the most affected. According to studies, 4 out of 5 children who do not attend school in Romania are Roma. There are numerous causes for this situation. One of them is the difficulty families have in supporting and encouraging their children to pursue some form of education. In these circumstances, practical, structured support needs to be offered by the school, community and authorities. At the moment, one of the problems in this area is the lack of national good practices. This is why, for example, the Roma Education Centre was set up in Bihor County, which helps devise alternative educational programmes. One of the actions introduced is an informal educational programme called ‘Summer nursery’, which is aimed at eliminating the disparities between Roma and non-Roma children registering for class I in terms of pre-school preparation.

In view of this, it is crucial that this approach is centred on the student’s best interests, with a view to offering a wider choice at school, promoting mobility between the different educational streams, improving pupil-teacher ratios and reintegrating young people who have left school early into the school system.

      <p sl="fr">Early school leaving and its impact on youth employment and social exclusion are a major challenge for Europe. Ms Honeyball’s report addresses a major priority: reducing the rate of early school leaving to less than 10%. This is a major challenge. In 2009, the early school leaving rate among young people aged 18 to 24 in Europe stood at 14.4%. Most countries in the European Union have made progress in reducing the number of young people leaving school early or with low qualifications, but a great deal still remains to be done if we are to achieve this aim. I believe that the guidelines outlined in this report are extremely constructive. They include the tailoring of educational pathways and training to individual needs, early identification of and support for pupils who are at risk of leaving school early, recognition of the impact of social inequalities, the development of vocational training and better provision for disabled students. We still have to commit the funding needed to implement this. The European educational system must ensure that no young person leaves school without a solid foundation of basic skills enabling him or her to follow training courses, embark on further education or find a job.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report places much emphasis on tackling early school leaving (ESL) in specific communities such as Roma and immigrant populations. In these contexts, the rapporteur proposes specific forms of support and the adoption of measures that would allow students without identity documents to go to school. More particularly, specific measures for Roma are warmly recommended. Given the latter’s traditional custom of moving frequently, as they are nomadic, they would require special measures in order to overcome these difficulties which naturally lead to a high level of ESL within their youth population. As happens with many measures put to the vote, again a significant emphasis is being placed on these communities, which receive special treatment by the House. I do not share this position, or in general the tendency to pass legislative measures in favour of a community that does not itself show any desire to integrate, which effectively makes any action we take in its favour pointless.

      <p sl="ro">Dropping out of school is a complex issue and poses a huge challenge facing Europe. This is why the EU’s action in implementing numerous measures and instruments to provide better support to Member States in drafting efficient and effective national policies for tackling this issue is important. Furthermore, the Europe 2020 strategy outlines six headline targets for Member States, one of which is a 10% reduction in the school dropout rate by 2020. However, the previous target set in 2003 was only met by seven Member States because, at the end of 2009, the school dropout rate for all young people aged between 18 and 24 was 14.4%. High dropout rates have major social and economic implications. Dropping out of school has an adverse impact on economic growth, resulting in economic and social instability. This is why actions aimed at harnessing the energy and developing the skills of young people are crucial for the future economic and social development of Member States. It is thought that reducing the school dropout rate across Europe by just 1% would create nearly half a million additional qualified young people each year.</p>

I voted for the report whilst acknowledging the difficulty of identifying suitable policies, a problem resulting from the fact that there are no standard predictors to identify those most at risk. However, there are some social groups, identifiable by certain factors (low income, poverty, social context and family background) which need more help. Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur that there is a need to introduce effective policies, with a personalised approach, and to create solutions for reintegrating people back into the education system through ‘second chance’ schools, for example. Success in this area would have important social and economic repercussions and directly affect growth and economic stability. Reducing ESL in Europe by just one percentage point would mean almost half a million young people receiving educational qualifications every year.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The reality is that young people’s employability largely depends on their level of qualifications.

      <p sl="it">I voted for the proposal on tackling early school leaving. It is a complex phenomenon and a huge challenge facing Europe. To combat this phenomenon, it is necessary to innovate and diversify the national curriculum by extending the variety of educational options open to pupils. Offering students a wider choice at school is not only important for increasing their motivation to stay on, but also for providing them with the broad spectrum of knowledge and essential skills necessary for finding employment later. Structural reforms are important for giving young people the skills and training that they need to make a smooth transition into the world of work. These include problem solving, critically evaluating information, and communicating effectively. I believe it is important to set up ‘second chance’ or ‘alternative’ schools. These must be sensitive to the needs of individuals. I would like to stress that investing more money in combating early school leaving can have the long-term effect of preventing young people from becoming dependent on social security, thus bringing down unemployment in the EU and encouraging the recruitment of new blood to replace the old.</p>

      <p sl="it">In the European collective mentality, the image of literacy as a goal to achieve suggests areas outside the continent or, at the most, limited, peripheral areas. However, it is also a problem in ‘western’ and ‘industrialised’ areas. It is no coincidence that recent studies have shown that in Italy, 71% of the population is below the minimum comprehension threshold of an average difficulty text. Despite these statistics, no coordinated policies to tackle the problem have been found in the individual Member States, which will make it difficult to achieve the target set for 2020. It is important, in line with the European platform for tackling poverty, to underline that there is a need to coordinate the two areas of action, creating a synergy able to reverse the rate at which ‘poverty’ affects the percentages of early school leaving and, more generally, of poor school attendance. National governments, in the grip of the financial crisis, have almost all reduced educational funding. This risks boosting the vicious cycle of ‘low school attendance-unemployment’. This is why it has become so much more important for the European institutions to take action and provide support, through the targeted use of Structural Funds and implementation of alternative financial instruments.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support this report on tackling early school leaving. The current European Commission target is to reduce the rate of early school leaving to 10% or lower across the EU by 2020. We need to work to ensure equality of opportunity for children from all social, ethnic and religious backgrounds, and regardless of gender or disability. We also need more efficient early warning mechanisms and follow-up procedures put in place in response to learning difficulties which might lead to early school leaving. We should also encourage Member States to take measures to counter stereotypes which can lead pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to be steered towards vocational training courses, regardless of their potential in other areas. It is important also to develop teachers’ skills to help them deal with ‘at risk’ pupils Young people should also be involved in discussions about programmes designed to tackle early school leaving. There is a clear link between early school leaving and youth unemployment, particularly in the light of the decline of jobs in low-skilled or unskilled labour sectors in the EU. Member States must develop suitable programmes to reintegrate early school leavers into their education systems. Equally, lifelong learning should also be promoted.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report because dropping out of school is a fundamental factor contributing to unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. To be able to participate fully in society and achieve their potential as European citizens, young people must possess a broad range of knowledge and skills that are vital to their intellectual and social development. They must be able to communicate effectively, work in teams, solve complex problems, as well as critically evaluate certain information This issue is of paramount importance, especially in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy as one of the five headline targets is to reduce the school dropout rate below 10% and to ensure that at least 40% of young people have a qualification or a diploma for completing higher or an equivalent level of education. Last but not least, I advocate that the issue of young Roma requires a special approach. They must be allowed to have access to education. Additional measures are required within traditional Roma communities to resolve the problems of dropping out of school.</p>

Early school leaving has very negative consequences in both economic and social terms.

      <p sl="pt">The Europe 2020 strategy makes reducing early school leaving to 10% by 2020 a priority. In 2009, the early school leaving rate for all 18 to 24-year-olds stood at 14.4%, a figure which is still far behind that goal. As the rapporteur clearly explains, early school leaving has serious social and economic implications, as it has a negative impact on economic growth and generates economic and social instability. It is therefore imperative that the Member States develop policies for tackling early school leaving, and that they invest particularly in technical and professional training, creating close ties between schools and the labour market, so as to promote growth and competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Ms Honeyball, addresses the problem of school leaving and the measures and instruments adopted by the EU in order to assist the Member States in setting out more efficient and effective national policies to resolve this problem. In the Europe 2020 strategy, the six headline targets include the reduction of early school leaving to 10% by 2020. It should be noted that in 2009, the early school leaving rate for all 18 to 24-year-olds stood at 14.4%. This is a matter of extreme importance, as by tackling this problem, we will not only boost the self-esteem of citizens, but also improve their quality of life, thus helping to reduce poverty and the number of those who are socially excluded. Firstly, it is necessary to identify groups that are at risk, such as ethnic minorities, parents who have a low level of education, children from rural areas, as well as the causes of school leaving, such as underachievement and the factors that exacerbate it, including poverty, abuse and an unstable family background. In view of the fact that this problem requires a comprehensive approach and the mobilisation of all those involved in the process of education and teaching, I voted for this report.</p>

      <p sl="sk">A reduction in the number of early school leavers appears to be essential to achieving many of the key objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. It supports the achievement of two of them above all: arriving at so-called smart growth by improving the level of education and vocational training, and arriving at so-called inclusive growth by eliminating one of the largest risk factors of unemployment and poverty. The reasons for early school leaving vary considerably between individual countries, and within regions. I firmly believe that policies for reducing the numbers of early school leavers must be adapted to the specific situation in regions or countries, since it is impossible to achieve a common solution benefiting all Member States. Early school leaving clearly occurs more often with disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as young people with special needs, for example. Early school leaving subsequently results in social disadvantage and entails a risk of social exclusion. As early school leaving is a complex phenomenon which cannot be addressed just through education and vocational training, I believe it is essential to incorporate measures to support a reduction in the level of early school leaving into all relevant policies focusing on children and young people.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour because I believe that early school leaving (ESL) is a complex phenomenon and a huge challenge facing Europe. ESL is a contributing factor to unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. It also has severe consequences for the EU’s social cohesion, for economic growth, the European skills base and social stability, as it damages the career prospects, health and wellbeing of young people. The Europe 2020 strategy has outlined among its headline targets the need for Member States to reduce ESL to 10% by 2020. This is because the social and economic implications of high rates of ESL are stark. ESL negatively impacts on economic growth, driving economic and social instability Interventions to harness the energy and develop the skills of young people are therefore crucial. In this regard, action is necessary in the form of greater support for European instruments for qualifying, training and helping young people into the world of work.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Everything starts at school – it is where our children are given the keys to their future in educational and cultural terms. However, every year in Europe, more than six million children leave the educational system with no qualifications. Early school leaving is an important contributory factor to unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, and it presents Europe with an enormous challenge: our children are our future and we must act on their behalf. Therefore, I am delighted that our Parliament has adopted a resolution on tackling early school leaving during this plenary session. In particular, I fully support certain key provisions in this report: greater efforts to achieve a ‘personalised approach’ for every child, greater access to educational support for all pupils, better careers guidance with more exposure to entrepreneurialism, the end of separate special education for the disabled to enable those pupils to become better integrated and, finally, the creation of more second chance schools, which are excellent and very effective in terms of getting young people who have left the educational system back into the world of work and society. These are all extremely relevant provisions if we want to improve our educational systems in Europe, but the Member States still need to implement them.</p>

That is why I voted in favour of adopting this resolution, in order to call on Member States to undertake educational reforms that target those children who are most at risk of early school leaving, and who usually come from poor, marginalised or migrant families. A special effort should be made for Roma children, of whom 20% are not enrolled in school at all and 30% are early school leavers. The success of the ‘second chance schools’ programme should be boosted in order to help reintegrate early school leavers. Lastly, different learning methods could also help to reverse this trend, as could the promotion of educational pathways that reward practical skills more.</p>

      <p sl="es">I voted in favour of this report in order to send out a double message. The first one is to the EU institutions, calling on them, despite the crisis, to continue investing in education and programmes to prevent and take action against early school leaving as the most important policy for preventing inequality and social exclusion. The second message is to individuals, to tell them that they must not give up their right to education at a time like this, when Europe is redefining its role in the world, not least in economic and social terms. Having highly-qualified citizens is not just a right to be guaranteed but a moral obligation to be promoted. The European Commission has already said that within just a few years, 85% of jobs will require a high level of qualifications. The more training people have, the less unemployment there will be, with better jobs and less insecurity. Today, combating the phenomenon of children dropping out of school is the most crucial policy for helping people to find a place in the employment market. Creating cross-cutting strategies between individuals, EU institutions and the educational community is of fundamental importance in order to combat exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Roma pupils are frequently subject to low-quality education throughout the EU, often aggravated by segregated education and gypsy-only classrooms. Their difficulties in receiving quality education result in their astoundingly low educational achievements: 20% of Roma children are not enrolled in school, 30% are early school leavers and some 50% of Roma are illiterate or semi-illiterate. Local governments must take appropriate measures for the reintegration of early school leavers up to the maximum age of compulsory education and the institution must inform the parents and the local government about school-leavers. Assistance mechanisms, such as scholarships and mentoring support should be established for young Roma, to inspire them not only to obtain diplomas, but also to enrol in higher education. A system of perks should also be considered, which would increase the participation of Roma youth in such institutions and improve their qualifications. Teachers who teach underprivileged students or are employed in lagging-behind regions should be financially compensated and receive appropriate training. It is also necessary to create specific programmes targeting pre-school education and to develop semi-boarding programmes and ‘tutoring’ in schools, simultaneously targeting the adult age group with vocational training and lifelong learning programmes.</p>

For that reason, I fully support the recommendations made in this report, which highlights the need to identify and support, right from early childhood, those young people who are at high risk of leaving school early.

      <p sl="bg">I supported this resolution as tackling early school leaving is one of the measures which need to be taken to reduce unemployment, increase employment and prevent the loss of the EU’s social and economic potential. I regard it as important to work towards keeping pupils at school, as well as giving those who stopped their education early a second chance. This will allow young people to be given the opportunity to participate fully in society and will reduce the risk of social exclusion. I share the view that a greater focus is required on vulnerable groups, as well as on the population living in poorer and remote regions, as they are hit hardest by this problem. Research carried out in Bulgaria indicates that the main reasons for children dropping out of school are not associated with their reluctance to go, but with the educational and social status of their parents. Problems of this kind require enhanced coordination between the individual institutions, an improvement in educational assistance, social services and additional support for the families. I believe that providing equal opportunities and access to high-quality education to people from every group will contribute to growth in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Nowadays, in view of the low birth rate, it is vital that young people receive education to a level that enables them to find valuable and well-paid jobs in later life.

In future, this will have a positive impact on the economy, as well as improving its stability.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Teaching in schools can be adapted in such a way that pupils are eager to learn, and feel that what they are taught will be useful in later life. The use of innovative teaching solutions can have an impact on pupils’ development, which will encourage them to continue their education. Unconventional education methods, for example, dance, theatre or other forms of expression, may lead to a reduction in early school leaving. Learning in the form of entertainment will become attractive and interesting for pupils, which, in the future, may result in a smaller percentage of young people becoming disinterested in education.</p>

Structural reforms are therefore important for giving young people the skills and training that they need to make a smooth transition into the world of work It is crucial that schools encourage students’ mobility between the different educational streams, be it academic, vocational, and so on. Offering students a wider choice at school is not only important for increasing their motivation to stay on, but also for providing them with the broad spectrum of knowledge and essential skills necessary for finding employment later.</p>

      <p sl="it">Early school leaving (ESL) is one of the most urgent social problems facing the EU and Member States. Important initiatives have been introduced by the European Commission over the last few years, and recognising the problem as one of the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy shows the attention to this social plague. ESL as acknowledged in Ms Honeyball’s report is a complex phenomenon that affects all of European society and takes on different forms in different Member States. All EU and national measures need to be reinforced in order to help the most vulnerable families and ensure a high level of education for our children, foster the adoption of a personalised and inclusive approach to education starting from primary level education, encourage the sharing of responsibilities between families, school and public authorities, and improve the way people who have previously left school early are reintegrated into the education system, by developing ‘second chance’ schools, as clearly described by the rapporteur. These are the reasons I voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union’s economic recovery is closely linked to having a highly qualified workforce, which is an objective featuring in the strategy which we have committed to for the period ahead: Europe 2020. At the moment, unfortunately, a large number of young people are leaving school early, with an inadequate level of qualifications. This reduces appreciably the chances of them being successful in life, of social integration and of getting a well-paid job. What is significant is that, according to the statistics, reducing the school dropout rate by one percentage point could produce every year 1 million well-qualified young people and new opportunities for economic growth. In this respect, it is important for us to identify those measures capable of reducing the incidence of dropping out. For example, counselling could be offered to both pupils and their parents, given the influence the family environment has on pupils’ educational and social path. Extra-curricular activities organised within educational institutions also make a vital contribution. At the same time, I should point out the additional support which must be provided to people with disabilities to offer them suitable qualifications, as well as ‘second chance’ type solutions for those who have dropped out of school, but would like to continue their training.</p>

In an area made up of 27 Member States, the challenge is all the greater. It has been proven that educational qualifications (or a lack of them) are an indicator of poverty, and thousands of skilled young people are lost every year. The social and economic consequences of high rates of early school leaving are severe, as they have a negative impact on the economic growth of the Union. Education is an essential pillar of successful European integration, so defining efficient national policies to address the problem of early school leaving is crucial.

      <p sl="hu">Poor performance is one of the main reasons why pupils leave school early. I agree that a frequent reason for failure among children is that school curricula are not tailored to suit children’s age-appropriate learning needs and their socially conditioned interests. A uniform education system makes it hard to individualise school work.</p>
      <p sl="hu">An individualised approach benefits students with special educational needs or behavioural problems. In the case of such students, positive results can only be achieved with smaller class sizes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We know that teaching assistants are a great asset to both teachers and students, but are (for budgetary reasons) employed at schools only in very limited numbers. An increase in their numbers would be justified in the case of students with special educational needs because it would result in them receiving additional assistance and attention.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I support the proposal that every secondary school should set up a counselling service so as to ensure that schools not only have an educative role, but also provide pastoral care.

The problems that lead to early school leaving have their roots outside school, and must be identified and solved. That is why the report calls for redistribution measures to be put in place, such as free school meals, school books and basic sports kit, in order to reduce the impact of social inequality and combat the risk of these students being stigmatised. The report calls on the Member States to submit action plans to stem the problem of early school leaving and requests more funds for and improved access to the EU Lifelong Learning Programme, which boosts student and teacher mobility, encourages the exchange of good practices and helps to improve teaching and learning methods.

Today’s young people are tomorrow’s brains and manpower. We need to establish a system for exchanging best practices in this area, because national situations vary significantly. Combating this scourge is all the more vital because it has been proven that those with qualifications will be given priority in the near future.

      <p sl="de">High school dropout rates have considerable socio-economic consequences, for which reason the Europe 2020 strategy includes a plan to reduce this rate to 10%. Studies have shown that there are clear characteristics for those who tend not to finish their school careers. We can thus see, for example, that fewer girls (13%) than boys (17%) drop out. In addition, we can observe that children from families in which the level of education is lower are much more likely to drop out. Migrants, too, have a higher dropout rate. Nevertheless, a one-size-fits-all approach to this phenomenon is not appropriate and it certainly cannot be isolated from external influences such as poverty or abuse. It is demonstrable that early school leavers are considerably more likely to face the threat of poverty, which is due, amongst other things, to their lack of education and the associated limited access to the labour market for such people. I am voting against this report as I believe that education and schooling are issues for the nation states, issues for which there are individual solutions in each Member State.</p>

My country, Lithuania, is one of the few countries that has already achieved the target set to reduce the number of early school leavers to less than 10%. I would like to propose to other countries that they should draw from the experience of countries like Lithuania, but the education system in every country is unique, echoing specific cultural and social features. While agreeing with the resolution’s general principles, I would like to draw attention to the fact that in the area of education, more than anywhere else, we still really need to take into account the specific characteristics of each country and find individual solutions that are attractive to each one of them.

It is assumed that if we succeed in reducing the early school leaving rates by just 1% per year across Europe, this could mean we would have an additional 500 000 well-qualified young people available to the workforce. The demographic development of Europe means that it will be particularly important to integrate as many competent young people into the workforce as possible, so that they will not be forced to migrate. I do not believe that the measures proposed in the report will have the desired effect, however. The rapporteur suggests that traditional examinations should be abolished because grades depend on performance on a particular day.

I believe that by implementing appropriate measures at European Union level, it is possible to address this issue and halt the spread of poverty. Attention should be drawn to the fact that most Member States still have a fragmented and inadequately coordinated approach to tackling this problem. Above all, we need to implement certain school reforms and establish an advisory foundation for pupils. Schools must be encouraged to move away from traditional testing, so that the future prospects of an individual do not depend on their performance on one day. Assessment must be a continuous process. It is also very important for Member States to use a variety of means to continually extend educational options, take steps to innovate and diversify the national curriculum. I welcome the idea of establishing second chance schools, which would give those who leave school early the opportunity to reintegrate back into the education system and enable them to fit their education commitments around their work and family responsibilities.</p>

Greece has one of the highest rates of pupils leaving school immediately after primary education and almost the highest rate of young immigrants leaving school early (over 40%). This has important social and economic repercussions. They extend from social marginalisation of early school leavers and fewer job opportunities to a reduction in the country’s economic capabilities. It is estimated that reducing early school leavers throughout Europe by just 1% would increase the number of qualified young people by half a million year on year, with a commensurate contribution to the GDP of those countries.

As a consequence of the economic crisis, we are in ever greater danger of the gulf between the well-off and the poorly-off deepening. Low levels of education are often linked to poverty and social exclusion, where there is a danger of a continued downward spiral from one generation to the next. The situation is at its worst in families where unemployment, rather than a profession, has been handed down from the parents to the children for three generations now. Such families are to be found in many European countries already. One way to prevent exclusion is to invest in education and to pre-empt early school leaving.

      <p sl="fr">More than 6 million teenagers leave the education system with no qualifications. The Member States are all experiencing this problem, which is increasing dramatically and therefore justifies the fact that Parliament has focused on the issue by voting, this afternoon, for a resolution on early school leaving. According to recent figures, 52% of young people who leave school with no qualifications find themselves out of work, and will join the ranks of the 5.5 million young people who are unemployed. This is quite simply unacceptable and untenable in the long term if we want to maintain social cohesion and intergenerational solidarity in our Western societies. That is why we should welcome the interesting proposals set out in the Honeyball report, such as extending compulsory education from the age of 16 to 18, and setting up more ‘second chance schools’, given that a single approach does not suit all young people in schools. Reversing this trend of early school leaving cannot be achieved by decree; it requires investment in education. It is important to reassert the value of technical streams and guarantee that qualifications will entitle a person to a job. Entitlement not luck: that is the dilemma that needs to be resolved in the field of education.</p>

The text recalls one of the main goals of the Europe 2020 strategy: reducing the rate of early school leaving to less than 10% by 2020, which would have a positive impact in terms of cutting youth unemployment and improving employment rates in the EU (more than half of Europeans who left school early are currently unemployed). This goal is all the more important given that the number of jobs available for low-skilled or unskilled labour will decline even further in the coming years. The resolution also highlights a worrying situation: one young person out of every four currently has reading difficulties. It is clear, however, that reading is a vital tool for making progress in any school subject, becoming integrated into the world of work, understanding information, communicating properly and participating in cultural activities. Let us therefore go back to basics: specific measures for remedying deficiencies in reading skills are urgently required. Furthermore, we should promote early learning of new information and communication technologies (NICT), such as language technologies, which young people have the advantage of being able to master quickly.</p>

This report puts forward simple guidelines: early identification, increased support and a personalised approach. These solutions are well known, but very few Member States today have the will to implement them as a priority. The fact is that if we enable more young people to take full advantage of their education, it will raise the overall skills level and therefore increase employment opportunities. One final word on reading: the proportion of young people aged 15 who have reading difficulties has reached 24.1% in the Member States. If we have to choose a point of attack, that is it. In my view, reading is the key to all forms of knowledge, and it cannot be dispensed with.

In the face of youth unemployment affecting one in five young people, reducing early school leaving by 1% would suffice to produce 500 000 qualified young workers. Furthermore, according to recent statistics, 52% of young people who leave school without qualifications remain unemployed. In order to guarantee Europe, which is in the grip of the economic crisis and rising migration, the concrete possibility of a return to growth and social cohesion, I believe it is crucial to focus on knowledge and suitable levels of education. The reform of the education system must involve partnerships between schools and local enterprises in order to offer students a better careers service.</p>

      <p sl="it">One of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce the early school leaving rate to below 10% and increase the number of young people with a degree or diploma or equivalent level of education to at least 40%. In order to achieve this objective, Member States will have to develop ways of reintegrating early school leavers into the education system by introducing special measures, such as ‘second chance schools’ offering appropriate learning environments that will help young people to rediscover their self esteem and ability to learn. In addition, more funds need to be allocated and access to the EU’s lifelong learning programme needs to be improved. This increases pupils’ and teachers’ mobility, enhances the exchange of best practices and contributes to improving teaching and learning methods. Finally, funding allocated by the EU Structural Funds needs to be used more effectively in order to implement the measures put in place to prevent school absenteeism.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Early school leaving is a problem which affects EU Member States and jeopardises the development of a society based on knowledge and innovation, as set out in the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, namely, the flagship initiative ‘Youth on the Move’. The target of reducing early school leaving to 10% by 2020 is still far from being achieved; in 2009, the early school leaving rate for all 18 to 24-year-olds stood at 14.4%. There are many factors which lead to early school leaving, which occurs particularly in at-risk groups associated with poverty, abuse, family background, underachievement, and ethnic minorities and immigrant populations. If this problem is tackled successfully, it will lead to the reduction of intergenerational poverty and will provide economic growth in the medium and long term.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution, but rather a set of initiatives and measures, with particular focus on public policy, in order to involve the various educational actors and the local communities. More support services and careers guidance, innovative and continuous forms of assessment, the learning of critical evaluation skills, learning to learn and greater mobility can make all the difference.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the report on tackling the problem of children dropping out of school as equal opportunities and access to education are vital for the European Union’s economic and social development, regardless of social background, family economic situation, gender or disabilities. The EU’s competitiveness depends on quality and on young people having access to good-quality education. I should emphasise the link between dropping out of school and youth unemployment. More than half of the young people who had left school early in the EU were unemployed in 2009. Dropping out of school means precarious jobs, while the long-term economic and social impact of this problem poses a high risk of poverty. Tackling the problem of dropping out is an effective way of preventing social exclusion among young people. I urge Member States to invest in teacher training and in providing staff with qualifications, both in pre-school and compulsory education. I should stress that information and communications technology (ICT) can have a positive impact in an educational setting and can encourage motivation and learning. Member States should promote and increase pupils’ access to ICT and introduce training programmes for teachers. I call for additional funds and increased accessibility as regards the EU lifelong learning programme, as well as extra funds for increasing pupil and teacher mobility.</p>

We need young skilled workers to help boost the economy and need to ensure that everybody leaves school with qualifications – at the moment, around 52% of children that leave school without qualifications are jobless.

      <p sl="cs">The proportion of pupils leaving school early is currently very low in the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic, next to Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia, has long been among the four Member States with the lowest level of early school leaving, and, with a figure of 5.6%, it is also well below the EU’s target value for 2020 (the EU average in 2008 was 14.9%). In the debate on this report, I adopted a contrary position, because I do not think we will resolve the situation by developing payment-free public crèches and day-care facilities, or by Member States providing out-of-school activities and groups, as the report proposes. At the same time, I have reservations over the effect of the proposed social mapping of people who leave school early by collecting and centralising data from all Member States here in Brussels. In my opinion, rather than the gung-ho measures called for by the report, we in the Czech Republic should primarily aim to analyse the specific causes of early school leaving and to respond immediately if the situation deteriorates, in other words, if the percentage of early school leavers increases.</p>

      <p sl="de">People drop out of school early for a variety of reasons. However, their chances on the labour market have been shown to be poor and their low income levels mean that they are also at a high risk of poverty. One of the six headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy is the reduction of the early school leaver quota to 10% (by 2020), as the direct link between a high quota of early school leavers and the negative impact on economic growth is quite obvious. In order to achieve its own targets, the EU urgently needs to take effective action: schoolchildren must receive qualified guidance in their choice of careers at an early stage. Current testing procedures must themselves be reviewed and the curriculum must be brought up to date, with innovative, broadly-based elements.</p>

      <p sl="en">When Margaret Thatcher became British Prime Minister in 1979, she instructed the Department for Education to send no more than one circular (set of instructions) to schools and colleges each year. Now our educational establishments are bombarded with proposals and recommendations on almost a daily basis. As a school governor and a former local councillor, I know that we should not be telling our schools what to teach, how to teach or what targets to achieve. I certainly don’t believe that this is a job for the European Union, which is why I voted against this report. The report also includes recommendations which are idealistic, impractical and verging on the irrational. If, as the report suggests, EU Member States are to provide financial support to parents who ‘devote time and love to bringing up young children’, the next obvious step would be the establishment of an EU love police to check that all European children are receiving the necessary Brussels-sanctioned quota of affection. The report also calls for the ‘special relationship between parents and children’ to be strengthened. Is this really an area which requires EU legislation? I think not.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Apart from the issue that has dominated the discussion of this report, the fundamental question remains, although it has been put to one side in this debate. From the first reading, through to the current phase of conciliation, the discussion has centred on delegated acts and the role of Parliament in decisions that are considered to be strategic. This discussion is now at an end, as Parliament has ceded to the Council, giving up on an equal footing between the colegislators, which it had earlier asserted.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, we cannot fail to point out, as we did earlier, that the banana accompanying measures, under the financing instrument for development cooperation, do not properly take into account the interests and needs of the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States. These countries, which will be significantly affected by the liberalisation of trade with the countries of Central America, and the outermost regions of the EU, for that matter, were not properly involved in the discussion of this agreement. According to the ACP countries, the amount of aid needed to maintain their banana sector, cushioning them from the impact of this liberalisation, will be approximately EUR 500 million. Therefore, the amount proposed by the Commission, EUR 190 million, is well below the estimated cost of the impact of this agreement. It is worth remembering that in Africa alone, around 500 000 people depend on the banana sector.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As we have already said in previous discussions on this matter, the issue of delegated acts has dominated the discussion around the financing instrument for development cooperation, as in fact has happened with other financing instruments. In this case, well-founded concerns have been expressed, which we share, about a possible delay in the transfer of the funds foreseen in banana accompanying measures as a result of the current dispute between Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Without detracting from the importance of this discussion, it would nevertheless also be worthwhile to look at the underlying questions arising from the agreement for the liberalisation of the banana trade signed by the European Union. We need to remember here that the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, which will be significantly affected by this agreement, despite not being properly involved in its negotiation, estimate the amount of aid necessary to maintain their banana sector at EUR 500 million.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The amount proposed by the Commission is well below the estimated cost of the impact of this agreement. In Africa alone, approximately 500 000 people depend on the banana sector for their living. The sector is regarded as a focus of sustainable development, and this has made it possible to install health, water, energy and housing infrastructure. Free trade, to which this agreement opens the gates, will now put all that in jeopardy.</p>

This made it possible, after eight trialogues, to reach a final agreement, confirmed in writing on 24 and 26 October 2011.

      <p sl="fr">Clearly, I did not vote against this report because I am opposed to the idea of granting financial aid to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-producing countries, which have been affected by the reduction in customs duties on bananas imported from Latin American countries. On the contrary, the EUR 190 million aid package to be shared between 10 countries over four years seems to me to be quite justifiable. I am, however, very concerned by the way in which Parliament’s powers have been denied at every stage of the negotiations on this text. Even though the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon means that Parliament is now on an equal footing with the Council when it comes to overseeing the Commission’s implementing powers, the Council has demanded the right to merely inform Parliament of the implementing measures that will be taken following the adoption of this text. The Council’s refusal to allow Parliament to exercise its legitimate right of scrutiny is completely unacceptable. For the purpose of condemning this refusal, and to avoid setting a precedent in future negotiations on financing instruments, I voted against Parliament’s adoption of this text.</p>

Leaving aside the technical and financial aspects aimed at supporting the banana sector in 10 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, I rejected this report to ensure that the European Parliament’s powers are respected. After several months of tense negotiations, I am frankly disappointed that my colleagues have failed to understand what is at stake with this vote, preferring to sacrifice the rights of this House in the face of continual – and unjustifiable – threats by the Commission and the Council. While our fellow European citizens have the growing impression that democracy is labouring under the yoke of economic constraints, the European Parliament would have sent them a positive signal by strengthening the prerogatives conferred on it in 2007 and by defending those granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Parliament, being on an equal footing with the Council, makes strategic decisions regarding the financing of development cooperation, and has a democratic right of scrutiny. By adopting this report today, Parliament has relinquished those two powers, following the false rumours that have been spread and the blackmail carried out by the Commission and the Council.</p>

By applying Article 291 TFEU on strategic programming decisions, Parliament’s power of scrutiny will be more limited than it was with the comitology procedure under the old Treaty. All this is a result of the shameful blackmail by the Council, which was threatening to block the entire package of measures if Parliament rejected any one of the four texts that were voted on.

This amendment expanded the regulation to also cooperate with developing countries in Asia, Central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, as well as South Africa. However, this ICI Regulation does not provide a legal basis for financing these activities as they do not fulfil the criteria laid down by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The European Parliament made many improvements with its first and second readings of this bill in 2010 and 2011. Changes made include improvements to the EP’s programming and financing. Also, the Council and EP agreed to accept the four files (DCI, DCI/BAM, ICI+ and EIDHR) as a compromise package.

However, in view of the worsening of the crisis in Europe and the good performance of many of the countries covered by this instrument, it is even more important to ‘deepen the European Union’s relations with countries which are both developing and major partners in the world economy, such as China, Brazil and Mexico, and regions like Central Asia and the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, as well as South Africa’.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Since 2007, the EU has been rationalising its geographical cooperation with developing countries in Asia, Central Asia and Latin America, and with Iraq, Iran, Yemen and South Africa, within the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation. The EU has a strategic interest in strengthening the various links with these countries, especially in the area of economic, commercial, academic and scientific exchanges, and it therefore needs a financing instrument to enable the funding of these measures which, by nature, do not meet the conditions of official development aid. Four preparatory actions were established within the framework of budgetary procedures in 2007 and 2008 in order to fulfil this aim: commercial and scientific exchanges with India, commercial and scientific exchanges with China, cooperation with middle-income-group countries in Asia and cooperation with middle-income-group countries in Latin America. During the review of the regulation, an inconsistency was identified in provisions under which costs relating to tax, customs or other fees are exempted as ineligible. For the sake of consistency, it is necessary to bring these provisions into line with the other instruments, and for this reason, I believe that Regulation (EC) No 1934/2006 must be amended appropriately.</p>

The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) is one of the external financing instruments that is dealt with in a package. The EIDHR, together with the development cooperation instrument (DCI), are the only instruments for external action not providing an exception to the principle of the non-eligibility for EU funding of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. In all of the other instruments in this area, the funding of these costs is made possible in individual cases for the purpose of proper programme and project implementation. This flexibility is important, because the inflexible formulation of the EIDHR and DCI may make the financing of actions through external assistance very difficult. The aim of the Commission proposal is to harmonise the relevant provisions with other development assistance instruments.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of this report’s proposal, which aims to achieve more flexible financial instruments for promoting democracy and human rights worldwide. These financial instruments are important. Their adoption as a package – comprising the development cooperation instrument (DCI), the related banana accompanying measures (DCI/BAM), the industrialised countries instrument plus (ICI+) and the European instrument for democracy and human rights (EIDHR) – was essential in order to slim down the procedures for accessing these financial instruments, thereby allowing them to be managed in a unified way that also made it easier to standardise the relevant bureaucratic processes. Conciliation on a particularly delicate subject like the use of financial instruments to promote democracy and human rights worldwide is an important and tangible indicator of the European institutions’ shared desire to ensure that such instruments are used in a consistent way and that they work more effectively and with fewer problems.</p>

I have always been very critical of this instrument, because the European Union has used and continues to use the subject of human rights to pursue a policy of interference in third countries. The EU can use this instrument to finance political parties, foundations and even individual people in any third country of its choice, without any authorisation from the target country. Thus, we have seen how it has been used since 2006, the year in which it was created, to finance destabilising groups in certain countries in Latin America.</p>

A recent case of a democracy and human rights project in Afghanistan involving one of my London constituents has highlighted the need to manage such projects better and to ensure value-for-money for citizens. The EU office in Afghanistan paid my constituent EUR 70 000 to make a documentary on the plight of women who have been raped or beaten and then imprisoned under the country’s justice system. These unreasonable punishments and discrimination against women were highlighted in my constituent’s film In-Justice . And yet the EU Delegation refuses to release this film. My constituent wishes to reach an agreement with the EU Delegation in order to tell the story of these mistreated and persecuted women. I call on the EU to reach a solution so that the film can be released or return the money it has wasted to the taxpayer.</p>

In a financial framework as rigid as the one we are in, owing to the economic and financial crisis, the funds for development cooperation are not high enough to support more countries and students, or to implement measures to combat poverty and social exclusion. I am pleased that this report, for which I voted, has been adopted, so it is vital that we continue to work towards the eradication of poverty by pursuing the Millennium Development Goals and the Europe 2020 strategy.

      <p sl="en">In favour. The European Parliament declares it is ready to accept the compromise package in a spirit of compromise as the remaining duration of the current instruments is rather short. It regrets that it was not possible to further improve the text on the DCI/BAM instrument, in particular, in relation to Parliament’s role in strategic decisions where an equal footing between the colegislators is essential. The Parliament underlines that this result does not set a precedent for the future negotiations on the post-2013 external financing instruments. In line with the criteria defined in Article 290, paragraph 1, the European Parliament will insist on the use of delegated acts wherever strategic political decisions are involved on financing and programming with regard to those instruments. The delegation recommends maintaining the package approach, and that the Parliament approves the joint text at third reading.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I abstained on this report, which redefines the regulation on the use of financing instruments for development cooperation. I am generally opposed to paying out these funds, which are often used as a weapon in our relationships with developing countries and their citizens. Moreover, this report makes little progress with regard to the European Parliament’s role in defining the objectives which will underpin the use of the resources thus mobilised. However, I voted in favour of two other reports, which give a more precise idea of how these funds will be used: the report by Kinga Gál and Barbara Lochbihler, which focuses on promoting democracy and human rights, and the one by my colleague and friend, Helmut Scholz, which deals with cooperation with industrialised countries. With these two reports, the European Parliament has gained a more substantial right of scrutiny. This democratic progress is, in itself, positive. It must be used to refocus these instruments on cooperation that is genuinely based on the values of democracy, solidarity and respect for differences, particularly cultural differences.</p>

In the interests of fulfilling the roles published by the Commission in connection with the common transport policy, it is appropriate for the Commission to have available comparable, reliable, harmonised, regular and comprehensive statistical data on the scope and development of the carriage of goods by road performed by vehicles registered in the Union, and on the level of use of the vehicles providing this transport. It is necessary to compile comprehensive regional statistics on the carriage of goods and the journeys of vehicles. At the same time, however, the scope of the powers delegated to the Commission should not be too wide.

Since 2004, with the enlargement of the EU by 10 countries including Poland, the Kaliningrad region has become a de facto Russian enclave within the EU, which has brought about a profound change in living conditions for local citizens. The initiatives put into action have so far not led to a significant reduction in the marginalisation of the inhabitants of the region in question and the region itself; there was therefore an objective need to remedy this situation. I therefore agree that it is worthwhile amending the regulation on local border traffic. This would prevent the fragmentation of the region into various different districts and thereby enable the inhabitants of the region to enjoy facilitations for local border traffic.

Member States can therefore allow people who live in border areas to enter the Union with just a local border permit, without needing to present any other documents, such as a visa. Poland and the Russian Federation put forward an amendment to the regulation in light of the special circumstances in the Kaliningrad region. Here, a region with around one million inhabitants that is totally surrounded by the EU except for the Baltic Sea is artificially divided into three districts: one subject to a local border traffic agreement with Poland, one to an agreement with Lithuania and one not subject to any agreement.

The Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation lies within this Schengen region as a result of the EU enlargement in 2004 and since then, it has lost all of its previous ties with its neighbours. There have been many regulations easing the border and travel restrictions between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia; however, such initiatives have not been successful. Due to this situation, Kaliningrad and Poland have both called for amendments to be made to the local border traffic regulations in order to make the entire Kaliningrad region a single border area. I support the rapporteur and believe that this amendment will allow for improved regional cooperation. Furthermore, this move will also benefit Poland’s tourism sector since the amendment will allow for easier access to local border traffic permits.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Kaliningrad region is distinguished by a very specific geographical situation, as it became an enclave within the EU following EU enlargement in 2004, and having become totally surrounded by two EU Member States. It is therefore hugely important in terms of cooperation and exchange in the Baltic Sea area, so it is vital to ensure that EU borders do not act as a barrier to economic, regional, social and cultural cooperation with those neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">An agreement from 2007 already exists between the EU and Russia on facilitating the issuance of visas, while the local border traffic regulation provides more facilities that fit better with the specific needs for regular or even everyday travel of the people who live in a border area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that this proposal is essential in view of cross-border cooperation developed under the European Neighbourhood Policy, and that it will undoubtedly help to promote the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, in addition to improving neighbourly relations between the two parties. However, it should be made clear that this was a unique solution found to the exceptional situation of the Kaliningrad region, and should in no way, therefore, serve as a precedent.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The area that is currently the Kaliningrad region, part of what was once East Prussia, is a Russian enclave within the European Union. In order to prevent the population from becoming isolated, it is proposed to facilitate the movement of its residents through the derogation of certain rules set out in the Schengen Borders Code, amending Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 for this purpose, and allowing their access to the neighbouring Polish regions. The unusual situation of this Russian region would appear to justify the exceptional nature of these measures and encourage dialogue with one of the EU’s most important partners, so I voted for their adoption.</p>

      <p sl="pt">One of the main triumphs in the history of Europe has been the Schengen Agreement, which, by abolishing checks at the internal borders, made the free movement of people possible in the territory of signatory countries and promoted trade and tourism. However, this freedom of movement brought with it major responsibilities for these countries and compelled them to be connected in an effective way. The success of this agreement has been such that some countries that do not belong to the European Union have signed this agreement. A regulation called the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) was approved in order to regulate the monitoring of people crossing external borders. The small province of Kaliningrad, in the Russian Federation, is fully surrounded by two Member States, and since EU enlargement in 2004, has been the only enclave in the EU, so it should be classified as a local border traffic area under the SBC. This situation will help to foster the strategic partnership between the EU and the Russian Federation. I am therefore voting for the report presented by Mr Triantaphyllides on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006, and I welcome the inclusion of the Kaliningrad region and certain Polish administrative districts in the border area set out in the Schengen Agreement.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In December 2006, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States, which enables Member States to derogate from the general rules on border checks, including the visa requirement, the need to provide evidence of sufficient means of subsistence and the need to prove the purpose of the visit. The aim is to avoid the creation of obstacles preventing commercial, social and cultural exchanges or regional cooperation with neighbours. In implementing the local border traffic regime, a Member State may conclude bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries aimed at addressing specific needs in relation to their respective neighbours. Ties between the Kaliningrad region and its neighbours were greatly circumscribed particularly as a result of the expansion of the Union in 2004. There have been a number of EU initiatives in the past which facilitated the movement of Kaliningrad residents, but these proved to be insufficient given the specific geographical situation of the enclave. Poland and the Russian Federation are therefore requesting a change to the regulation to take account of the specific situation of this region. The European Commission is inclined to take a positive view, as long as this only involves the resolution of an isolated situation. In my opinion, it is also desirable for Poland to adopt the necessary measures to ensure greater ease of movement and prevent unnecessary complications that would hinder this movement and would introduce new barriers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of adopting the report, since as a Pole and as a member of the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, I am delighted by the announcement that there will be visa-free traffic over the border for the inhabitants of the Russian Kaliningrad Region and the Polish border areas. This is an achievement for my country, for the European Union as a whole, and, at the same time, also for Russia, in the spirit of opening ourselves up freely to each other for a better future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is not politicians who shape border contacts, but the open flow of ordinary citizens. With them comes economic and intellectual potential, which gives rise to the multifaceted development of border areas, ranging from tourism, through business, to culture. This is the reason for the great interest in my country in visa-free travel to Kaliningrad and the strong desire to include additional areas.</p>

One of the ideas behind the European Union is the free movement of persons, which is meant to promote relationships among people, as well as commercial and intellectual exchanges. Therefore, instead of setting up barriers, we should circumvent them. The Kaliningrad region is a unique enclave and, prior to the accession of Poland and Lithuania to the EU, the residents of border areas maintained close contacts in various spheres of life. It is understandable that we want to protect the Union’s external border; however, one should also take into account the exceptional nature of this situation, as in the case of Romania and Moldova or Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine. Special procedures for visa-free local traffic would enable the free development of trade and make life easier for the inhabitants of these areas, who have been deprived of the relationships they had built over many years. The statistics provide clear proof of how much this is needed.</p>

      <p sl="en">The people of Kaliningrad should enjoy as much freedom to travel to the EU as is appropriate according to the rules on the Schengen area. This Kaliningrad oblast has almost one million inhabitants, which creates problems on its own as regards abolishing standard border controls. The creation of the exception to the general Schengen rules only for Kaliningrad is a step that requires sincere and deep cooperation by the Russian Federation and the EU. Such cooperation is now diminishing, in light of Russia opening a new anti-missile radar station in Kaliningrad, as well as suggestions about possible withdrawal from the New Start Treaty and deployment of tactical missiles to the Kaliningrad area.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these steps do not increase the mutual trust that is a prerequisite for any exception to the general rules on the Schengen area and checks on the external border of the EU. Therefore, while supporting the general idea of facilitating local border traffic from and to Kaliningrad, it seems appropriate to postpone the decision on this measure until mutual trust and cooperation as regards Kaliningrad are built between the Russian Federation and the EU and its Member States.</p>

I hope that in response, the Russian Federation will strengthen cooperation with relevant EU Member States in areas such as combating organised crime and smuggling (particularly cigarettes produced in the Kaliningrad region and fuel), so that finally, we can anticipate cooperation as regards plans to construct nuclear power plants in the Kaliningrad region and progress in joint projects such as the Nemunas Euroregion. I would also like to remind you that the Kaliningrad region plays a special role in Russian military strategy. While I know that this is a prelude to larger scale decisions, I would point out that a visa waiver is not an EU obligation but a decision based on the progress and reforms made by the country requesting it, which would enable it to be introduced safely. I find it hard to imagine that visa requirements can be lifted in relation to a country whose state structures protect people who are guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as is the case with Mikhail Golovatov, nor at a time when Russia refuses to cooperate in such categories of cases as those that took place on 13 January and the Medininkai killings.

This derogation from the regulation is based on the desire to ensure good relations between peoples, without centuries-old economic, social and cultural ties between the different communities coming undone. This is the case in the region of Kaliningrad, called Königsberg in German, which was part of the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1992, and since then has belonged to the Russian Federation, with a natural border with the Baltic Sea, and land borders with Poland and Lithuania.

      <p sl="de">The expansion of the EU means that the Kaliningrad area in the Russian Federation has become an enclave within the EU. Around 1 million people live in three districts completely surrounded by EU territory. These people now encounter stringent transit and visa requirements when they wish to travel to Poland or to the main part of Russia. Council Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 sets down rules for local border traffic and external land borders of Member States (relating to a zone of 30 km) that are an exception to the provisions of the Schengen Agreement. In order to implement this regulation, the affected countries can conclude bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries in order to take the special conditions sufficiently into account. The EU has introduced initiatives in an effort to make it easier for those living in the area to commute between Kaliningrad and the Russian mainland. Thus far, however, these initiatives have proven inadequate. Poland and the Russian Federation have now petitioned for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006: as an exception, the border area is to be extended to 50 km so that the whole Kaliningrad area would be designated a border area. The Commission recommends that the regulation should be amended accordingly. I have also voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report we have voted on reveals an unequal treatment of partners. All residents of the Kaliningrad region have the opportunity of crossing the border; meanwhile, on the Polish side, only a 50 km wide section of the border area is covered by the visa-free travel programme. This harmful inequality must be resolved by extending the zone to cover the entire voivodship, and by discussing this issue at the next EU-Russia meeting.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the resolution also fails to mention the possibility of the movement of commercial and tourist vessels through the Pilawa Strait onto the Vistula Spit. Currently, the Russian side wants to limit the right of innocent passage with regard to the category of the straits. I think that we as the Union should seek to compensate for inequalities in the treatment of the inhabitants of the regions bordering the Kaliningrad region and provide the entire population of the voivodship, not just of selected districts, with the opportunity to enter the Kaliningrad region freely.</p>

There is no doubt that Croatia has made significant progress in recent years on reforming its legal system and public administration, fighting corruption and organised crime, and protecting the rights of minorities. However, I am sure that much remains to be done in remembrance of the huge ethnic cleansing of the Italian population carried out between 1945 and 1948 by the militia of the Croatian authorities of the former Yugoslavian communist regime. Above all, no commitment has been made to recognise the rights of exiles, starting with the property that was confiscated during those years.</p>

I also would like to stress the need for Croatia to keep up the reform momentum and to continue with the same vigour and hard work also after the conclusion of the negotiations and beyond accession. While acknowledging the good progress made, Croatia should continue to implement reform of the judiciary and facilitate the return of refugees and displaced persons, paying special attention to the situation of ethnic Serbian returnees. In addition to that, Croatian authorities should strengthen the administrative capacities of anti-corruption bodies and foster a culture of political, public sector and judicial accountability as a prerequisite for reinforcing the rule of law.</p>

Croatia’s accession helps the European Union prove that it remains receptive and capable of maintaining a genuine, constructive dialogue with its immediate neighbours. This is an extremely important consideration, especially during the current crisis the EU is going through, forcing it to become introverted. Dialogue and openness, both fundamental values of the EU, must remain benchmarks not only in its external relations and in issues such as immigration, but also with regard to internal European dynamics. This dialogue and openness should help kick-start the EU’s integration by rejecting nationalistic or xenophobic behaviour.</p>

Fortunately, Croatia has not deviated from this path, so that, in accordance with the criteria established by the EU, it is now ready to join this community of Member States and peoples.

      <p sl="pt">This proposal for a recommendation, drafted by Mr Swoboda, focuses on the Treaty concerning the Accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union, one of the three instruments that make up the process of accession of a country to the EU: treaty, protocol and final act. The accession of Croatia to the EU is a moment of great importance for Europe, and represents another step forward in the process of bringing stability to the Balkans. For Croatia, this phase does not represent the end of the process, but only the successful completion of one more stage. I would point out that this accession is an historic moment for Europe, as was evident in the enthusiasm with which Parliament applauded the adoption of the proposal for Croatia’s accession. As we are looking at a ‘happy marriage’ – the EU has an interest in its enlargement into the Balkans, and Croatia has much to gain from its accession to the single market – I welcome the accession of Croatia to the EU and hope that the Croatian Government will continue the process of democratisation and reform that is already under way, thus contributing to the principles which underlie the construction of the single market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The decision on Croatia’s accession, or that of any other country, to the European Union must come, first and foremost, from the free expression of the sovereign will of this country’s people. This is all the more important in the knowledge that this free expression – which, of course, involves a deep, participatory and informed discussion and decision – was not always ensured in other cases in the past.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We should neither ignore nor underestimate the meaning, nature and aims of this process of integration. The experience of other countries, including Portugal, shows us that the process of capitalist integration embodied by the EU involves the destruction of productive capacity and employment, the country’s increasing dependence, a disadvantageous, subordinated position which is peripheral to the process of the international division of labour, the loss of sovereignty over key elements which would have allowed our people to realise their wishes and aspirations, and which are absolutely essential to their free collective self-determination.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the internationalisation of the economy, the international division of labour, the growing cooperation between Member States and the processes of integration correspond to realities and trends of development which are not unique to capitalism. We are therefore fighting for this other Europe – a Europe that is not only possible, but also increasingly necessary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is up to the Croatian people, in the first place, to make the decision as to whether or not to join the EU. The Portuguese experience shows us that the EU’s process of capitalist integration has meant, and still means, first and foremost, the destruction of productive capacity and employment, the growing dependence of the country on the major powers of the EU, and a loss of sovereignty on key elements that would have allowed our people to realise their wishes and aspirations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the integration of economies is a dialectical necessity, its development within the framework of the capitalist system and the unequal development that this entails only favours the major powers and monopolies, particularly financial monopolies, impoverishing countries and peoples, sacrificing democracy and impeding the fight for economic and social systems that make work and human wellbeing their first and only priority.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Twenty years after declaring independence, and almost eight years after applying for membership of the EU, Croatia has reached an historic milestone, with the successful completion of the accession talks and the country now in the process of joining the EU, and these successes deserve unconditional acknowledgement. The accession process is making a substantial contribution to Croatia’s transformation into a solid and mature democratic country whose membership can strengthen the Union, enrich its European culture and heritage and make a major contribution to preserving the credibility of the expansion process. Despite considerable progress, however, I firmly believe that it is important to continue with the reforms initiated, that it is necessary to focus particularly on commitments undertaken in the area of the judiciary, internal affairs and basic rights – including the protection of media freedom, the impartial resolution of war crimes cases, the fight against corruption, protection of minorities, border controls, police cooperation, the fight against organised crime and judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters – as well as on commitments undertaken in the area of competition policy. Croatia’s determination to combat corruption, and also the progress achieved in the area of women’s rights and gender equality, for example, are pleasing. It is desirable for Croatia to continue consolidating good neighbourly relations, to continue as an important and active promoter of regional cooperation at all levels, and to back up its efforts towards membership with steps that will be economically, socially and generally beneficial to all citizens of this region.</p>

It is, in fact, developing into a centralised, supranational state, bypassing the peoples and the national parliaments, imposing its ultraliberal, globalist diktats, and conferring on itself the right to dictate the budgets of the Member States and, as a consequence, all of their actions, with its eyes firmly fixed on satisfying the markets rather than on people’s wellbeing. I understand the symbolic value, for the people of Croatia, of accession to the European Union. However, I also know that they will soon become disenchanted. The benefits that they will derive from membership will be far fewer than they had hoped, and the restrictions far more intolerable than they had expected.

A support mechanism will have to be maintained as part of a relationship of trust between the European Union and Croatia. This will ensure that the details of Croatia’s accession are favourable to each party.

It should also be emphasised that, unlike Turkey, Croatia has always pushed forward with the promised reforms.

      <p sl="fr">By consenting to Croatia’s accession to the European Union, the European Parliament has paved the way for the start of the country’s accession process and its ratification by the 27 Member States of the current European club. This agreement should be ratified at the European Council on 9 December with a view to Croatia’s official accession on 1 July 2013. Of course, now is not the time to hold celebrations such as those that marked the enlargement ceremonies held when 10 new countries joined the Union on 1 June 2004. However, it is important to welcome this jewel of the Mediterranean in a fitting manner; in other words, enthusiastically and firmly. A spontaneous accession, rather than accession by default, is needed, given the efforts made by Croatia’s people, and given, too, its standard of living and the economic situation in Croatia, both of which are much better than the indicators for other countries were when they joined. The crisis that has reigned in the Union since 2009 also implies the need for a firm stance towards new members, who have to become part of a virtuous circle: tight budgets and relentless efforts to combat corruption and to promote transparency. This, too, is a message that the Croatian authorities must hear.</p>

The EP has today also criticised the crackdown on the last Gay Pride Parade in Split, in spite of efforts by the EPP to muzzle this criticism. The EP must now continue to monitor the situation to ensure Croatia implements all reforms and that the EU Commission properly oversees this. To this end, the Greens believe the EP should be given the role of assessing the 6-monthly monitoring reports on Croatia’s progress.

      <p sl="fr">In the last few years, Croatia, which has been in accession negotiations with the European Union since 2005, has implemented radical structural reforms enabling it to meet EU membership requirements. Major reforms have been carried out with a view to promoting job creation, increasing competitiveness and strengthening fiscal policies. Many challenges remain, and the Croatian authorities must continue their reforms, particularly their judicial reforms, to combat corruption and organised crime. In order to heal the wounds of the past, Croatia needs to redouble its efforts to prosecute war criminals, follow the set of recommendations made by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and encourage the return of war refugees, especially the Serbs. Croatia’s forthcoming accession is a positive signal for the region as a whole; it is a sign that reforms pay, and that is why I voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">As we all remember, the EU accession of Croatia was a special priority of the Hungarian EU Presidency programme. Therefore, at this historic moment when we decided with an overwhelming majority in favour of Croatia becoming a full Member State of the EU, I consider it particularly important to highlight the immense efforts made by the Hungarian Presidency for the conclusion of the accession negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I am pleased to note that the Hungarians’ commitment has borne fruit. With the European Parliament approving Croatia’s accession today, we have opened a new chapter in the life of the EU. Enlargement is undeniable proof of the strength of European integration. At the same time, we must not forget that the ratification of the Accession Treaty by the Member States, and the Croatian referendum, still lie before us; however, if everything proceeds as planned, Croatia may join the European Union in July 2013.</p>

Furthermore, the Commission must inform Parliament on a regular basis about the extent to which the Croatian authorities are honouring their commitments, with a view to assuming fully the obligations arising from being a member when it joins, on 1 July 2013.

As a result of the debt crisis, the EU is currently undergoing its greatest test since its foundation. Consolidation must take precedence over expansion if we are to preserve the European project.

This event will enable Croatia and its citizens to take full advantage of the rights and guarantees provided for by the EU Treaties. Beyond these rights, the Croatian authorities must respect the commitments it has taken in the negotiations and encourage representatives of civil society to play a role in the entire accession process. Meanwhile, further support through the pre-accession instrument ought to facilitate adaptation to the reforms that are undertaken. However, my vote in favour of this report also serves to emphasise the need to proceed with the reforms geared towards ensuring that the magistracy is impartial and transparent on all forms of corruption and international organised crime.

      <p sl="sk">Twenty years after declaring independence, and almost eight years after applying for membership of the EU, Croatia has reached an historic milestone, with the successful completion of the accession talks and the country now in the process of joining the EU, and these successes deserve unconditional acknowledgement. The accession process is making a substantial contribution to Croatia’s transformation into a solid and mature democratic country whose membership can strengthen the Union, enrich its European culture and heritage and make a major contribution to preserving the credibility of the expansion process. Despite considerable progress, however, I firmly believe that it is important to continue with the reforms initiated, that it is necessary to focus particularly on commitments undertaken in the area of the judiciary, internal affairs and basic rights – including the protection of media freedom, the impartial resolution of war crimes cases, the fight against corruption, protection of minorities, border controls, police cooperation, the fight against organised crime and judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters – as well as on commitments undertaken in the area of competition policy. Croatia’s determination to combat corruption, and also the progress achieved in the area of women’s rights and gender equality, for example, are pleasing. It is desirable for Croatia to continue consolidating good neighbourly relations, to continue as an important and active promoter of regional cooperation at all levels, and to back up its efforts towards membership with steps that will be economically, socially and generally beneficial to all citizens of this region.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document because accession negotiations with Croatia have now been concluded, bringing to an end almost six years of negotiation and several years of preparation that have significantly altered the country’s socio-political, economic and cultural landscape. Reforms must continue, however, and I believe that this process is not complete but should continue with the same vigour and hard work after the conclusion of the negotiations and beyond accession. The positive results of this process will strengthen support for EU membership among Croatia’s citizens, as well as their trust in it, and will encourage people to participate in the EU referendum and support the signing of the Accession Treaty. I welcome the signing of the Accession Treaty, and all EU Member States should now complete its ratification in a timely manner.</p>

The enlargement of the EU to include Croatia represents an opportunity for growth and development for both parties to the agreement. This is an important moment and one that concludes years of negotiations that have seen Croatia striving to build social and economic standards in line with the EU’s expectations and principles. It must not be forgotten that the political history of Croatia, as well as many other countries in the Balkans, reflects a difficult and complex path of building democracy. I am sure that today, a new journey has begun which will see, on the one hand, Croatia committed to improving its social sectors and, on the other, the European Union strengthened by enlargement incorporating a new Member State, according to the principles set out by our founding fathers in the awareness of the importance of being united in diversity.</p>

The European integration of the Western Balkans is a key strategy for achieving the European objectives of stability and prosperity. Croatia has made progress in every area involved in the accession process during the last 12 months and is a state offering great potential for the EU. The accession process has made a considerable contribution to turning Croatia into a democracy based on European values and has given impetus to the political and economic reforms.

Throughout the accession process, the EU’s main objective has been to foster a competitive neoliberal economy in Croatia and bring about privatisation in certain key sectors. The focus was on improving conditions to make Croatia more attractive to foreign investors. Thus, the reforms being encouraged by the EU are basically aimed at overhauling the socio-economic system, which will lead to increased social and economic differences in the country.

EU enlargement requires much effort and commitment but is a mutually beneficial instrument which ensures peace, stability, reconciliation and development, and this effect is not confined to one country but also has a regional impact. I hope that Croatia’s success will encourage the other states in the region to go energetically down this path. Even after the Treaty concerning the Accession of the Republic of Croatia has been signed at the European Council on 8-9 December, it will not be a time for relaxation but rather for continuing political and economic reforms, in particular, in the areas of consolidating the rule of law, combating corruption and organised crime, safeguarding human rights, improving the business environment and creating friendly and stable relations with neighbours. The EU must also prepare properly for Croatia’s accession, take account of it in the 2013 multiannual financial framework, and include Croatia in negotiations for the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework. I hope that the ratification process in EU countries will run smoothly and that Croatia will be ready to become the 28th Member State as scheduled from 1 July 2013, during the Lithuanian Council Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="en">The green light by the European Parliament to the application of Croatia to accede to the EU comes at a very right time. When some external actors may wish to see the EU disintegrating, the accession of a new member sends out a reassuring signal: ‘The reports of its death are greatly exaggerated’. The accession of Croatia does not, however, mark the end of the country’s European integration. The experience of Estonia, as well as of the other Member States that have joined recently, has taught that even more difficult challenges lay ahead. It is far more demanding to establish a relatively small country as a full-fledged active Member State on a routine basis than to meet the fixed criteria and conclude the negotiations. Membership calls for a long-term perspective, patience and willingness to compromise for the common good in order to secure the viability of European Union as an influential global actor. I look forward to working with my future colleagues from Croatia to reach those goals and hope that soon enough, we may greet all the Western Balkans to the European Union.</p>

In this sense, an incentive for the consolidation of democracies of the different states of the Balkan Peninsula opens up here, with a view to possible accession to the common area. In view of these facts, it is necessary to begin the process of effective entry into the EU.

      <p sl="it">The report sets out a series of laudable amendments to the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament. The importance of our roles here means that we are duty-bound, both politically and in terms of ethics and transparency, to make the rules governing the relationship between our positions and our outside interests as stringent and rigorous as possible. I support the insertion of these amendments as per the report by Mr Casini, especially the introduction of greater clarity on conflicts of interest and the funding and support received for carrying out our political activities. The new provisions on penalties for breaching the code and the creation of an Advisory Committee on the behaviour of MEPs are also to be welcomed. My vote on the report by Mr Casini is therefore in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report in question, drafted by Mr Casini, deals with the amendments to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure relating to the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament with respect to financial interests and conflicts of interest. The current economic crisis, which many citizens attribute to politicians’ wrong decisions, has led to this group of professionals being put under very tight public surveillance involving new information technology, as in the case of Wikileaks , with the disclosure of confidential information. Today, more than ever before, it is crucial that rules for transparency are established with respect to the financial interests of public officials. In the case of Members of the European Parliament, under the terms of Article 232 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it is up to Parliament to establish rules on the interests of its Members. As I am aware that appearances are extremely important, I am voting for the proposed amendments to the existing regulation.</p>

The Members of the EP will have to submit a declaration of financial interests containing a range of information including, inter alia , their employment history for the three-year period before taking office with the EP.

      <p sl="pl">I would like to express my full support for the contents of the new Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament with respect to financial interests and conflicts of interest. I am glad that we managed to reach a compromise during work in the relevant committee, as reflected by the large number of votes cast by my fellow Members in favour of amending the Rules of Procedure. New changes to the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament represent yet another important step towards introducing clearer rules and, at the same time, clear sanctions for a failure to comply with these rules, and they aim to increase confidence in Parliament as well as making the work of the European institutions more transparent overall.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The new rules focus on introducing rigorous provisions in relation to the problem of conflicts of interest, the preparation of financial statements published on Parliament’s website and the acceptance of special gifts. Moreover, the new provisions also cover rapporteurs, who may lose their mandate if they violate the abovementioned rules contained in the Code of Conduct. I think that the creation of an Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members is also a good initiative, which will assist Members in the practical interpretation and implementation of the rules of the code. I would once again like to thank the rapporteur from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the huge amount of work he has put into preparing the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of establishing this new Code of Conduct for MEPs. The code forbids Members from undertaking lobbying activities alongside their parliamentary duties, prohibits us from receiving gifts worth more than EUR 150, requires us to notify all the activities that we carry out and remuneration that we receive whilst we are MEPs and before we take office, and requires us to declare any membership of an association, any type of interest in a company or organisation of so-called ‘influence’ and any other type of financial interest. In particular, I voted in favour of Amendment 10, which proposed abolishing the EUR 5 000 threshold above which MEPs must declare all outside activities for which they receive payment. By establishing these strict rules, our Parliament intends to make its daily activities clearer and more transparent. Equally, this is about restoring, to some extent, the external image of MEPs and about combating the prevailing anti-parliamentarism. This code is also intended to re-establish everyone’s accountability. I regret, however, that such measures are only adopted in response to scandals (one recalls here the scandal of the three MEPs caught acting in a blatantly corrupt manner by lobbyists in March 2011).</p>

Further, in order to rule out any possible abuse, provision must be made for penalties, which are proposed in this Code of Conduct. Finally, I rejected the initiatives aimed at weakening this set of measures – which some felt were ‘too transparent’ – as they would have prevented us from achieving an objective: that of restoring citizens’ faith in their elected officials.</p>

It is important that we carry out work in the most transparent way and, indeed, in an accountable fashion. However, I supported the amendment which proposed that we declare any remunerated income, not only that above EUR 5 000. I know there are administrative issues but this figure is far too high. For some people in some Member States, EUR 5 000 represents a year’s income and regardless of where you live, it is a very significant sum of money. I am concerned that we are giving out the wrong message here, and much of the good work we do will have been cancelled out by leaving this EUR 5 000 figure as part of the Code of Conduct – it is just too high.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Although the European Parliament has become a fully-fledged legislative institution under the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, as regards establishing the EU budget, the media and voters probably talk more about our salaries, benefits and related scandals than about the work we do. It is also a fact that Members of the European Parliament are able to obtain any amount of remuneration or other income from other sources without having to declare or report it to anybody. MEPs’ salaries are several or even many times greater than those of many of their constituents, so that when we talk about reducing poverty in Europe one day and then oppose a requirement to declare additional income the next, we look hypocritical. I welcome the amendments to the Rules of Procedure introducing a requirement to declare any other paid activity and income. It is nevertheless important that these provisions are actually implemented and do not remain merely aspirational. On the other hand, I believe that we could go even further by prohibiting MEPs from receiving any additional remuneration, as is done in some Member States’ national parliaments. Surely we will not become impoverished by living solely from our salary?</p>

      <p sl="de">The present crisis of confidence underlines the need for a clear code of conduct for Members of the European Parliament in relation to financial interests and possible conflicts of interest. Every MEP should perform his or her duties in accordance with the fundamental principles of impartiality, integrity, openness, due diligence, honesty, responsibility and maintaining Parliament’s good name. When a conflict of interest arises, the provisions of this code of conduct should provide some guidance. If the MEP is unable to resolve the conflict of interest, he is obliged to inform the President in writing. In cases of doubt, confidential advice can be sought from the Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members. In addition, before speaking or voting in plenary or at any of Parliament’s institutions, or when proposed as rapporteur, every Member should disclose any existing or potential conflict of interest in relation to the matter under consideration. Such a disclosure can be made orally or in writing to the President during the relevant parliamentary debates. I believe that these measures make sense and will promote confidence.

      <p sl="et">I consider it important to change the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, which would, among other things, create a better overview of Members’ paid extra-parliamentary activities and the income connected therewith. Although I support Mr Casini’s report, I do not support sub-clause ‘e’ of the motion to amend clause 2 number 10, which would require Members of Parliament to declare in their declarations of economic interests only those extra-parliamentary expenses above EUR 5 000 per calendar year. I find that the establishment of such a limit is not justified because it would encourage the non-declaration of income that falls just short of the EUR 5 000 limit. In addition, it is unclear why EUR 5 000 should be chosen as the limit; why not EUR 2 000 or 200, for instance? EUR 5 000 is a large amount of money – in many Member States, it represents the annual pay of a worker who earns average wages. I believe that in the interests of greater transparency, Members of the European Parliament should declare all income received from extra-parliamentary activities, and if we are to set a limit, it could be 10 times lower, for instance, EUR 500.</p>

The new rules include greater transparency and control over Members’ declarations of financial interests, a clear definition of the meaning of conflict of interest, the obligation to refuse any gift worth more than EUR 150 and the establishment of a committee in which Members are monitored by their peers. Be that as it may, and to quote a colleague who has a way with words: ‘Catching someone with their hand in the cookie jar is no reason to ban cookies …’ Even with the strictest possible rules and penalties, you will not prevent abuse.

To those people, who include certain members of the far right, we say: ‘There should be nothing to hide!’ Incidentally, I regret that the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left were the only ones who all voted against an amendment proposing to limit the declaration of supplementary income to income in excess of EUR 5 000. Unfortunately, this amendment was still adopted. Let us hope that this text will help put an end to numerous fantasies that discredit political action as a whole and that are constantly fed by the practices, inherent in human nature, of a few. Following this further step in the direction of greater transparency, political debate should refocus on far more important issues.</p>

Mr Uspaskich was unhappy with this decision and submitted two appeals. The first was submitted on 5 April 2011 and was announced in Parliament in the plenary session of 9 May 2011. The second was submitted on 11 April 2011 and was announced in Parliament in the plenary session of 4 July 2011.

      <p sl="sk">It is appropriate to deal with the requests made by Viktor Uspaskich on 5 and 11 April 2011 together since they relate to the same legal proceedings. Criminal proceedings have been brought against the Member of the European Parliament (MEP), who is charged essentially with offences of false accounting in relation to the financing of a political party during a period prior to his election to the European Parliament. On 7 September 2010, Parliament waived Viktor Uspaskich’s immunity, considering that no cogent evidence had been furnished as to the existence of any fumus persecutionis and that the offences with which the MEP is charged had nothing to do with his activities as a Member of the European Parliament. Subsequently, on 28 October 2010, Viktor Uspaskich brought an action for the annulment of Parliament’s decision of 7 September 2010 before the General Court, only to withdraw it in July 2011. In a letter of 5 April 2011 requesting the defence of his immunity, he claims that the criminal proceedings initiated by the Lithuanian authorities prevent him from performing, or make it difficult for him to perform, his parliamentary duties by restraining his freedom of movement contrary to Article 7 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union. After thoroughly examining all of the available facts, however, Parliament has concluded not to defend the immunity and privileges of Viktor Uspaskich and will forward this decision and the report of its competent committee to the appropriate authority in the Republic of Lithuania.</p>

      <p sl="et">Unlike the other members of my group, I did not vote in favour of this report, which did not support the request by the Member of the European Parliament, Mr Viktor Uspaskich, who was elected from Lithuania, for a review of the European Parliament decision of 7 September 2010 regarding him. Through WikiLeaks, my earlier suspicion that the accusations made against Mr Uspaskich were politically motivated, and that procedure was violated in his case, were once again confirmed. Many Lithuanian politicians, including members of the governing party, have admitted that several procedural rules were violated, and that the accusations do not necessarily have any legal basis, but the withdrawal of the accusations made against Mr Uspaskich would tarnish the reputation of Lithuania’s governmental institutions and legal system. All of this reminds me of a series of earlier cases connected with members of my home party, the Estonian Centre Party, where it became clear after the elections that the accusations had been politically motivated and unfounded. In this case, protecting the reputation of the Lithuanian government agencies and legal system is not my concern, but the defence of justice and human rights is. These are among the axioms of the European Union considered to be of the utmost importance.</p>

      <p sl="it">We find ourselves in a specific moment of crisis in which the coordination of Member States’ economic policies has a crucial role. The experience of the preceding European Semester has shown that national reform programmes still lack transparency and viability. National economic and budgetary policies must be used to reach the objectives set out in the Stability Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy. That is why we need to assess the situation at a European level, so that the Union can take a coordinated approach in order to tackle European and national economic difficulties. I hope that in January, starting with the presentation of the Annual Growth Survey by the Commission, a clearer framework of all the future coordination actions in the economic sphere is mapped out for us, so that the challenges ahead can be faced with greater determination and fortitude.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament demonstrated resolve and ambition in dealing with the economic and financial crisis when, last September, it adopted the ‘economic governance package’, which contains six legislative proposals all designed to strengthen economic governance in the European Union. One of these proposals includes the establishment of a European Semester, a forum for debate in which to assess and coordinate the economic and budgetary policies of Member States before they go ahead and adopt them. Although I am convinced that this coordination is essential in order to pull Europe out of the crisis, I note that the Berès report does not really heed the lessons of the first European Semester, trialled last July.</p>

The members of the Danish Socialist People’s Party in the European Parliament therefore have reservations about this passage, but have voted in favour of the report in general, as it contains many good elements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Berès report is commendable in that it rebalances the Commission’s proposal on the European Semester, which simply had to be done. By focusing on the priority of employment and on the idea that the budgetary, economic and social strategies introduced must have a redistributive and developmental role, the report gives new meaning to the prospects of overcoming the crisis, as we hope to do. Unfortunately, the European Parliament is still not involved enough in the European Semester process, just as, in fact, it is often excluded from the current crisis management efforts, which is a key problem for EU democracy and legitimacy. Therefore, I can only share the view that an interparliamentary conference involving both the EP and the national parliaments should be organised next year, so that, finally, we can open a broader debate on the measures we want to take and the project we want to support.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I support this resolution because I think that coordination of economic policies is particularly important to the euro area’s operation, and this resolution contains a number of very useful recommendations for improving the European Semester. I think that the coordination process needs to have broader democratic legitimacy. For this to happen, the European Parliament and national parliaments need to be more actively involved. I am pleased that the rapporteur abandoned the notion of setting up a special parliamentary committee made up only of MEPs from the countries in the euro area, as such an initiative would have led to a split in Parliament, exerting an adverse impact on its operation. Such a measure is especially difficult to understand as most Member States which are not part of the euro area at the moment, including Romania, would like to adopt the single currency in the future. This means that all the Members of this Parliament have an interest in making the euro area operate efficiently. Last but not least, as is also recommended in this report, I feel it is absolutely essential that Member States’ economic policies attach major importance to economic growth as, in the current climate of austerity, we greatly need policies which will bring us back to the path of economic growth and put an end to austerity.</p>

      <p sl="el">The European Semester and closer coordination of fiscal policies between the Member States, based on the prevailing neoliberal approach, is fully in keeping with plans by the Merkel/Sarkozy alliance. On the pretext of ‘regaining’ the trust of the markets, citizens’ rights are being sacrificed and social acquis is being trampled underfoot. Continuous austerity and continuous recession, unemployment and poverty are essentially becoming systemic. The European Semester has been overtaken by events. It no longer suffices to safeguard the interests of Ms Merkel and her allies. However, it is the ‘basic idea’ for creating a stricter stability pact and a ‘fiscal union of the willing’ which will put a stranglehold on the Member States and the European people. The budgets of the Member States will be planned and approved by Berlin, while the creation of a multi-track Europe of the ‘strong’ and the ‘weak’ will leave the weaker Member States prey to the whims of speculators. The report on the European Semester is fully in line with the failed neoliberal policies of the EU and deprives the Member States of the facility to exercise an alternative, anti-cyclical policy designed to redistribute wealth and sustainable growth.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report since I believe that coordinating economic policies has an extremely important role to play in this period of major crisis for the European Union. Now more than ever, Europe must take a symmetrical approach, founded on a shared response from the Member States, to the problems deriving from the economic crisis, the resulting increase in inequality and macro-financial imbalances. In my opinion, the various countries’ policies ought to be highly interconnected so as to guarantee sustainable growth and increased employment, as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Union must address European citizens’ lack of faith in European integration. I therefore consider it essential that this coordination is geared towards ensuring greater legitimacy, accountability and transparency in decision-making processes. Furthermore, since the goal of the European Semester is to check that the budget discipline is being applied and to supervise the realisation of the EU 2020 strategy, the requirement for transparency is essential. I am hoping for greater effort from the Member States to ensure that economic, financial and social policies are more effective.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Today, the European Semester is fully accepted as a cornerstone of the new economic governance framework. The main purpose of this process, which was set out for the first time in the first economic governance package, is to increase economic and fiscal coordination and to ensure the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy in all Member States. As such, it aims to attribute a greater level of democratic responsibility to national parliaments, in both the preparation and the subsequent implementation of their national budgets, and, at the same time, to offer a platform for the exchange of information and for sharing best budgetary implementation practices. It is undeniable that reinforcing economic coordination policies is one way for Europe to achieve the necessary fiscal consolidation it requires. The economic situation we are currently experiencing has further emphasised this need, and a lot certainly remains to be done in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Ms Honeyball, addresses the problem of early school leaving and the measures and instruments adopted by the EU aimed at assisting the Member States in setting out more efficient and effective national policies to resolve this problem. In the Europe 2020 strategy, the six headline targets include the reduction of the proportion of early school leavers to 10%. It should be noted that in 2009, the early school leaving rate for all 18 to 24-year-olds stood at 14.4%. This is a matter of extreme importance, as by tackling this problem, we will not only boost the self-esteem of citizens, but also improve their quality of life, thus helping to reduce poverty and the number of those who are socially excluded. Firstly, it is necessary to identify groups that are at risk, such as ethnic minorities, parents who have a low level of education, children from rural areas, as well as the causes of dropping out of school, such as academic failure and the factors that exacerbate it, including poverty, abuse and an unstable family background.

      <p sl="pt">This is yet another crucial report because of the importance of the issues at stake and its profoundly negative implications. Like the other fundamental steps being taken in this process of European integration – which is clearly culminating in the serious economic and social crisis we are facing – this is yet another report that has the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.

For example, some of the amendments we tabled criticise the veritably aggressive programmes of the troika of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank; defend a policy of effective budgetary stabilisation that takes account of growth and is aimed at wealth redistribution, sustainable development, job creation and social progress; and stress the need to reverse neoliberal economic policies in order to overcome the crisis.

      <p sl="pt">We therefore tabled amendments to this report, which have not been adopted. For example, some of the amendments we tabled call on the Member States, the Council and the Commission to take account of the strong and ever-increasing resistance of European citizens to the harsh measures of the troika’s ‘bailout packages’ and the austerity policies followed; consider fiscal policy an important instrument in the management of economic and development policy, but the introduction of the European Semester and the stifling effects arising from the anticipation of fiscal policy coordination will prevent the Member States from having the ability and the flexibility required to pursue an effective stabilisation policy aimed at redistribution of wealth, at sustainable development and at job creation, so providing people with an adequate range of public services and infrastructure; and stress that trying to overcome the crisis by implementing stricter budgetary discipline and deregulation measures will not eliminate the root causes of the crisis but will instead aggravate the situation and reinforce neoliberal economic policies.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The deepening crisis, inequalities and macro-financial imbalances and disparities in competitiveness have highlighted the need for the Union to tackle macro-economic imbalances more appropriately, coordinate economic and fiscal policies more closely, and improve budgetary surveillance. Several interlinked policies for sustainable growth and jobs should form the basis for an improved economic governance framework. Excessive debt and deficits in some Member States can have profound negative spill over effects on other Member States and on the euro area as a whole. I consider it necessary and important to ensure greater interaction between employment, social and economic policies in the context of the European Semester. These steps should be taken for the benefit of all generations and in a manner fostering democratic accountability, ownership and legitimacy of all actors involved. An essential part of this is the support and full involvement of the European Parliament. The European Semester is an institutional process, under the leadership of the European Union (EU) institutions, of increased coordination across Member States for the implementation of the EU strategy, notably in its macro-economic dimension.</p>

In order to deal with the major changes that will have to take place if it is to emerge from the crisis, the EU must ensure the strong democratic legitimacy of its decisions. This legitimacy can only be guaranteed with the European Parliament’s support and involvement in the annual drafting of the EU’s main economic policy guidelines. In particular, it is essential for Parliament to participate in the European Semester procedure, during which each of the 27 draft national budgets is assessed by the European Commission. Following this procedure, Parliament should have the chance to amend the macro-economic policy guidelines proposed to Member States. This democratic development also requires enhanced dialogue with the national parliaments and the social partners in order to support European economic policy coherence and guarantee that the EU 2020 objectives are taken into account. Finally, it is vital that the Treaties be revised only with the agreement and, where necessary, the involvement, of Parliament.</p>

Indeed, a purely intergovernmental system of coordination is an inadequate response to the requirement for economic policies to be regarded as a matter of common concern.

With the introduction of the European Semester, we are one step closer to European integration. However, we should remember that parliamentary debate on the main economic policy guidelines is the cornerstone of every democratic system. Democratic debate must not be overlooked.

What is even worse is the fact that the European leadership continues to close its eyes to any sensible alternative for resolving the problem. Instead, they continue along the wrong path first chosen at the end of the 1990s, when the euro was launched. In their desperation, the Eurocrats can think of no better remedy than to call for even greater centralisation in Brussels. However, instead of shifting more powers to Brussels with the European Semester, what we should be doing is preventing the indebtedness in the first place. In view of the morass that is the debt crisis, the priority should be at all costs to prevent the economically sound members of the euro area from being dragged into the abyss too.

However, it is not the first time that these much heralded strategies have turned out to be overwhelming failures, and the crisis cannot be used as an excuse for the expected failure of the Europe 2020 strategy as well. Focusing many of the objectives of economic policy coordination on this strategy looks to me like a move that is risky at best. I must also add that, in various points, it seems to be a case of coordinating the social policies of Member States, rather than their economies. The semester of coordination has only been in place for a few months, but I think that its value and meaning ought to be different from the content of this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Instead of finally giving a chance to weaker national economies outside the euro area, Brussels is now placing its hopes in a planned economy. Economic and social policy, in other words, the key competences of a sovereign state, are now subject to the centralist monitoring of the Commission and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin). National reform programmes have to be presented in Brussels so that ‘anomalies can be identified at an early stage’. The recommendations of the Council and the Commission are then to be implemented in the second semester. This system will never work. This is not just my opinion – a study by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance comes to the same conclusion: it estimates the efficiency of the recommendations in the last semester as non-existent. Why is that? Growth cannot be forced through a centralised planned economy. We need to remedy the mistakes made when the euro area was established and form a hard currency zone. This must be made up of sovereign states with sovereign economic policies. For this reason, I have voted against this report.</p>

When assessing the experience of the first wave of the crisis, EU institutions and Member States should not just look differently at the future but also examine the current situation differently, but this is often not the case. However, the world has changed significantly in recent years. The directives being adopted are not effective enough to overcome the new challenges arising every day and ever growing old challenges in the economic, financial and social fields. Today, the main issue on the EU agenda is that of the scale of unemployment in Member States. We must implement urgent measures and programmes to ensure that unemployment is reduced by at least a third as quickly as possible.

Otherwise, in overall terms, Europe or many Member States risk falling into recession. Amidst all this, we cannot forget the relationship with our citizens and that is why, in the report by Ms Berès on the European Semester, we are asking for greater involvement from the national parliaments and from this House.

      <p sl="pt">The aim of the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination was to introduce a way of synchronising European and national economic and financial policies. Today, any effort to conceptualise the political world that attempts to explain the current reality will tend to point to a ‘web-like political reality’ or, rather, ‘polyarchical’ power and webs of ‘interconstitutionality’. The purpose of this is to explain how the decisions made by one political player have an impact on all the others.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The real issue is therefore to determine to what extent democratic legitimacy can be brought to bear at a time when traditional decision-making procedures no longer appear to be offering a suitable response. Therefore, while it is no longer possible to preserve the traditional concept of sovereignty, which, in practice, would be profoundly unrealistic, it is still possible to secure the concurrence of powers and to involve the national parliaments and the European Parliament, which are directly legitimised institutions, as fellow players.

More than 350 amendments were tabled in ECON. In order to avoid the ‘left-right’ clash of the economic governance package, Ms Berès opted for a smart and inclusive process of negotiation which led to a good outcome. Most key Green amendments (47) survived through the negotiation process, including the following very good elements: - The EP commits to organise a public hearing to hold a dialogue based on the ‘comply or explain’ principle with the Commission and the Council at which the recommendations from the Commission, and the changes introduced by the Council, would be discussed. - The report emphasises that the guidelines for the employment policies of Member States and the broad economic guidelines both form integral parts of the European Semester and are equally important for the achievement of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

In particular, it is about ensuring that national budgets are fully compatible, firstly, with the stability or convergence programmes presented a few months earlier and, secondly, with the economic guidelines laid down at European level. During those six months (January to July), the budgetary and structural policies of Member States will be reviewed, on the basis of the information they provide, in order to identify any possible inconsistencies or signs of imbalance.

At the moment, in the first year of the European Semester, it is difficult to predict whether this instrument will perform its function. Although more and more Member States are implementing the Commission’s recommendations, such as raising the pension age, facilitating access to capital and using public procurement to stimulate the economy, we still lack determination and coordination at European level.

      <p sl="hu">The most important task ahead of us now is to create an instrument for the prevention of future public debt crises which is effective at Community level.

      <p sl="hu">Increased coordination of Member State economic policies is a necessary but insufficient condition of recovery from the crisis.

I regard it as important that both the Commission and the Council ensure that sustainable, inclusive growth is at the heart of all the policy proposals made as part of the European Semester, along with employment and job creation. The measures adopted as part of the national reform plans, aimed at implementing economic governance and the European Semester, must not exacerbate the social crisis. I advocate that the recommendations from the Commission and Council must be mainly focused on a social policy conducive to education and vocational training, access to employment, the reintegration of the unemployed into the labour market and better coordination of Member States’ social welfare systems. Furthermore, the EU must consolidate the internal market and remove the barriers preventing workers’ mobility within the EU. I call for the Commission’s recommendations, specific to each country, to be accompanied by assessments of the social impact, taking into account the promotion of employment and the guarantee of access to education and ongoing training programmes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted against the report on the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination because, although it adopts a relatively critical tone, it is still in keeping with the Europe 2020 strategy, with the efforts to strengthen the single market and the ‘six-pack’, and, in particular, with the Wortmann-Kool report. This just goes to show that some MEPs are talking out of both sides of their mouths. There is no point in saying here that parliamentary approval of public budgets is one of the foundations of democracy when the legislative texts say otherwise. Yet again, economic policies are being prioritised over social issues. This report will have no effect on current European policies. I therefore have no reason to change my vote against the ‘six-pack’.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The proper and smooth functioning of the single market is an essential condition for the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the EU and for ensuring its economic development. We will mark an important event in 2012 – the twentieth anniversary of the creation of the single market, and it is therefore important to know and understand how the single market will develop in the future and what the concerns and expectations of participants in the single market are. In October this year, the Single Market Forum, organised at the initiative of the Commission and the Polish Presidency, showed that there are still many legal and administrative obstacles to the smooth functioning of the single market. I believe that implementation of the Single Market Act should be monitored at the highest political level, and that the Commission should regularly review its implementation and the transposition of the relevant legislation into Member States’ national law and issue reports. I welcome the fact that the resolution calls for the completion of the digital single market and for remaining technical barriers to cross-border trade and service provision to be overcome, in particular, by improving the mutual recognition of electronic IDs, electronic signatures and electronic documents. I wish to stress the importance of establishing common principles of public procurement at EU level since this would enable a number of remaining administrative and bureaucratic obstacles to be eliminated and would provide more opportunities, in particular for SMEs, to develop cross-border activities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The single market has brought about enormous benefits for the 500 million European citizens and has given European businesses new opportunities to expand. This resolution suggests that the points of single contact be developed into fully-fledged e-Government centres allowing entrepreneurs to submit and manage administrative formalities online.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Digital Single Market will only be complete once technical setbacks to cross-border trade and to the provision of cross-border services have been overcome. The public procurement sector needs to be professionalised, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need to step up their involvement in the award of public contracts. This resolution also suggests the use of an effective, accessible and straightforward alternative dispute-resolution system. It is clear that the Digital Single Market promotes innovation, which, with the support of the Commission’s coordinated initiatives and the commitment of the Member States, will create new opportunities for businesses, particularly SMEs. This will encourage job creation and social cohesion and will lead to sustainable economic growth; it will also meet the social needs of European consumers and citizens.

The economic crisis cannot make us oblivious to the human aspects of the reforms, such as the wellbeing of citizens, consumers, workers and savers. The purpose of this forum, which involved more than 1 300 participants (businesses, social partners, NGOs, European institutions, public authorities, etc.), was to discuss strategies for improving the functioning of the single market, such as promoting freedom of movement among European citizens through the automatic recognition of professional qualifications, speeding up the online Alternative Dispute Resolution system, transforming Points of Single Contact, protecting the interests of online purchasers, creating the European patent, etc. I am voting in favour of this resolution and welcome the attention it gives to small and medium-sized enterprises, the real engines of the European economy, which have the power to bring about recovery from the current economic and financial crisis by means of sustainable economic growth, thus making the single market economy increasingly dynamic and competitive.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We have here an initiative and a resolution that are highly significant for the majority in this Parliament. The first recital in the resolution is, in fact, very revealing when it declares that ‘the European Single Market has brought tremendous benefits to 500 million Europeans, whilst opening up new opportunities for expansion for more than 21 million European businesses, and has become the real engine for growth within the European economy’. This ignores a basic fact: in the actual conditions under which this process of integration is taking place, the opportunities referred to really have arisen for some people, while, for others, they have remained mere promises, endlessly postponed, and have turned into nightmares.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Some have experienced real expansion, others only a long-drawn-out death and disappearance. Free-market competition has made life easy for the sections of society that wield economic and financial power, but has aggravated unemployment, increased the rate of bankruptcy among countless small and medium-sized enterprises, and done nothing to improve the day-to-day lives of the general population, as the present crisis is making plain. It is for these reasons that, on being presented with such a picture as this resolution puts before us, our only response can be to protest against the pressure being exerted here to entrench the single market yet further, which the rhetoric of ‘consultation’ and ‘participation’ essentially does nothing to change.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We have voted against this resolution, which declares as its very first point: ‘whereas the European Single Market has brought tremendous benefits to 500 million Europeans, whilst opening up new opportunities for expansion for more than 21 million European businesses, and has become the real engine for growth within the European economy’. Really, such a declaration cannot be allowed to pass when we bear in mind that free-market competition has made life easy for the sections of society that wield economic and financial power, but has aggravated unemployment, increased the rate of bankruptcy among micro-enterprises and SMEs and done nothing to improve the day-to-day lives of the general population, as the present crisis is making plain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thus, even though the Single Market Forum may be converted into a regular event to enable businesses and citizens, as well as local and regional authorities, to participate directly in and influence the further development of the single market, the truth remains that the current state of affairs is quite different from that proclaimed in this report. Similarly, we disagree with the pressure being exerted here to further entrench the single market.</p>

In a large number of areas, there is still a gap between what people expect from the single market and what they experience in practice. The first Single Market Forum brought together European businesses, social partners, non-governmental organisations, think-tanks, journalists, national Parliaments, European institutions, public authorities at various levels of government and European citizens. It is important that this forum becomes a regular event, to enable businesses and citizens as well as local and regional authorities to directly participate in, and thereby collectively influence, the further development of the single market. I believe that it would be appropriate to create a Single Market Forum on-line, as a platform open to the general public, enabling them to keep abreast of single market developments and share experiences and current single market concerns. It is necessary for governments, regional and local entities, businesses, trade unions and non-governmental organisations to cooperate to ensure that single market rules work effectively on the ground for citizens and businesses.</p>

The priority measures that the Commission will come up with in the coming months in the Single Market Act should focus on the need to drive sustainable and innovative economic growth, hand in hand with initiatives taken by Member States and the business community to boost growth in the EU at a time of economic recession. 2 - The single market must, as a matter of priority, generate new opportunities for businesses in Europe, starting with innovative SMEs. The Small Business Act principle must underpin all initiatives taken in the framework of the single market, to create a small business-friendly environment for our enterprises to thrive on the markets, accompanied by sound and fair regulation which does not create additional unnecessary burdens on SMEs which are the core of our potential for growth in Europe.</p>

However, many citizens, consumers and SMEs still do not have enough information and knowledge concerning their rights and opportunities in the single market. Consequently, I believe that the Commission must draw up and adopt a charter of citizens’ rights setting out citizens’ rights and obligations in the single market. This charter would be addressed to all citizens moving, working, buying and selling at cross-border level.

In 2012, we are even going to organise a ‘Single Market Week’ across all countries in the Union. In these times of economic crisis and uncertainty, it is more necessary than ever to give fresh impetus to the single market. To achieve this, the gap between what Europeans expect of the single market and what they actually get out of it will need to be bridged (let us remember, in this context, citizens’, consumers’ and SMEs’ lack of knowledge regarding their rights, obligations and opportunities in the single market).

      <p sl="fr">It was the Single Market Act, adopted in early 2011, that led to the decision to set up this forum, the first of which was held last October. It was attended by over 1 000 participants from different sectors of society (businesses, social partners, NGOs, think-tanks, members of the national parliaments, members of the European institutions and representatives of national public authorities) and laid the groundwork for a number of actions to be undertaken ahead of the 20th anniversary of the single market, in 2012. In my opinion, one of these actions is of the utmost importance: modernising the rules on public procurement. We need to rethink our tender rules quickly in order to cope with competition from third countries and to ensure that European companies are on a level playing field where procurement outside the European Union is concerned. The European Commission promised us a specific instrument by the end of 2011, yet it has already been severely delayed, putting our companies into difficulty. Our companies are competitive, but they are being held back by outdated legislation. This situation cannot continue.</p>

It is a good thing that the Commission and the Council are acting swiftly to apply the communication entitled ‘Combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries 2009-2013’.

I therefore agree there is an urgent need for more equitable access to HIV prevention in the EU, as well as to the relevant testing and treatment, while, at the same time, the necessary resources must be guaranteed. I believe the text of the resolution is well balanced overall and correctly brings across the principle that ‘the enemy is HIV, rather than HIV carriers’. Unfortunately, partisan pressure from some Members has led to the inclusion of a reference to abortion, which is unrelated.

      <p sl="sk">According to the 2010 Report on HIV Surveillance by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC), 25 917 newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection were reported in 2009 by the countries of the European Union and European Economic Area and the number of HIV infections is rising at an alarming rate, particularly in Eastern Europe. A large proportion of HIV infections remain undiagnosed; many people do not know their serostatus and there is a relatively high likelihood that they will discover it only once they are affected by HIV/AIDS-related illnesses. Recent trials have shown the efficacy of early access to treatment in reducing both the infectiousness of patients and the HIV transmission rate. Levels of access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services differ significantly between Member States. Social exclusion and discrimination resulting from HIV status, as well as the silence and denial surrounding the infection and the failure to respect the basic human rights of people living with HIV and those belonging to vulnerable groups, persist and continue to undermine HIV prevention, care and treatment, and increase the impact of the epidemic on individuals, families, communities and countries.

This is a highly significant event that helps maintain a high level of awareness of this complex illness and the worrying rise in the number of people infected. Since 1981, AIDS has killed more than 25 million people, making it one of the most damaging epidemics ever recorded. It is therefore essential for Europe to adopt a common strategy on fighting AIDS/HIV, which must be focused, above all, on prevention and providing detailed and effective information. I think, however, that the approach taken in Parliament’s resolution is not exhaustive and it does not give the right level of attention to the vulnerability of women to this illness. The number of women with HIV in Europe is constantly increasing: women account for some 35% of new diagnoses, in fact. Various studies have also shown that women are doubly at risk of infection through unprotected relations compared with men, which is due in equal measure to cultural restrictions and to women’s greater biological vulnerability. I think, therefore, that the resolution ought to have emphasised the initiatives that could be brought in to improve this situation.</p>

Although research has come very far over the last 20 years, it has not succeeded in stopping the spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, an estimated 30% of people living with HIV are unaware that they are carriers. The European Parliament has therefore called for strong measures to support research in this field.

Within the Union, over 30% of HIV-positive people do not know that they are carriers, and the figure is as high as 70% in neighbouring countries. These figures are cause for alarm and make us realise the urgency of an appropriate response at European and international levels. The fight against HIV/AIDS must remain firmly at the top of the European health care agenda. The EU and its Member States must step up their prevention, testing and awareness campaigns in order to halt this scourge.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour because I consider a complete and early diagnosis of the HIV virus to be of fundamental importance in fighting its spread. Indeed, prompt treatment can reduce the patient’s infectivity and cut the rate of HIV transmission up to 96%. Prevention and information are still the cornerstones of suitable and effective health care to protect patients. I also see this resolution in light of the specific context of defending the right to health of the immigrant population, whom must be guaranteed the best possible level of assistance and treatment. We must remember that the UNAIDS 2011 Report claims that 68% of the global population affected by HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, the starting point for substantial flows of immigrants heading towards Europe. Furthermore, migration often means that migrants become marginalised and exposed to a higher risk of contracting infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Hence, it is important to ensure universal and equal access to prevention, detection tests, treatment and support for people affected by HIV, as well as treatment for co-infections including tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although there is a slight decrease of new HIV infections on a global scale, the numbers in the EU and neighbouring countries are still rising. According to estimates, almost 30% of European HIV-positive people are totally unaware of their status, resulting in their 3.5 times higher probability of transmitting the virus. Additionally, half of the infected prove to be late for care and progress to late stages of the infection before even being diagnosed. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS and current prevention options – such as condoms and abstinence – have proven inadequate in handling the risks that those women face, who are married, want children or are exposed to sexual violence. The four-year action plan of the Commission to reduce new HIV infection throughout Europe must be fully implemented, with special regard to improving access to prevention, treatment and care as well as improving the life conditions of those already infected by HIV. In a broader perspective, universal access to health care, as well as to STD and HIV/AIDS-related prevention, care and support must be facilitated and key populations must be involved in the design, implementation and monitoring.</p>

This is precisely why the Commission must continue to use every opportunity available as part of the research and development framework programme to identify funding for promising projects promoting HIV/AIDS research and the development of new antiretroviral drugs, vaccines and innovative microbicides.

I abstained in the final vote on the resolution as a whole because those points of Member State competence received majority support.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Combating AIDS requires a global response and a global commitment, in which preventive measures and strategies are the key to reducing the number of people infected. Information and high-quality services and products to protect against transmission and to promote safe behaviour are essential for the fight to be effective. It is regrettable, however, that advantage has been taken of this resolution to include issues relating to abortion and emergency contraception. I believe these issues are not part of the objective of this resolution and should be treated more responsibly, as they raise serious ethical questions.

      <p sl="es">AIDS is a disease that can be fully prevented. Primary prevention measures that provide the necessary information, technical skills, services and products to protect people from catching HIV and promote safer behaviour are the cornerstones in preventing the spread of this disease. It is fundamentally important that the Commission develops joint measures to ensure that human rights are fully respected and human rights-based approaches are followed in HIV/AIDS policies, including information campaigns to combat the stigmatisation of and discrimination against carriers. This resolution calls on the Member States to do everything necessary to put an end to any kind of discrimination against people infected with HIV/AIDS and to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, with particular focus on vulnerable people and those infected with HIV. It also urges them to review laws and policies that hinder the running of effective HIV programmes and to ensure that people infected with HIV/AIDS participate in drafting anti-discrimination policies.

HIV/AIDS prevention through effective information is still key. As the only means of effective prevention against HIV/AIDS, condoms should be made available free of charge or at an affordable price. Likewise, free and anonymous screening should be the main focus of a European prevention campaign. We should welcome the efforts made in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Rwanda, Namibia and Botswana, where there has been a 30% overall annual increase in the number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment.</p>

      <p sl="it">The problem resulting from the spread of the HIV virus is still a dreadful reality, some 30 years since its discovery. The resolution presented today definitely has positive aspects, such as the call to bolster the tools for detecting and preventing the virus, the need to improve assistance for affected people and the plea for investment in research so that this syndrome can finally be defeated. It also looks important to have a proper information and awareness campaign in order to combat the persistent prejudices in our society. However, I was unable to vote in favour since this resolution contains a message that is not acceptable for me. I am referring to Article 22, which suggests that abortion is a legitimate way to prevent infection. I therefore abstained because, although I support combating AIDS in general, I cannot allow any concessions in favour of abortion.</p>

I nevertheless wish to draw attention to the fact that the resolution is quiet on one of the ways in which HIV is transmitted – through the use of intravenous drugs. In my country, Lithuania, more than 70% of HIV carriers have been infected in this very way.

The European Parliament resolution I supported reveals the sad statistic that today, 33.3 million people throughout the world have been infected with HIV, i.e. as much as the total population of Canada. The only cause for celebration is that society’s efforts in the struggle against HIV/AIDS have borne fruit, and a reduction of nearly 20% in the number of cases of new infections during the last decade has been achieved, and similarly, the number of AIDS-related deaths has fallen in recent years. Above all, I believe that it is important to emphasise a stronger focus on prevention because it is infinitely most costly to deal with consequences, and not only in financial terms.

However, the situation in Greece is far worse. The increase in the percentage of patients with the virus has hit the 1 250% mark within a year. The reason is deliberate action by drug users to catch the virus, so that they can claim social benefits, and uncontrolled prostitution. The necessary measures which the present report calls on the Member States and the Commission to take are the right measures, but are probably too little too late for Greece.

It is known that the transmission of this disease is preventable and adequate prevention would clearly allow the rate of infection to be reduced to virtually zero. In addition, timely detection can considerably reduce the effects of infection on health. Statistical data have shown that the infection rate can be reduced by 96% in cases of early treatment. This context justifies a holistic approach to increase the information available to citizens at various levels, whether at the preventive level or at the next level of controlling the disease.</p>

Despite the extraordinary progress made to date in HIV prevention and screening, we must remain vigilant and continue to uphold the objective of a ‘zero spread’ of the epidemic. That is the message that the European Parliament is sending out today in adopting a resolution calling for fairer access to screening, treatment and care, so as to reduce the number of HIV infections. Every year, over 27 000 people are infected in Europe, including 1 196 in Belgium in 2010, in other words, more than three a day. Although the impact of antiretroviral drugs is extremely effective – far fewer people now die from AIDS – we cannot afford to be complacent regarding safe sex or trivialise the risks of contamination. HIV is extremely complex and still raises many issues, for instance, the issue of co-infection, in particular, with tuberculosis and viral hepatitis B and C.

The European Parliament is sending out a powerful signal, including by having the sense to point out that this scourge will only be overcome through prevention and ‘sex education’, as well as through ‘strong linkages between sexual and reproductive health services’. Equally important is the will, expressed by the European Parliament, to combat the stigmatisation of people living with HIV/AIDS. Such discrimination can even lead to care being denied, which is totally unacceptable. For once, we can welcome the fact that over three quarters of MEPs are willing to commit to this cause.

Hence, as Ms Tymoshenko herself said recently, we need to strengthen the political significance, which must go hand in hand with the economic and commercial aspects of the agreement. As the document under scrutiny suggests, this must become the mechanism for incentivising development and the onward march of reform. This is by no means an easy path, as the rejection of the amendment decriminalising the abuse of power and the continued imprisonment of Ms Tymoshenko and other opposition figures show. This is not a matter of meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state, but of shrewd and active supervision of the personal and political freedoms that are basic conditions for rapprochement with the EU. Support for the agreement must therefore be understood in this light, without losing any respect for the rights of minorities and democratic principles, which are, in any case, well expressed in the document itself.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report under discussion relates to the European Parliament’s recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) on the negotiations concerning the European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement. The European Neighbourhood Policy makes provision for the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes to the participation of neighbouring countries with the objective of promoting reforms, modernisation and, in many cases, democratisation within them. Ukraine’s political and state leadership has repeatedly demonstrated Ukraine’s intention, in the medium term, to join the EU, notwithstanding the fact that it was condemned by this Parliament on 11 October for the trial and sentencing of the former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. In addition to implementing a package of public administration reforms, Ukraine has actively participated in the creation and work of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly – the platform for cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments of the EU’s eastern neighbours. Furthermore, the new generation of Ukrainians have strong pro-European ambitions. Accordingly, I voted in favour of this report in the hope that it will contribute to the democratisation of Ukraine and consolidation of the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Ukraine is a country of strategic importance to the European Union (EU). Ukraine’s size, resources, population and geographical location give it a distinctive position in Europe, making it a key regional actor which exerts considerable influence on the security, stability and prosperity of the whole continent. The EU strongly advocates a stable and democratic Ukraine that respects the principles of a social market economy, the rule of law (including an independent judiciary), human rights and the protection of minorities, and which guarantees fundamental rights. Ukraine’s political and state leadership has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to European integration and its long-term ambition to enable Ukraine to become an EU Member State, and considers an association agreement to be a key instrument in achieving this objective. Ukraine’s European perspective must be based on a policy of systematic and irreversible reforms in a number of key institutional, political, economic and social areas. The framework afforded by the association agreement will provide Ukraine with a crucial modernisation tool and a road map for steering internal domestic reforms, as well as a tool for national reconciliation, which will help the country to overcome the recent negative trends, bridge existing cleavages in Ukrainian society and unite it in its goal in relation to its European perspective, on the basis of the values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and good governance.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for this resolution on the negotiations concerning the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, firstly, because it urgently calls for this agreement to include conditionality clauses on the protection and promotion of human rights and, secondly, because it points out that Ukraine is of strategic importance to the European Union, not only in terms of energy potential, but also in terms of the management of migration flows and the fight against organised crime. The EU must remain steadfast in upholding its values and principles, which is why the association agreement should represent a real window of economic and commercial opportunity for Ukraine. However, in return, it must demand that Ukraine complies with European environmental commitments within the framework of its energy business, respects democratic values, the independence of the judiciary, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and, above all, honours all the commitments it has made under this association agreement. It is important to bear in mind that Ukraine is now on the Union’s doorstep, and that the strengthening of our ties with the country is linked to the effectiveness of our free trade area and of our area of freedom, security and justice.</p>

Ukraine is clearly part of Europe, but its sovereignty is vested in its freedom to show in a convincing way that it also wants to be part of Europe in respecting the core values of Europe – the rule of law, respect for human rights and freedom of speech. As MEPs, we also have to be aware that the people of Ukraine do not necessarily equate with the governing regime.

The aim of the association agreement currently being negotiated by the European Union and Ukraine is to establish a free trade zone between the two regions, which will not be beneficial to the populations of either of them, but instead to the economic interests of the EU. Meanwhile, the EU is also imposing a European perspective in this association agreement. This is nothing short of an obligation requiring Ukraine to introduce internal reforms and systematic and irreversible changes in a wide range of significant social, economic, political and institutional areas, which have already been undertaken or are in the process of being undertaken. In my view, this is unacceptable interference in the country’s sovereignty, and that is why I voted against this report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Since Ukraine gained its independence in 1992, the European Union has worked unceasingly to develop bilateral relations with its eastern neighbour. The countless resolutions adopted recently in Parliament are along the same lines. The association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine represents the natural progression of this positive and constructive approach. In addition to the mutual economic benefits, the conclusion of this agreement should help Ukraine to make progress in becoming a democratic State that is based on the rule of law and which guarantees citizens’ fundamental rights. Democracy involves complex requirements that go beyond the right to vote and respect for elections. Democracy entails protecting rights and freedoms, respecting due process, but also guaranteeing open discussion and encouraging debate. Above all, democracy means freedom of expression. Having a majority does not justify tyranny by the majority. Democracy means constructive opposition, a free and informed civil society, and an independent press.</p>

On the other hand, the EU should support Ukraine’s European aspirations.

In this context, an example to be remembered is the recent concern about fair legal process (in the matter of the detention of Yulia Tymoshenko). However, these elements should contribute not to aggravating distrust between the two areas, but, above all, to motivating EU action to support Ukraine, based on mutual recognition between the two areas.

It presages a new, more ambitious kind of agreement, offering even greater opportunities, because it assumes that a significant portion of the acquis communautaire will be implemented in the third country in question. I therefore welcome the vote on Mr Legutko’s report, which supports these negotiations while also expressly calling for the rule of law and human rights to be respected.

      <p sl="pl">On 1 March 1998, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was signed between the EU and Ukraine. It was the first step towards closer relations between the two countries. The next step, representing a framework for closer cooperation, is to be an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine. This will result in a partial implementation of EU law in Ukraine’s legal system, and closer economic and political ties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, it should be pointed out that the recent arrest of the former Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko, has negative implications for the conclusion of the abovementioned association agreement, and calls into question the efficiency of democratic action and the independence of the courts in Ukraine. It therefore seems justified to add a legal mechanism to the future agreement, allowing the possible suspension of the agreement in the event that the relevant provisions are deliberately ignored by the Ukrainian Government.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The future association agreement should regulate in detail matters relating to economic and trade cooperation. I think that a key issue here that requires further work is cooperation on energy matters. This is indispensable for the joint diversification of energy sources and securing the transit of fuels from Russia. It is also necessary to combat corruption among officials. The agreement must also require Ukraine to introduce a visa-free regime between Ukraine and the EU. Such a solution could be put to the test during the 2012 European Football Championship.</p>

This mysterious outburst therefore leaves some doubt over whether he will attend. At a historic moment when the Ukrainian Government and the EU could sign an association agreement with which the EU would grant Ukraine the status of favoured partner, as enjoyed by Iceland, Switzerland and Norway, Mr Yanukovych seems to want to play hard to get. I would like Parliament to reflect on this lack of involvement from the party that should have the greatest interest in attending the summit. News of the Ukrainian Head of State’s attendance at the Eurasian summit would be tantamount to an insult orchestrated by the presidential administration to raise the stakes with the EU in the final days of negotiations prior to the entry into force of the association agreement: namely, an assessment of a request from Ukraine to join the EU in the next 10 years.</p>

The agreement would add a new quality to the relations between the EU and Ukraine, and can be considered an important step towards the creation of an EU-Ukraine free trade area, closer cooperation in the field of energy, and Ukrainian visa exemption.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, Ukraine’s leadership must cease its efforts to hold Yulia Tymoshenko accountable for previous political decisions on the basis of a law that is a remnant of Soviet times and is being applied selectively. The Ukrainian judiciary must be allowed to conduct the appeal procedure under fair circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This case highlights the fact that there is much headway to be made in Ukraine with regard to strengthening the independence of the judiciary and reducing corruption. The independence of the judiciary is a fundamental value which the European Union must apply not only outside its borders but within them as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Efforts to convict a former Head of Government for previous economic and political decisions can occur not only in Ukraine but also in the European Union, namely in Hungary. The European Union must take firm action against politically motivated show trials within its own borders as well.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The exploitation of judicial institutions for party and political ends, as has been seen in Ukraine, shows that there are still obstacles to the promotion of the rights and fundamental guarantees of Ukrainian citizens. The events of last month put one of the fundamental values of the EU at risk: the rule of law and freedom of expression and of the media.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This association agreement, which also includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), is a document that opens a new door to agreements between the EU and third countries, since it presupposes a very high degree of integration, through the incorporation of the acquis communautaire . This type of agreement must serve as an example for the neighbourhood policy countries, leaving the possibility of future membership open.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The reforms policy that Ukraine is implementing is centred on institutional, economic and social areas. The strategic importance of the Ukraine to the EU is undeniable. Nevertheless, we must avoid double-dealing and forgetting the constituent principles of the EU, which are the foundation of all European policies. In my opinion, it is important to obtain the commitment of the Ukrainian authorities to restoring the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The customs union is one of the most important foundations for the free movement of goods, economic development and growth in the internal market. Customs play an important role in safeguarding the EU’s financial interests, as the importation into the EU of counterfeit and pirated goods leads to a loss in revenue and violates intellectual property rights, and counterfeit products can pose serious risks to the health and safety of European consumers. Customs today face increasing volumes of import, export and transit transactions while resources remain limited, and it is therefore important to ensure an efficient and effective management of customs procedures. I agree that the Modernised Customs Code adopted in 2008 is very important to improving the current situation and ensuring a smooth, simple and well-functioning customs system.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report drafted by Mr Salvini because I believe that it is vital to the European Union’s competitiveness in the current market. I should emphasise the need to adapt the system to current requirements. This means that a differentiation must be made between the transit of perishable and non-perishable goods. Ensuring that the European market is supplied in a timely and safe manner is a priority nowadays for the EU. At the same time, the principle of proportionality must be observed with respect to the measures adopted by national authorities. An effective customs system is vital for the development of intellectual property rights, as emphasised in point 22. It also provides the transparency required for SMEs’ current activities, thereby facilitating economic growth. In Romania, one of the reform’s main objectives was to root out corruption in the customs service.

      <p sl="pl">Modernisation of customs services is one of the tasks undertaken in order to facilitate business activities in the Union. Putting into practice the idea of centralised customs clearance, which will enable companies to notify goods electronically and make payments from their own office, may dramatically simplify customs procedures. Drafting an appropriate customs strategy, which is one of the priorities of the Member States, is also key for European competitiveness. It will help improve the protection of intellectual property rights and the fight against illegal imports of goods or counterfeit products. Another important matter relates to security issues, in terms of eliminating both imports of life-threatening materials and illegal immigration via freight transport. In order to be able to remain vigilant against the constant threat, the customs services must be placed in the best situation to ensure that only safe products that meet the legal requirements reach the Member States.

      <p sl="pt">The modernisation of customs regimes is a priority for ensuring security, protecting intellectual property, combating fraud, and updating and adapting systems to rapidly changing technology. This is a bold and reforming report. The Modernised Customs Code (MCC) adopted in 2008 plays a crucial role in simplifying European Union customs procedures and harmonising customs rules, and thus helps economic actors to work more efficiently and customs authorities to operate more effectively. However, the MCC cannot come into operation until the information systems have been put in place and/or developed. Consequently, progress so far suggests that the deadline for implementation (set for 24 June 2013) will not be met. However, I agree that it would be appropriate to delay the implementation of the MCC, since the great majority of Member States and trade representatives are in favour of this option. It is also important to ensure cooperation between customs authorities, and subsequently between customs authorities and economic actors as well as with government authorities. I agree that it may be necessary to create a European Customs Agency in order to bring this about.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of the proposal on the modernisation of customs. Customs are fundamentally important for international trade, which is why I think we need to simplify, standardise and modernise customs legislation and procedures. The different national interpretations of the EU customs legislation create red tape for business, with a consequent negative impact on European competitiveness. Modernising customs and introducing modern and efficient IT tools must be a high political priority, bringing clear added value to EU operators and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. An effective customs policy plays a key role in protecting intellectual property rights, combating the illegal entry of goods and counterfeit products into the single market, and therefore enhances safety and security for European consumers. I do not, however, agree with Articles 41-46 on the issue of preferential origin, because I think it is reductive to provide ‘ready-made solutions’ right now to such a sensitive and long-debated issue. The most appropriate time to discuss this issue will be the ordinary procedure, which will take place with the forthcoming Commission legislative proposal to review the customs code.</p>

Matteo Salvini’s report, which I voted for, concerns modernisation of customs regimes and emphasises the role of customs in ensuring security and protection of property rights, protecting authors and combating fraud. The Modernised Customs Code, aimed at simplifying customs procedures and harmonising customs regulations, was adopted in 2008, with the deadline for implementation being 24 June 2013. However, several Member States have argued against this date because of delays in setting up the computerised systems needed in order for it to function.

      <p sl="pt">The report considers that a flexible, simple and functional customs system is essential for facilitating the flow of goods and trade within the internal market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We agree that the modernisation of the customs strategy and customs instruments in the EU requires a sufficient budget for a policy on functional, efficient and simplified customs procedures. However, we do have some reservations about the rapporteur’s vision, since, if taken to extremes, it might fail to take into account basic national interests and products, such as agriculture and other food-related areas.

      <p sl="sk">The Customs Union of the European Union (EU) is a cornerstone of the EU. Since its creation, the Customs Union has been expanded both quantitatively – from 6 to 27 members, and qualitatively by becoming a Single Market. It has contributed to prosperity in Europe by facilitating trade both within the Union and with third countries. Today’s customs are facing a rapidly changing environment: evolving production and consumption patterns, increasing international trade, global threats such as terrorism, organised crime, climate change and new hazards like trade in dangerous goods. It is in precisely this context that the customs authorities of the EU play a key role. Their mission is to ensure at all times the balance between protecting society and facilitating trade through the control of the supply chain, at the external border as well as within the EU. I believe it is important to try to make an effort to modernise customs working methods, whereby the overarching objective is to maintain the pivotal position of customs authorities as a modern, responsive partner to trade, protecting the fiscal, consumer and security interests of the Union, cooperating with other government agencies, and, at the same time, being equipped to respond to crisis and new public policy demands.</p>

I believe that this is an important tool for streamlining and truly harmonising customs procedures in order to contribute to the strengthening of the European economy. I also support the view that the widespread use of simplified customs procedures for imports, which are aimed at reducing customs formalities and control before the release of goods, is one of the key elements of the EU’s customs policy. Over 71% of all customs procedures have been simplified, but those procedures have led to unjustified levels of losses to the Union budget and breaches in the EU’s trade policy. European economic competitiveness is of paramount importance, especially with a view to revitalising the internal market.

Understanding, at a time of crisis like the present, that we need greater flexibility and simpler trade processes for European business owners should lead to a political and economic awareness that is geared more closely to resolving particular problems. However, I think it is worth clarifying that greater flexibility does not run contrary to ongoing strictness in terms of checks and the safety of products that go through the customs systems of Member States.

      <p sl="it">Customs has an increasingly significant role to play in improving and influencing competitiveness in the European Union. Simultaneously, it plays an essential role in ensuring efficient safety checks, protecting intellectual property rights and contributing to the fight against fraud. We agree with the rapporteur, Mr Salvini, on the need to modernise customs and to improve cooperation among the various stakeholders and institutions in the area of customs – including traders, customs authorities, other governmental agencies, the Commission and Parliament – which is essential if we are to guarantee that customs fulfils its mission We are therefore in favour of prompt and transparent flows of information between all the parties involved. We also believe that it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance between customs controls designed to ensure safety and the smooth movement of legitimate goods. However, we will need to ensure cooperation between all customs authorities, as well as between customs authorities, operators and other governmental authorities. Accordingly, we strongly support the idea of coordinated border management and the single window, one-stop shop and centralised customs clearance principles. We also support the creation of a European Customs Agency charged with dealing with customs issues.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection’s own-initiative report on modernisation of customs. Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to explore the possibilities of further increasing customs cooperation and harmonising customs rules in order to improve the functioning of the Customs Union. Simplification and modernisation of customs procedures, and the use of modern IT tools, are paramount. Thus, intensifying the fight against crime and the illegal entry of counterfeit goods and products will contribute to global EU competitiveness, thereby enabling businesses to receive reliable information about the market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europe’s economic competitiveness is of crucial importance, specifically in terms of revitalising the internal market. In this context, customs play a fundamental role in enhancing competitiveness. Simplification of existing legislation and encouragement of computerised systems, making customs modern and dynamic, are essential for encouraging economic growth. Moving further forward, the creation of a European Customs Union dealing with customs issues will facilitate cooperation between the players involved, guaranteeing safety and responsibility in terms of the flow of transparent information.</p>

      <p sl="fr">An efficient Customs Union is one of the cornerstones of the European integration process and a basis for the free movement of goods, economic development and growth in the internal market. In order to play its role to the full extent, customs has to be modern, cooperative, responsive and efficient. To this end, Member States must allocate sufficient resources to customs, in particular to develop IT systems, so as to ensure its much-needed modernisation. An effective customs policy also plays a key role in protecting intellectual property rights, combating the illegal entry of counterfeit goods and products into the single market, and therefore enhances safety and security for European consumers. Modernising customs procedures should not, however, create unnecessary burdens, especially on SMEs. Consistency in the management of the European Union’s external borders is essential. We must ensure greater harmonisation of customs control systems and sanctions.</p>

      <p sl="de">The removal of the EU’s internal borders has given the customs service a completely new significance, which is why it would seem high time to modernise it. Ensuring the security of the international supply chain has gained greater importance, while the original function of customs, namely, the levying of excise duties, is almost solely relevant at external borders. The fact is that the requisite IT measures are unable to cope with current requirements, leading to a delay in the application of the Modernised Customs Code. I voted against the report because I do not agree with the rapporteur’s recommendation that the 27 customs authorities should be brought together to form a single organisation.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mr Salvini’s report because modernising customs is in line with the legislative simplification that we are addressing in all areas. Simplifying customs procedures improves the efficiency of controls and the application of standards. Furthermore, harmonisation between the EU’s 27 customs administrations – which ought to function as if they were a single entity in order to improve information transparency and speed up its transmission – helps controls by contributing to the fight against fraud. Cooperation between the various stakeholders and institutions in the customs sector and uniform treatment across the European Union are essential for ensuring that customs carry out their role as well as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this resolution, which emphasises the importance of ensuring that legitimate customs checks carried out by third countries are not used illegitimately, in some circumstances, to create new de facto tariff barriers to goods originating in the European Union. Particularly in the current economic climate, we must fight against any such potential tariff barriers</p>

      <p sl="pt">By introducing a control system for products entering the common market, customs ensure the security of goods moving within the European area but also form barriers to the free movement of goods. Hence, legislation must swing between two opposing preoccupations: defending Europe’s competitiveness without infringing central tenets of EU action.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Modernised Customs Code, introduced in 2008, aimed to meet this objective by introducing control methods marked by simpler procedures. However, its potential has still not been fully realised as certain other actions are also needed before it can be properly implemented. This is an area that requires maximum cooperation between the various Member States so as to ensure uniform implementation of Union law. These are the points which I saw addressed in the resolution awaiting approval by the European Parliament, and that is why I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="it">I support the own-initiative report on postponing the implementation of the regulation on the Modernised Customs Code until 2016, though it was supposed to come into force in 2013. The main reasons for this relate to the lack of software needed to tie together the customs activities of the Member States and, above all, businesses in the sector that trade with third countries. This would have led to the risk of illegal imports of counterfeit or unsafe goods to the EU, or to delays and setbacks, which would have wreaked significant economic damage on our industries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This report provides an opportunity to underline the crucial and multifaceted role of the customs authorities. They are, in fact, responsible for the day-to-day safety of goods and persons; they have to ensure compliance with intellectual property rights, health regulations, immigration rules, product safety, and so on. Moreover, they do all this without impeding freedom of movement within the European Union. I must, however, highlight one problem common to customs authorities in the Member States: the lack of resources. Let us be realistic: we cannot ask them to guard the fort and to deal with every single situation, while at the same time reducing their financial and human resources. This is why I would like to increase customs cooperation and funding, so as to support their efforts to switch to electronic procedures and streamline inspections. That is the price that we have to pay in order to ensure effective and satisfactory protection for our citizens and our businesses.</p>

The EU’s Modernised Customs Code, which was adopted in 2008, is highly ambitious in terms of deadlines, but the new proposal must aim at genuinely improving the current situation, bringing clear added value for EU operators and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. We need to step up the fight against breaches of customs regulations and against the threats posed by smuggling, organised crime, corruption, terrorism and other criminal acts. These goals can be reached by paying particular attention to implementing the recommendations of the World Customs Organisation on risk management, the protection and security of legal trade, developing partnerships with business in the area of customs automation, and on the fight against corruption.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the modernisation of customs as this service has a crucial role in guaranteeing safety and security, protecting consumers and the environment, ensuring complete revenue collection, strengthening the fight against fraud and corruption, and ensuring respect for intellectual property rights. A practical, simple and effective customs system is vital for facilitating the movement of goods and trade on the internal market, especially for SMEs, An effective customs policy plays a key role in ensuring the safety and security of European consumers. The customs service today faces increasing volumes of import, export and transit transactions, and e-customs is one of the main aspects for modernising and simplifying the customs service. I think that modernising the EU’s customs strategy and customs instruments should be a high political priority, supported by an ample budget. We welcome the Commission’s initiative to promote the adoption of e-invoicing at EU level, a measure which will help simplify transactions and reduce tax fraud. We call on the Commission to submit to the European Parliament by June 2012 a report on the current status of compliance by Member States with EU customs legislation, including an action plan to rectify any shortcomings identified.</p>
