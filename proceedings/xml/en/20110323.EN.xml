      <p sl="unknown">A second piece of information is that there is disturbing news coming from countries in our distant neighbourhood: Bahrain, Syria and Yemen. In all of these countries, force has been used to suppress demonstrations being made by people who are demanding democratic change.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Governments which use guns against their own citizens lose all democratic legitimacy. The violence must be halted, and those responsible put on trial.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The next piece of information: I would like to inform you that we have received notice, today, of the resignation from Parliament of one of our fellow Members – Mr Thaler. A second Member, Mr Strasser, has notified his intention to resign from Parliament in the next few days. A third Member – Mr Severin – has left the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and has become a non-attached Member.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">These resignations are a consequence of the serious accusations which have appeared in the press about the improper behaviour of some Members of this House. This morning I called an emergency meeting of the Bureau to discuss the situation. We are meeting again this evening to continue our discussion.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Speaking on behalf of the Bureau of the European Parliament and, I think, on behalf of the majority of fellow Members in this Chamber, we are determined to pursue a zero tolerance policy towards the actions which have led to the resignations of our fellow Members.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">As President elected by you, ladies and gentlemen, I am determined to uphold the integrity of this House and all its Members. I would like to remind you of the great public responsibility resting on us as representatives elected by the people. The citizens have entrusted us with the right to exercise authority on their behalf. We must not disappoint that trust. The Bureau has decided that we must learn the lessons of this unfortunate incident. Parliament is trying to establish all the facts. We will cooperate fully with all competent authorities to explain everything that has happened and to verify all the information. At the request of the Bureau, I will be in contact with the national ministries for foreign affairs of the countries of the Members concerned to establish what action the judicial authorities in these countries intend to take.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In Parliament, we must attend to strengthening our internal code of conduct for matters of this kind in the future, and this includes more severe sanctions. We think the recent events show the need for the existence of a legally-binding code of conduct for lobbies operating in the institutions of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has informed me that with effect from today Mr Severin is no longer a member of the group. This time it is an official notification. In accordance with Rule 211(3), the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed the following interpretation of Rule 128 entitled ‘Proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union’. The whole interpretation has been made available for your inspection. The above interpretation will be considered adopted if no objections are lodged by the opening of the sitting on Thursday, 24 March 2011. So you have until tomorrow at 9.00 to lodge objections to this interpretation. It is a long one, so I am not going to read it out. Nevertheless, all of you do have access to this interpretation.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would also like to inform you officially that Mr Thaler has resigned from Parliament with effect from 21 March 2011. In accordance with Rule 4(1) and (3), Parliament has noted the resignation and established the vacancy from the date I have just given. Mrs Soullie has resigned from Parliament with effect from 24 March 2011. In accordance with Rule 4(1) and (3), Parliament has noted the resignation and established the vacancy from the date I have just given. In addition, the competent authorities of France have informed me that Mrs Soullie will be replaced by Mr Hortefeux with effect from 24 March 2011. I understand Mr Hortefeux is with us today. Are you in the Chamber, Mr Hortefeux? We do not see him – he is not here.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Under Rule 3(2), until such time as his credentials have been validated or a ruling has been given on any dispute, Mr Hortefeux will take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and will enjoy all the rights attaching thereto, provided he has previously made a written declaration stating that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you know as well as I that the possibility of Mr Hortefeux becoming a Member of this House is being legally challenged. Even so, I find it somewhat disappointing that the French Government is not waiting for this status to be verified. Since Mr Hortefeux has not indicated his acceptance and not taken part in the inaugural session in Strasbourg, he cannot replace the Member he wants to replace.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I call for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which claims to be so legalistic, to wait for a legal ruling on whether Mr Hortefeux may sit in this Chamber or not. Otherwise, it is a legal outrage. It is as if we are engineering one.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is not the first time that our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit, who called a president – a prime minister – a dictator in the mould of Hugo Chavez, has failed to respect democracy. Brice Hortefeux was elected as a Member of the European Parliament in June 2009. That is indisputable. At that time, he was appointed Minister of the Interior. French law stipulates that an elected representative of the European Parliament who joins government may regain his or her seat upon leaving government. That is exactly …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Brice Hortefeux was elected as a Member of the European Parliament. Do you accept that?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude, Mr President. By virtue of the Treaties and of the law, it is indisputably up to Member States to name their MEPs. Having been elected, Brice Hortefeux was legitimately put forward by the French authorities to sit in this Chamber. The statement you made is unacceptable.</p>

  <section id="creitem14" title="13.1. Amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro (A7-0052/2011, Elmar Brok) (vote)">
    <intervention id="3-036-000" speaker_id="1263" name="Elmar Brok" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this European stability mechanism is necessary in order to provide enduring legal assurance and in order to guarantee solidarity with countries that are having problems, but also in order to secure the euro, guarantee the necessary budgetary discipline and enable a joint response to growth challenges.</p>
      <p sl="de">In view of the time that an ordinary procedure would have taken, and also in order to avoid a referendum in some Member States, this can only be regulated by a simplified Treaty revision procedure. However, Parliament is saying that this should not become the usual procedure and that we should actually proceed here in accordance with the ordinary Treaty revision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">The original proposals stated that this should be a purely intergovernmental method in which the Commission had hardly any role and the European Parliament no role whatsoever. Today we are able to report that, further to the negotiations that we have held with the Commission, the European Central Bank, the President of the European Council and the President of the Euro Group, in almost all matters concerning models, tests and decision bases, all aspects concerned with defining a framework and proposing a regulation for this in a Community procedure, it has so far been accepted by the European Council, by the Council of Finance Ministers, that the European Parliament can also play a part in this process and will play a role in such matters.</p>
      <p sl="de">We were thus not too pleased initially, but I believe that if Community institutions are used and we can start using intergovernmental procedures as in the past, then when the time is right it will be easy to arrive at a clear Community policy. Since the institutional conditions are now in place, we can propose to you that we approve this Treaty revision procedure from the European Council and set it in motion. We therefore tabled such amendments with the unanimous approval of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. We need to realise that our interpretations have also been accepted and confirmed by letters from the President of the Euro Group and the Commissioner for Monetary Affairs, as well as by a letter from the President of the European Council. I believe that this provides a reliable basis for our adopting this now in order to secure the euro, which has been a great success for Europe, and to move forward together.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is therefore fair to vote in favour and I would like to thank the many fellow MEPs who have contributed to this result and mention the privilege of working with Mr Brok, Mr Pirillo’s extremely useful advice and also the work of the two rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON): Mr Scicluna and Mr Gauzès, Mr Schade, Mrs Häfner and the group coordinators and of course the chairmen of the groups that have given us such significant political support, thank you.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report, as the European Council’s proposal to create a permanent stability mechanism would create an intergovernmental procedure beyond the EU’s scope, which would be a dangerous precedent. The European institutions, specifically the European Commission and Parliament, must be an integral part of this board with the Commission as a member, not an observer. Parliament is an important organisation for democratic monitoring, and the Council should consider the proposal made by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament regarding a possible compromise on Parliament’s involvement in the mechanism’s operational components. As such, I would stress the report’s idea that ‘the mechanism must not give rise to a new model of European governance which falls short of the level of democratic standards achieved in the Union’. Moreover, the stability mechanism must be viewed as only a part of the framework of solutions for European economic governance, for example, the Commission should investigate the potential of a future system of Eurobonds.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Council, which brings together European Heads of State or Government, is currently debating the implementation of a stability mechanism for Member States belonging to the euro area. The aim is to collectively ensure the financial stability of the Union, which is today being undermined. In this resolution, which I feel is balanced, Parliament welcomes this initiative, but issues a request to go beyond the temporary measures intended to stabilise the euro area. I share this point of view and feel that the EU must continue to strengthen its economic governance, in order, of course, to stabilise, but also to encourage sustainable growth.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today we voted in favour of the amendment of Article 136 of the Lisbon Treaty, which will enable the EU to establish a stability mechanism which is only intended for members of the euro area. The European stability mechanism will be aimed at reinforcing budgetary discipline and coordination of economic and financial policies of the euro area Member States, including the promotion of a joint European response to such challenges as growth, overcoming economic and social imbalances and improving competitiveness. I believe that this mechanism will ensure greater financial stability for the euro area and will speed up the economic recovery of euro area Member States. However, countries not in the euro club, which were worst affected by the crisis, remain in the sidelines, and the road to more rapid and sustainable economic recovery will be blocked. I feel that the EU must show greater solidarity and provide the Member States with full assistance to enable them to join the club of euro area countries and become fully-fledged EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="bg">As a representative of Bulgaria in the European Parliament, I voted against the draft decision because I think that it imposes double standards, which is something I strongly oppose.

      <p sl="en">The introduction of the stability mechanism for states paying in euro marks the first use of the simplified revision option in the Lisbon Treaty. This is a revision which should also be supported by countries not paying in euro, since the stability of the euro is undoubtedly in their vital interest. However, this mechanism should not be overused, in my opinion, and I am pleased we have upheld the idea that it should be activated only in cases where it really is absolutely essential. This is an important signal as regards the responsibility of states and of creditors, since it does not establish a ‘transfer Union’ in which financially irresponsible states would run their affairs at the expense of the financial standing of countries having consolidated public finances. In contrast to that, I am not concerned that the proposed revision would create the conditions for introducing a stability mechanism entirely outside the scope of the Union. The interpretation and application of the relevant provision of the Lisbon Treaty will, in any event, be under the control of the European Court of Justice. The willingness or otherwise of states to involve other Union bodies in this mechanism must be respected, and any intergovernmental nature of the mechanism surely does not have to be a priori at the expense of quality or democratic legitimacy. As long as the financial side of the stability mechanism is linked to national budgets, it is quite understandable and logical that the mechanism should have an intergovernmental nature.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report includes a proposal for a European stability mechanism, representing an integral part of an overall package of measures proposed with the aim of creating a new framework, while at the same time improving budgetary discipline and coordination of the economic and financial policy of Member States, which should also include support for a common European response to problems in the area of growth, leading at the same time to the elimination of economic and social inequalities, and to greater competitiveness. In my opinion, the Commission’s call to consider other mechanisms as well for securing financial stability and economic growth in the eurozone is quite correct. I also believe the Commission is entirely right to call for the submission of legislative proposals that would include a stability mechanism and measures for reducing risks in the interests of financial, economic and social stability in the European Union, including the effective regulation of financial markets. It is entirely appropriate to review the stability and growth pact. The report also supports the introduction of instruments for reducing macroeconomic imbalances in the eurozone, and measures aimed at environmental renewal. For the reasons mentioned above, and for other reasons too, I have decided to support the report.</p>

      <p sl="el">I voted against the report on amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro. The Heads of State or Government of the European Union have responded to the economic crisis with austerity measures and public spending cuts. These measures and policies have brought the workers to their knees in most countries in Europe, in that they take the form of wage cuts, pension cuts, cutbacks to social rights and soaring unemployment. Basically, they are being forced to pay for the consequences of the economic crisis by those who caused it. This amendment to the Treaty paves the way for stepping up austerity measures and ‘tops off’ a package of ‘supervisory’ measures which includes the economic governance package and the European semester. The ‘pact for the euro’ basically overrides national economic policy and almost forcibly turns the institution of the euro area into a tool for Germany to exercise its economic policy. I also disagree with this particular use of the simplified procedure for revising the Treaty. I believe that the most appropriate method for amending the Treaties is by referendum in all the Member States.</p>

Practice demonstrates that greater economic governance is needed within the EU, which will impact on economic and financial policy, and enable greater budgetary discipline.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report rightly stresses that temporary measures are insufficient and that any attempt to create a system outside the EU’s institutional framework is a threat to the Union project; for this reason, it also rightly calls for a more significant role for the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome today’s vote in the European Parliament on the proposed Treaty change. However, it is a matter of the utmost importance for the Heads of State Summit this weekend to honour its agreement with the European Parliament. As far as most MEPs are concerned, the process used by the Council in arriving at their proposed text is very unsatisfactory. If it were not for the fact that it is extremely important for the eurozone and that a permanent European stability mechanism (ESM) is urgently required, particularly for small Member States such as Ireland, I for one would be voting against the original proposal. The text we have agreed on in the European Parliament today is the minimum necessary to ensure legitimacy for the setting up of the Mechanism and its operation. However it does not signal any agreement by the Socialists and Democrats Group to the draconian austerity programmes expected of some Member States without reference to their economic sustainability.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Parliament supports the limited amendment of the Treaty on European Union to allow for the implementation of a permanent stability mechanism for the euro area, which should be formally established during the European Council meetings of 24 and 25 March, by the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty. This decision will help to make the financial stability mechanism, which has proved it effectiveness since being created last May, more permanent. We will thus have a healthy EUR 700 billion mechanism for providing loans, at the best rate and under strict conditions, to euro area countries in difficulty. It was, however, inconceivable that the amendment of the Treaties would consolidate a mechanism based solely on intergovernmental commitments. The Community method, which we favour, is the guarantee that all Member States of the euro area will receive equal treatment in accessing, subject to strict conditionality, this rescue fund. As for the International Monetary Fund, we will remain extremely vigilant with regard to the conditions of its participation.</p>

Little more than a year down the line, the Treaty, which was supposed to last at least a generation, is then being amended, in a quick and simplified way because of the desire and pressure from the directorate of powers led by Germany, which wishes to preserve at all costs the economic and political dominance guaranteed to it by the instruments of this EU, including the single currency. Discussion, participation and democracy fall by the wayside.</p>

However, the debate is far from over. This concession made by the French socialists is not an indicator of the outcome of other forthcoming debates on the economic governance issue. Faced with the introduction of this intergovernmental mechanism, it is important to move forward and implement instruments which will encourage recovery in growth and business. It is, among other things, to ensure that we are able to finance such instruments that I am campaigning alongside my socialist colleagues for an increase in the European Union’s own resources. We could also use the Structural Funds in conjunction with the European stability mechanism to make deficit countries converge upwards. It is with ambitious budgets and the promotion of a European social model that we will be able to emerge from the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of a stability mechanism (ESM) for the Member States of the euro area in order to help those of our neighbours that are in difficulty. This mechanism is an embryo of what the Eurobonds could be in future in terms of their ability to finance the Union’s budget and to release the financial markets’ stranglehold on the sovereign debt of Member States. I regret, however, the ESM approval method chosen – a simple consultation of the European Parliament – because the intergovernmental approach has prevailed over the Community approach. This poses a risk to the quality of democratic debate, which is nevertheless necessary in order to implement an effective economic policy. This mechanism remains a partial response which is not sufficient to encourage growth and reduce unemployment.</p>

The result is thus a great improvement on the original proposal. I am therefore voting in favour. However, I would like to set out my basic objections to the route upon which we have embarked. The ordinary Treaty revision procedure should have been required for the ESM. This would have enabled it to be set up within the Community framework with democratic participation and control. Reverting to the intergovernmental method is fatal. We are privatising (speculative) profits and socialising the losses. That is the wrong way to go. We let taxpayers suffer, but protect the banks, asset managers and speculators. The public sector is lending money to the banks here. It is the public sector that is bearing the costs – not the private sector. Without a fundamentally new concept of money and clear legal rules for the banking and financial sector we will continue to be only ever treating the symptoms, without remedying the underlying causes.</p>

However, this mechanism and the Guarantee Fund is only intended for euro area members, while countries not in the euro area will be sidelined, causing greater fragmentation of the EU. In my opinion, the EU must show greater solidarity, by providing assistance to non-euro area countries as well as countries in the euro area, so that they become full and equal EU Member States as quickly as possible, and we would thus eliminate a temporary discrepancy in the EU accession agreement and contribute to the creation of a more cohesive EU.</p>

Measures, in other words, capable of promoting a common European response, in order to better address the macro-economic imbalances between Member States and to ensure their sustainable growth. The European stability mechanism is therefore an important element of a comprehensive package of new measures (together with the European Semesters and the EU 2020 Strategy), aimed at establishing a new framework for strengthening and coordinating economic and financial policies and budgetary discipline. To ensure respect for the core principles of democratic decision-making such as transparency, parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability, Parliament must be adequately informed and involved.

For precisely this reason we must protect our currency against future economic swings with an appropriate legislative framework.

Consequently it is very important to establish such a mechanism that would stabilise the euro area and ensure its effective and efficient functioning and development. The European stability mechanism is a permanent aid fund assisting euro area Member States affected by the crisis. However, for this mechanism to function effectively it must be brought fully into the institutional framework of the Union. Above all, it is necessary to ensure that it is open from the outset to all Member States, even those whose currency is not the euro. I believe that it is advisable to provide for financial measures which would give the opportunity to purchase bonds from those countries that are facing enormous debt problems. This would pave the way for them to access financial markets while encouraging a speedier economic recovery.

In a situation like the present, in which Member States are asked, on the one hand, to implement severe budget policies to reduce deficits and debts and, on the other, to pay contributions to participate in the stabilisation fund, there is a real risk of collapse and a risk of States no longer being able to finance themselves. The European economy cannot be revitalised unless, at the same time, we use the strength of the euro on international markets and the resulting improved credit rating for its recovery.

We believe that the ordinary Treaty revision procedure should be used in order to allow for a proper and in-depth discussion about the proposed stability mechanism and other possible changes to the treaties, for example a social progress clause. Finally, we urge the Member States to enable referenda in all Member States on proposals for Treaty change.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The sovereign crisis affecting the Member States is obliging the European Union to rethink its economic strategy. The Union’s economic governance is gradually becoming a reality. There is a need for a concerted and coherent economic and financial policy between the Member States of the euro area: a true ‘pact for the euro’. Therefore, and to guarantee the stability of the euro area, this report aims to amend Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as well as to institutionalise a permanent European financial stability mechanism with the aim of guaranteeing stability and financial assistance, according to certain conditions, specifically a rigorous analysis, and the application of an economic and financial recovery programme.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this amendment because I believe it to be essential to institutionalise the European mechanism and simultaneously make it more flexible. Nevertheless, I cannot fail to underline that it must take into account the competences of the European institutions, so an institutional framework separate from these must not be created. Current events require the uptake of serious and real positions at Member State level, particularly those states in the euro area. However, I cannot fail to stress that this simplified revision process must not set precedents for future constitutional revisions.</p>

      <p sl="de">I voted in favour of this addendum to the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union because it has logical consequences for economic governance and promotes further coherence in the euro area with a view to common financial policy. Moreover, it is right that no country is given discounts and that no distinction is made between good and bad debt. The pact between generations means that the burden of debt is always passed on to subsequent generations, restricting their freedom to act and their future opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The draining of European public finances as a result of the Member States’ crucial commitment to controlling the fall in growth following the financial crisis has created significant public deficits which are subject to frenzied speculation. It required the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to be made permanent. I welcome the institutionalisation of this instrument, which clearly expresses solidarity within the euro area, and which, in return, calls on its members to be more responsible. Firstly, activating this mechanism provides assistance to Member States in serious financial difficulty and, secondly, the mechanism requires those States, in return, to reduce their deficit. By implementing a shared approach to the management of part of the Member States’ public debt and by making their economies converge, this mechanism is in fact part of a more comprehensive strategy which my political family broadly supports, namely economic governance of the euro area. We are not talking here about a theoretical gadget or a European gimmick; we are talking about a clear need and about real progress for Europe. The strength of our currency, our capacity to import at low cost and our ability to attract investment to Europe are dependent on this strategy.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Brok/Gualtieri report explicitly states that the Council – and thus the Member States – have failed to implement the Stability and Growth Pact fully and that ways of stabilising the Pact that exist in the treaties have not been exploited. Moreover, with this report Parliament gives its backing to the European Commission and unreservedly supports its ‘intention to ensure consistency between the future mechanism and the Union’s economic governance’ in order to prevent any future crisis like the one we have at present. As early as paragraph 3 of the report it is established that the European Parliament sees the stability mechanism as ‘part of a global package of measures which are designed to define a new framework, reinforcing budgetary discipline and coordination of economic and financial policies of the Member States’. I share this view of many of my fellow Members.</p>

      <p sl="en">The single currency has brought greater freedom to Europe. However, freedom must always go hand in hand with responsibility. This is where the problem lies. Some Member States apparently did not take their own share of responsibility for the common currency very seriously. They now need to borrow more money for the gradual repayment of these debts, but the banks no longer trust them. The countries that acted responsibly had a choice: allow the debtors to go bankrupt, or show solidarity. As a staunch European, I am glad that the principle of solidarity prevailed. At the same time, however, I expect the new mechanism to be applied cautiously, in order to avoid what we see happening today, with both Greece and Ireland requesting more aid on top of the original amount. I also expect that our solidarity will not be abused by those who need it, or by those who are seeking a convenient pretext for tax harmonisation and other ways to curtail Member State sovereignty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, President Barroso, Commissioner, honourable Members, I very much welcome the opportunity to appear before you in advance of the next meeting of the European Council. As you know, it will be a very intensive meeting due to the unforeseen events of the last couple of weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first run you through the main issues on the agenda of the European Council. There will be three major items: first a comprehensive economic package which, hopefully, will be adopted by the Heads of State and Government; then Libya and the southern neighbourhood; and thirdly Japan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with the economic policy issues. The European Council will, I hope, adopt this package in order to respond to the economic and financial crisis. The package has six major elements, the first being the conclusion of the first phase of the European Semester, with endorsement of the priorities for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. As you know, the European Semester cycle started early in the year with the presentation of the Commission’s annual growth survey. It brings together various policy recommendations required to strengthen recovery, to help Europe maintain its international competitiveness and to achieve the EU 2020 objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first phase of the European Semester will now be concluded with the endorsement by the European Council of the priorities for fiscal consolidation and structural reform, in line with the conclusions prepared by the ECOFIN and EPSCO Councils. The theme of this report – which was prepared by the Presidency – was welcomed by the General Affairs Council last Monday. Member States will take these broad policy orientations into account when preparing their stability and convergence programmes and the national reform programmes to be submitted in April.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the basis of the Commission’s assessment, the Council will subsequently provide its assessment and guidance to the Member States in June: that is, at a time when important budgetary decisions are still in a preparatory phase in most Member States. The Hungarian Presidency’s aim is to close the first European Semester by the time of the European Council in June 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second element is the strengthening of economic governance, and here the European Parliament has a decisive role. The Council has already taken a major step forward: the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs have agreed the Council’s general approach in relation to the six legislative proposals on reinforcing economic governance. This achievement enables the Presidency to start negotiations with this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Council has to observe a deadline set by the European Council – June 2011 – for reaching political agreement on the package. Four out of the six proposals are subject to codecision. We know that the deadline imposed by the European Council does not, by any means, bind the European Parliament, yet I take this solemn opportunity to ask for Parliament’s cooperation so that we can reach political agreement by June. It would send reassuring messages to the markets and, most importantly, to our citizens who expect us to safeguard the euro and the European economy with it. So we have a common responsibility with the European Parliament in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our Prime Minster is about to meet the rapporteurs and the coordinators who are responsible for this package and I hope that we will have extremely fruitful cooperation with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third element is the restoration of the health of the banking sector through the ambitious new stress test.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fourth is the pact for the euro, its extension to Member States outside the euro area who wish to join it, and possible announcement of the first national action plans to implement it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fifth element is finalisation of the work on the future of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and on strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), building on the agreement in the Eurogroup Plus ministerial meeting on 21 March, and you all know that the terms of reference of the European Stability Mechanism mention the fact that information will be provided to Parliament. I was especially pleased about that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sixth element is the Treaty amendment, on which you have just voted, and the formal adoption of the decisions amending the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to the setting up of the future ESM. I would like to thank Parliament here for this positive vote: I think it was an extremely important contribution on your part.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you see, real progress has been made in combating the crisis. The European Council will finalise this work at its next meeting and adopt a comprehensive package of measures to respond to the crisis, preserve financial stability and lay the ground for sustainable, job-creating growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn now to Libya and the southern neighbourhood. On the basis of the European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2011, the European Council’s conclusions of 11 March 2011 and UN Security Council Resolution 1973, the Council has expressed its concerns at the present situation in Libya and has condemned the gross and systematic violation of human rights, the violence and brutal repression perpetrated by the regime against the Libyan people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s main aims are protection of the civilian population and support for the Libyan people being able to realise their aspirations for a democratic society. Colonel Gaddafi must relinquish power immediately. His regime has lost legitimacy and is no longer an interlocutor for the EU. So what kind of action has the Council taken?</p>
      <p sl="en">First let me mention the sanctions. On 28 February 2011, in record time, the Council adopted decisions concerning restrictive measures against the regime. On 10 March further sanctions were added, including an asset freeze, a further travel ban, an arms embargo and an embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression – thus going beyond the measures imposed by the previously adopted UN Security Council resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me announce a third element: a third round of sanctions. Acting upon the mandate given by the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 March, the Council has today adopted, by written procedure, the Hungarian Presidency’s proposal to extend restrictive measures to further Libyan individuals and entities, and these sanctions already extend to the national oil company of Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">What else did the Council do besides sanctions? The Hungarian Presidency put the question of emergency supply security on the agenda. Ministers discussed the impact of the political crisis on the energy market, energy security and supply. They agreed that the EU has sufficient oil and gas stocks. Nevertheless the discussion highlighted, once again, the vulnerability of Europe and the need for an even stronger common energy policy, including measures such as diversification of supply routes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council expressed its satisfaction after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 and underlined its determination to contribute to its implementation. The Council also welcomed the Paris Summit as a decisive contribution to its implementation. By contributing in a differentiated way, the EU and the Member States are determined to act collectively and resolutely with all the international partners, particularly the Arab League and other regional stakeholders, to give full effect to these decisions. The Council and the Member States will support actions under the UN Security Council resolution to protect civilians and civilian population areas under threat of attack.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to all those affected, and of course – at a later stage – we will have to help Libya in building a democratic state and developing the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is preparing to provide CFSP support and humanitarian assistance in response to a request from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and under the coordinating role of the UN. Such actions will fully respect the UN guidelines on the use of military and civil defence assets. The High Representative has been asked to develop further planning in accordance with the UN resolution and the European Council declaration of 11 March on support for humanitarian assistance and civil protection operations, including the use of maritime resources for this purpose. Everything should be done in the closest possible cooperation with the UN, NATO and others. The High Representative will maintain contacts with the UN Secretary-General and countries in the region, including Egypt and Tunisia, and has stated that this process should be undertaken as a matter of urgency in order to allow further consideration by the European Council by the end of this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the Member States have underlined once again their solidarity with those of their number most directly affected by migratory movements, and have reiterated their readiness to provide necessary support as the situation evolves. The Hungarian Presidency put this issue to the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 24 and 25 February 2011, and the joint operation Hermes has been launched under the Frontex framework, with several Member States contributing resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me mention what has happened on evacuation. As early as 23 February, the Presidency activated the EU’s civil protection mechanism to support the evacuation of EU citizens from Libya – a decision also supported by the High Representative. Inspired by the principle of responsibility to protect, set out in the EP resolution, the Hungarian Presidency is doing its utmost to coordinate the ongoing work, in particular with regard to refugees and migration issues. The Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, János Martonyi, and Commissioner Malmström are currently visiting Egypt and its common border with Libya. Minister Martonyi has been to the border and talked to the local authorities and, in a statement made there earlier, he said that without the air strikes an unbearable situation would have evolved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now the situation is under control, thanks to the Egyptian authorities. For three days, there has been no outflow of people; some Libyans have decided to return but of course the situation is still shaky and we do not know whether there will be further outflows or not.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 3 March I was at the Tunisian-Libyan border, in the company of Commissioner Georgieva, to see the state of affairs there. The situation was still very serious: 1000 people per hour were entering Tunisia across that border. Evacuation was the most important issue on 3 March, and it is still very important that Member States help with the repatriation of non-EU citizens, mostly migrant workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the absence of a resident European Union delegation, the Hungarian Ambassador in Tripoli has been representing the EU. He is there and will not leave; he coordinates the consular and diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the southern neighbourhood: at its extraordinary meeting on 11 March, the European Council declared that democratic uprisings are bringing dramatic changes to the southern neighbourhood, creating new hope and an opportunity to build a future based on democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, human rights and social justice. It has to be stated that aggression is taking place not only in Libya: we should be aware that in Bahrain and in Yemen people are also experiencing aggression, and we have to be very clear that aggression is not acceptable anywhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is for the countries in the region to decide their future in a peaceful and democratic way. The EU will support all steps towards democratic transformation to political systems that allow for peaceful changes, growth and prosperity and more proportionate distribution of the benefits of economic performance. The EU will consult with the countries of the region that are concerned on financial and technical support for improving the control and management of borders, as well as measures to facilitate the return of migrants to their countries of origin.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council, in cooperation with the Commission, was invited to submit – before the June European Council – a plan for the development of capacities to manage migration and refugee flows. The European Council broadly welcomed the joint communication from the Commission and the High Representative proposing a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity in the southern Mediterranean, following a differentiated and incentive-based approach and bringing together all EU instruments. The Council was invited rapidly to examine the proposals contained in the communication and, in particular, to consider how the Union’s support for its partners could be enhanced.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will conclude with a rapid presentation of the ideas on which very swift action is needed. We have to increase the ceiling for European Investment Bank operations for Mediterranean countries undertaking political reform –Parliament will have a role on this issue and I count on your cooperation. We have to adopt the Commission proposal to allow the EIB to reinvest within the FEMIP funds flowing from past operations. We have to examine, with other stakeholders, conditions under which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could operate in the southern neighbourhood, and we have to adopt without delay the proposal on pan-Euro-Mediterranean rules of origin, which is essential for further development of the region. Lastly, adoption by June 2011 of the regulation enhancing the capabilities of Frontex is, I think, a must.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will stop there. I will not speak on Japan because we now have a new item on the agenda. I am sorry if my speech was a bit too long. The reason is that a lot of things have happened and I wanted Parliament to have a comprehensive picture of all the issues.</p>

    <intervention id="3-069-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as I said last week to this Parliament, what Europe will put in place at this European Council on 24-25 March will be a real game-changer in terms of economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">In other words, it will be a cornerstone in our comprehensive response to the crisis, and will mark the beginning of its full implementation with the setting up of a new economic governance framework – and, hopefully, a European Monetary Union (EMU) walking on its two legs (the Monetary Union and the Economic Union) instead of limping along.</p>
      <p sl="en">The economic policy of each Member State is now recognised as a matter that should concern all Member States and all European institutions. For the first time – with the European Semester – we have the tools we need for early and strong coordination of our economic policies and structural reforms, before each Member State sets its own policies and budget for the next year. Not only do we have ex ante coordination, but we can do it in parallel with the economic policy and budgetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first European Semester kicked off earlier in January with the Commission’s Annual Growth Survey, which presents 10 priorities for this year, all firmly anchored in the Europe 2020 Strategy for growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">They are intended to promote fiscal consolidation, correct macroeconomic imbalances, and ensure financial stability – all prerequisites for sound growth. In itself those policies will not deliver growth, but it is quite clear that without those prerequisites we will not have the kind of growth we need: sustainable inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Pact for the euro, agreed by Heads of State and Government of the euro area and open to all Member States wishing to join, reflects the priority actions of our Annual Growth Survey, but now the Pact for the euro, as it was agreed, is also fully compatible with the Treaty and will be fully integrated in the European system of economic governance. Once again I want to thank this Parliament because I believe the strong positions taken by this Parliament were very important to assure that the Community approach could also be recognised in the Pact for the euro. The Pact for the euro also recognises the Commission’s work on taxation and financial regulation. In fact as you know, the Commission is working on a proposal to tax the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every Member State, when implementing the Stability and Growth Pact, must follow the recommendations of the Commission. As decided last week, and I quote: ‘In deciding on the steps in the Stability and Growth Pact the Council is expected to, as a rule, follow the recommendations of the Commission or explain its position in writing’. This is the principle of 11 March 2011. I think it is a very important political principle that can be added to the important legislative decisions that have been taken, and also some that you are now preparing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fiscal consolidation is not an end in itself. Without fiscal consolidation there is no confidence. Without confidence there are no investments. Without investments there is no growth. But our target, as I said in this Parliament several times before, is growth: sustainable inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">For that we also need to improve the business environment. We need to complete the internal market. One of the goals we have in the internal market is precisely the different bases in terms of taxation. That is why the Commission has proposed, and has now tabled, a legislative proposal for a Common Corporate Consolidated Tax Base.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need indeed to tap the full potential of the Single Market, and the Commission will soon put forward the Single Market Act with a set of a dozen priority proposals to put our biggest asset to work, to deliver growth and jobs and reinforce Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to do more to foster employment. We need more labour mobility, not less mobility. We need more promotion of tax incentives to work and we want growth that is employment-enhancing and employment-friendly.</p>
      <p sl="en">In close cooperation with the Commission, Member States are now finalising their National Reform Programmes as well as their Stability or Convergence Programmes. Let me stress that having clear, concrete, ambitious, nationally-owned programmes is essential to the successful implementation of the European Semester. So it is now up to each Member State to have this serious work completed by the end of April.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week the Council agreed on its general approach to the Commission’s legislative package on reinforced economic governance. I would again like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for all its efforts which led to a successful compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now negotiations will start with Parliament. I know that the Commission can count on strong support from this House, and I hope we will have a final agreement by June. Then our new economic framework would be fully in place and all its tools could be used to assess national budgets, Stability and Convergence Programmes, as well as National Reform Programmes by 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, with the current European Financial Stability Fund, and by 2013 the permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM), we will have a backstop tool to guarantee the stability of the Euro area as a whole, if needed. Last Monday the Finance Ministers agreed to set up the European Stability Mechanism from June 2013 with effective lending capacity of EUR 500 billion. This is a major step forward for the European Union which the Commission, as you know, has been strongly promoting. Following our proposals, the agreement for the future ESM clearly states the central role of the Commission in the process, as well as the implication of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will be for the Commission to assess, in liaison with the European Central Bank (ECB), the existence of a risk to the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and to undertake analysis of the sustainability of the public debt of the Member State concerned. Further, it will be for the European Commission to take the lead in assessing the actual financing needs of the beneficiary Member State, as well as the nature of the required private sector involvement. It will be also for the European Commission to propose to the Council a decision endorsing the macroeconomic adjustment programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission, together with the IMF and in liaison with the ECB, will be responsible for monitoring compliance with the policy conditionality required by a macroeconomic adjustment programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The policy conditionality established under an enhanced surveillance or a macroeconomic adjustment programme will be consistent with the European Union surveillance framework and must guarantee the respect of European Union procedures, and thereby also the role of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">To this end, the Commission intends to propose a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council based on Article 136 of the Treaty clarifying the necessary procedural steps in order to enshrine the policy conditionality in Council decisions and ensure consistency with the European Union multilateral surveillance framework. The Council and the Commission will inform the European Parliament on a regular basis about the establishment and the operations of the ESM.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, I just want to confirm what was said in a letter by Commissioner Rehn and the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, to you, President Buzek. I think at the end we have an agreement that is fully compatible with a Community approach and I want once again to thank Parliament for its interest and commitment to that approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the financial stabilisation front, Member States have eventually acknowledged the degree of interdependence of their economies. The European Union has already done a lot towards repairing the banking system, but here also we need to do more. A healthy banking system is a prerequisite for a sustainable economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next round of EU-wide bank stress tests will be conducted in the next months by the newly established European Bank Authority (EBA). Transparency is essential so that policy-makers and investors can make informed judgements; so is the willingness to follow through with tough indispensable decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think after the very comprehensive and good report by Mrs Győri, representing the Hungarian Presidency, I will not now elaborate on the issues regarding Libya and the southern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let me tell you, as regards the European Commission’s competence, that we have been playing a substantial role in coordinating the European response to the escalating humanitarian crisis on the Libyan borders. We have mobilised EUR 30 million to provide assistance to refugees and migrants and, as you know, we have several teams on the ground and we maintain close contact with countries of origin and donors. The Commission’s Civil Protection Mechanism (MIC) is also continuing to support Member States’ consular operations; and working closely with the Hungarian Presidency, Commissioner Malmström and Commissioner Georgieva have also been very active on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">The no-fly zone military actions, implemented pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1973, brought about new circumstances that need to be factored in when delivering humanitarian assistance in a secure and efficient way to those in need, either at the borders or inside Libya. It brought new hope as well as addressing the need to spare civilian innocent lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">While dealing with the short-term challenges of this fast-changing and extremely complex situation, we are not losing sight of our long-term goal of a democratic stable prosperous Southern Mediterranean region based on the Commission proposal on Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s Civil Protection Mechanism is also coordinating the European Union’s response to Japan’s request for assistance. Since last Friday we have reinforced our presence on the ground with a civil protection team composed of logistics and nuclear experts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically on nuclear issues, it is important to draw lessons from the events in Japan. That is why the European Commission proposed to review the safety of nuclear sites and the comprehensive risk and safety assessment (‘stress test’) on all European nuclear sites. These stress tests should also be carried out in all our neighbouring countries and beyond, under the responsibility of the IAEA. I hope of course that the European Council will confirm and endorse this orientation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, as you see, we have a very full agenda for the next European Council and the Commission has been working hard to develop this comprehensive European response to the crisis outside our borders, but also regarding the economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will, together with the European Parliament, play a central role in the implementation of the comprehensive response to the economic crisis. We will do this always in the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty, that is, in close coordination with your Parliament. And you can be sure that we will always live up to this responsibility as well.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is preparing to meet for the second week running amid a climate of international uncertainty and tensions. There is the uncertainty in Japan, where the level of human loss is still difficult to determine, and uncertainty in the Mediterranean, as further populations rise up against their regimes, in Bahrain and as you mentioned President-in-Office of the Council, in Yemen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Inevitably, all these situations are having repercussions for us here in Europe. Our fellow citizens have witnessed Japan’s drama unfolding live. On top of the empathy we feel for the thousands of families shattered by grief, as we speak there are fears associated with the problems at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the dread of the dangers that we too could face in a similar or comparable situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These events should certainly be taken on board by all countries that have nuclear power plants and it is good that this Parliament is organising a debate on nuclear safety, though we should not lose sight of the fact that in Europe we need to be increasing and not reducing our energy independence. This is a subject we will be returning to during our next part-session.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This weekend, the 27 Heads of State or Government will also be discussing the UN decision to intervene in Libya to save the insurgents from imminent attack by the regime. I would like to highlight the fact that European States have taken the initiative in these operations and were the first to intervene within the framework of the UN mandate, which itself was the initiative of several European States. No doubt they heard what us MEPs said during our last part-session here in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group would like to see the Council take this opportunity to further develop the EU’s Mediterranean strategy, whilst maintaining the goal to help and support but never to impose. This is our duty as neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following last week’s euro area summit, at which the groundwork was done, the Council’s flagship measures this week will relate to strengthening the euro and making progress on economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of increasing the funds available to support the euro and of making the ad hoc instrument we adopted last year to help Greece and Ireland more permanent. This political will reflects the responsible attitude that Member States have taken in managing this unprecedented crisis in our single currency’s history.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we wish to stress very strongly that these exceptional circumstances that the loss of control of national public finances has brought about must not be seen by the Council as an opportunity to adopt a different method for managing European affairs. The Community method must remain the rule and the intergovernmental method the exception. A very strong majority within Parliament supports this principle and the Barroso Commission also supports us in this approach, quite simply because it is vital for the future of the European Union. I am sure that President Van Rompuy will succeed in persuading the Heads of State or Government of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Pact for the euro should also be adopted on Friday. We welcome it insofar as it introduces provisions for which we have been calling for months now, namely convergence between Member States’ budgetary, social and fiscal policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I cannot stress this enough: European solidarity will only be accepted by our citizens if they feel it is fair and deserved. This will only be the case if the working conditions are met and if our businesses can invest and recruit under comparable fiscal conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, our group calls upon the Council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the European Parliament’s position as co-legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe must get back on the path of growth and employment, and the measures that are taking shape are a step in this direction. Provided they are planned within a Community framework, they will give Europe a healthy basis for a fresh start and a promising future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly I would like to give the President of the Commission good wishes on his birthday today. You deserve to be congratulated on that.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I cannot share your cheerfulness ahead of this summit. I believe it is a summit that is taking place in the worst phase of the European Union, when it is in its worst state. It starts with Libya. Seldom has a campaign been prepared so hastily and in such an unstructured way as this campaign, which is actually a good thing and is intended to help people but which is now ending up a diplomatic and – possibly, although I hope not – a military disaster: hasty, uncoordinated, disorganised. Europe is running away from it in every direction and Turkey, our accession candidate, blocks everything. Many congratulations!</p>
      <p sl="de">At this juncture we need to take stock. This crisis has been ongoing for a year, and for the past year the same process has been taking place over and over again. At first what is required is contested, only to be acknowledged four or five months later. A year ago people said ‘The Greeks should deal with it themselves. We do not need to help them’. Four months later: a bail-out. ‘We do not need a rescue package. The amount we have made available is enough.’ Four months later: ‘We need more money’. ‘We do not want Eurobonds. Eurobonds are nonsense.’ Now everyone is discussing Eurobonds. Eurobonds will come – of that I am quite sure. Perhaps in four months’ time. ‘We do not need economic governance. Europe does not need economic governance.’ The same people who were adamantly maintaining this are celebrating at a European Council meeting the fact that now at last we have economic governance. They are not even embarrassed about saying and doing the opposite of what they previously announced.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also do not know whether we have yet rescued the Community method. I hope so and we support you in it, Mr Barroso. Not just as a birthday present, but because Europe must defend the Community method, because we can see that if we change to this other method which Chancellor Merkel calls the ‘new European method’ we will have exactly what I have just described. Everyone does something and the next day does the opposite of what was announced the day before yesterday. That is the reality. We are not dealing with a crisis of the euro; we are dealing with a crisis of the governments in the euro zone countries. There is a crucial difference.</p>
      <p sl="de">With respect to Portugal, everyone is talking and hoping that the government will be able to implement what are actually improbably harsh measures. Moreover, it is a government – like the situation in Greece – that is acting in part against the will of its own electorate, and then we have some tactical play from the opposition party which is putting the screws on the government.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Germany, the finance minister – a pro-European – comes up with a package that we all need just a few days before this summit, and then the foreign minister and the Chancellor say: ‘Well, we will have to talk it over again first’. Last Friday I had opportunity to talk to many leading people from the European financial world on the issue of ‘Does the euro enjoy confidence?’. The answer from those in Frankfurt that I spoke to – including the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the Euro Group, but also many other leading bankers – was: ‘Yes, the euro is a stable currency. The euro enjoys confidence, and likewise we have confidence in the euro. However, we have no confidence in the governments of the countries that have this euro. How can you have confidence in a government that cannot keep its word for even three days?’ That is the problem that we are grappling with in Europe. We have embarked upon the wrong course. The euro is a strong currency. It is also the expression of the economic might of the euro area in competition with other continents. On its introduction the euro was worth USD 1.17. Look at what it is worth today. The euro is a stable currency in the intercontinental competition between economic zones, but it is being destabilised from inside because there is no stable form of government. That is why the Community method is not just a subject of debate in the European Parliament, but also provides the basis for stabilisation of the currency and the expression of the huge economic might of the euro area. This economic might cannot develop, however, because it is being administered by people to whom the latest opinion poll for the next regional election is more important than the future of the European currency. That is the reality with which we are confronted.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that everything will go well at the weekend. I hope that what you have announced will be implemented. I hope that we will come back from a successful summit. However, I have my doubts and I fear that we will continue to experience what has been going on for the past year. I am sorry, but I have to say that the leadership of the European Union is blundering its way along.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would first like to offer my good wishes to President Barroso. He is an Aries like me and like Marielle de Sarnez and Joseph Daul. I have a band of Aries around me here; however, we all have something to say about the pact for Europe, President Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Quite seriously, whilst it is good that everyone now agrees that we need an economic union and real economic governance, we have to ask the crucial question: will the pact for Europe really create economic union? Will this pact really create economic governance?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I really do not think it will, for the simple reason that the Commission is not leading the process: it is still the Member States. These are not my words. I have here the text of 11 March, which will be approved tomorrow and the day after. What does it say? It says that the objectives will be decided on by the Heads of State or Government, the undertakings will be made by the Heads of State or Government and the monitoring will be carried out by the Heads of State or Government. In fact the Commission will only be involved in technical monitoring, nothing else. The Council holds all the power. This is what defeated the Lisbon Strategy and it will defeat this strategy also.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President Barroso, let me ask you once more: this weekend, what is going to be approved will be approved, but please get together with Mr Rehn as quickly as possible to prepare a real economic governance plan based on a Community act that gives all the power to the Commission and is based on a code for convergence, and put it on the Council’s table. I know they will say no. They always say no. But carry on the fight with us and do not accept this procedure or the proposal that is on the table for the time being, as it will not do the job and will not stabilise the euro in the coming months or years. This is the first thing I wanted to say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second thing I wanted to say, Madam President, concerns the Arab revolts and the follow-up of the discussion that we had here a week ago. Right now, we can make an initial assessment of the EU’s action, and I have to say that this initial assessment is somewhat lukewarm. In the first place, you will recall that in the beginning we were not very keen on talking about these Arab revolts, out of fear of Islam fundamentalism. This was our first reaction in the EU bodies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, in the Libyan affair we have demonstrated the European Union’s lack of unity. I find it appalling that all the EU Member States did not adopt the same position in the UN Security Council: three voted in favour and one abstained. This goes against the Treaty of Lisbon. Article 34 of the Treaty states that on bodies discussing foreign policy, European Union Member States have the duty to coordinate among themselves and reach a joint standpoint. Did they do this? I do not think so and I believe they even violated Article 34 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, look at what we are witnessing now. Yesterday, Baroness Ashton appeared before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I think she ought to be here today also, when we are discussing such an important issue. Personally, I see a lack of strategy on the EU’s part in relation to the Arab revolutions. Some outrageous decisions have been made within the EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For example, on Monday before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, one of Baroness Ashton’s colleagues Mr Cooper even said at one point that we ought to understand the situation in Bahrain and that the authorities were right to restore peace and order, when four people have been killed and two hundred injured. Is that the EU’s position?</p>
      <p sl="fr">To give you another example, the Union’s foreign ministers met in the Council on Monday and what did they say? They also called on demonstrators – in Bahrain that is – to refrain from any acts of deliberate intimidation. Therefore instead of supporting these revolutions within the European Union and supporting those who have taken to the streets and have fought and been killed, they have done exactly the opposite. They are telling them to stay calm and be careful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I ask Baroness Ashton to come to the next part-session and explain what attitudes and strategies we intend to pursue in Bahrain, in Syria and in Yemen and what sanctions we intend to introduce and with whom. This is the stand we should be taking, rather than the pathetic stand that many European leaders have taken so far in this business.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I regret to say that it seems that this European Council could bring on some dangerous changes, and we should be concerned about this. Under the banner of so-called economic coordination, economic governance, stability for the euro area, we see a favouring of EU-wide tax harmonisation and EU-wide fiscal unification. Parliament, unfortunately, has been playing a very active role in that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me speak clearly. The Commission’s proposal of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base is a risky step that will undermine healthy tax competition amongst Member States, prove harmful to the economy and drive business away from those who impose the policy. This has all gone too far and must be stopped.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we have also seen in the last few days is an attempt by some Member States to interfere in the fiscal and tax sovereignty of others. You know what I am referring to: the very disgraceful bullying of Ireland. We must not let this happen again.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to Libya, developments in Libya have reminded us once again that we should not expect too much from the so-called EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. National leaders, not EU leaders, have shown international leadership. Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy have made and pushed through decisions – not the EU representatives. I think that it shows clearly that there are limits to integration in this field – but not only in this field. No Member State should feel obliged to do more than it feels is right. This is as valid for foreign policy as it is for economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe must stay flexible wherever possible and not be driven by rigid integrationist dogma any more, and it is time for a change in the EU integration paradigm. That is clear. That is understandable, and I hope that the European Council will deal with that.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mr Barroso has left already but as he said, confidence is the basis of everything.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can tell you that our citizens’ confidence is evaporating as fast as the water in the tanks at the Fukushima power plant. Yes, our citizens know that certain things need to change and that we cannot continue as before. Yes, we need to halt the race towards insecurity and greater inequality. Yes, we need to break our addiction to fossil-based energy and hazardous energy. Yes, we need to return to a situation where finance is there to serve the economy and the economy is there to serve citizens; and no, we can no longer build our economies on debt, be it public or private, on deficit and on speculation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our fellow citizens know all this. They also know that this will require profound and radical change on the part of governments, businesses and themselves. They know this and they sense it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">They know that these radical changes are also complex. As Marianne Thyssen said to me yesterday, they are complex and we cannot do everything at once. We need to start somewhere.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the trouble is that from our fellow citizens’ point of view we always start in the same place: we always start by cutting public expenditure, which as we all know most benefits the more vulnerable. We always start by making the labour markets more flexible. Indeed, when people talk about rebalancing flexibility and security, we know full well that this means more flexibility and less security.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our citizens are fed up with the double standards behind this policy. At the end of the day, it leaves those who have profited most from the casino economy of the last 20 years in peace.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we want from the Council, therefore – in addition to everything that is on the table today of course – is a bold initiative designed to provide Member States and the European Union with stable, fair tax revenue. This means the financial transaction tax of course, plus energy taxes and business tax – and please do not try to sell us the common tax base as the be-all and end-all or the ultimate fiscal policy – and lastly, it means combating fraud and tax havens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Without such an initiative, I promise you that everything to do with economic governance that is on the table will collapse and take the euro with it. There is no historical example, ladies and gentlemen, of a monetary union that has succeeded without robust fiscal union to support it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">No more impact assessments, no more prevarication, no more national egoism: for goodness’ sake act!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, as regards the finance industry, new stress tests will not create greater security, any more than they will in the nuclear industry, if I may be so bold. We have seen how useless the previous stress tests were. Everything was fine supposedly, even in Ireland. What we need are new binding rules, but not rules that we are told will be implemented on 1 January 2019. It is high time that the demon of the finance industry with its predatory activities was put back in its bottle, and our citizens will not put up with us waiting any longer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the price to be paid for our fellow citizens’ confidence, and it is vital that as Europeans we have that confidence so that we can return to the 21st century with optimism and with our heads held high.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and monetary union without effective coordination of economic policy will not work. The Stability and Growth Pact has failed – on this many experts across party-political boundaries are agreed. The problem is that politics does not seem to have made much progress. In fact, no new political concepts are in sight.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me remind you that the stability pact’s 3% limit has been breached 73 times since 1999, 46 times in a way that is barely tolerable under the Treaty – yet in not one single case has a penalty been imposed. This non-functioning pact does not need to be revised; it simply needs to be implemented more – or rather, it needs to be implemented in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, every householder and every entrepreneur knows how important it is to have sustainable budgets. However, I fear that in the forthcoming decisions on economic governance and on the European Stability Mechanism it will be all about cuts. That is not the same as a sustainable budget. No state that is in so much debt as to be on the brink of insolvency can get out of the debt trap if it has to continue to finance this debt by borrowing at high interest rates. However much it saves, its debt will continue to rise – all the more so if wages, unemployment benefit and pensions have to be reduced, working hours extended, and public investment in infrastructure, education, health and so on cut back. If there is no consumption, then production will also collapse. Neither tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact nor the so-called strict conditionality of the future stability mechanism will therefore lead us to our goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">What should be emphasised more clearly in the overall package of measures is the additional need for investment in crisis-hit countries in particular, and this must go beyond small extensions of credit and slight reductions in interest rates. The mention of the necessity of reducing macro-economic imbalances will be problematic for so long as it is only demanded of economically weak states, while those that are economically strong are allowed to continue as before. Not only does the key word ‘solidarity’ not appear anywhere, but it has also been forgotten that expenditure and trade deficits on one side are income and trade surpluses on the other.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, what Commissioner Barroso has said basically amounts to a proposal to strengthen economic governance and the stability of the euro. This means speeding up the policy of economic governance in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, the work being done by Mr Barroso, assisted by Commissioner Rehn, is going very well and we see it in a positive light. We hope that this pact will be able to respond to the economic and fiscal challenges facing Europe and send the right message to the markets. Unfortunately, the markets are our current problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">This new economic governance comes after a crisis, a rude crisis in the form of the Member States’ public debt. In my opinion, with the United States printing money to an estimated tune of over three trillion dollars, I see no reason why Europe should not resolve its problems by printing money in the order of a trillion euro, not in order to pump it into the market, but in order to set up a fund, what we call the ‘support mechanism’. Be that as it may, it would appear that the time has not yet come for such an idea, not while Mrs Merkel’s ideas hold sway over Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, we must again highlight the fact that the European Union is being forced to create new systems and values under unfavourable circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="el">Introducing monetary union, without an overall strategy of economic governance and coordination between the Member States, was a risk which was tested in practice and operated along general lines. I believe that the time has come for the Union to take bolder decisions and to make the structural changes needed.</p>
      <p sl="el">As I said, of course we basically endorse the Council’s decisions on the pact for the euro and we consider that the euro is still a good currency. However, we must ensure not only that we achieve the objective of stability in the euro area, but also that we achieve a high level of growth and competitiveness in Europe and that we increase and maintain jobs for European citizens, especially young people. We must focus on young people.</p>

On the one hand, we need stability and have to do something to counter speculation; on the other, the way in which you are doing this once again provides a fairly dramatic illustration of the democracy deficit in the European Union. This procedure is more reminiscent of emergency legislation than of what we would like to see in a progressive Europe.

Whenever there is an emergency you always manage to do something that in reality increases the gap between citizens further still.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the crisis in North Africa is putting the mechanisms established in the Treaty of Lisbon to the test.</p>
      <p sl="es">Yesterday, in the High Representative’s appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we stressed the positive aspects of European Union action: Baroness Ashton’s communication that distinguishes between the short, medium and long terms; rapid application of Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council; the ability to negotiate with the Arab League; and the European Council meeting.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it is only fair to say here today that there are still certain questions being asked by European public opinion and, therefore, by our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt is absolutely right. How is it possible that, in this day and age, the four Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council do not vote in the same way but rather do so differently?</p>
      <p sl="es">How is it possible, in this day and age, that we should be discussing whether the United Nations resolution is applied by the European Union, by NATO or by the international coalition, when we are talking about the same resources coming from the same taxpayers; about the same ships and their use in the same theatre of operations?</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that we still have much to improve as regards our capacity for coordination, and much to improve too in the decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a famous line from a film, which says that ‘we will always have Paris’. Someone said during this debate that the European Union’s response has been hasty. If it had not been for France’s courage, determination and consistency – and that is how it must be put – in recognising the rebels, in sending the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs to the Security Council, in calling the Elysée summit and in applying the resolution, Lady Ashton, Colonel Gaddafi’s troops would already have entered Benghazi.</p>

      <p sl="bg">My fellow Members are right in saying that a sense has developed in recent days of total chaos or at least of a lack of predictability in the decisions and behaviour of the European Union, especially of its Member States. In particular, with some countries joining the coalition then stopping their involvement, it is impossible to reach consensus within NATO.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Not only does this situation create great uncertainty among our partners as to whether we are clear about what we basically want to achieve and how to achieve it, it also creates major problems for European public opinion, which cannot have any confidence that the European Union and its actual leaders are up to meeting the responsibilities they have towards our partners in the southern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would very much like the European Council, over the coming days, to come up with clear, sound decisions on Libya, and not only on Libya but also on the other countries where we basically have similar situations, such as Bahrain, Yemen and, to some extent, Syria. We are somehow forgetting that what we do in Libya will also be assessed in the light of our conduct towards the other countries in the region.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like the European Council to make clear decisions about what the European Union wants to achieve in Libya, which will also elucidate, to a large extent, how we will achieve it. I believe that we need to understand clearly that the situation in Libya will have many serious consequences for the neighbouring countries too, if the current situation continues for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We therefore need to be ready to provide help to both Egypt and Tunisia, not only in coping with the humanitarian situation, but also to be prepared to provide economic and financial support literally in the coming days, weeks and months because the situation there will have an impact on the economic situation in both these countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it has been said here that it is not the euro that is in crisis, but the Member States that have got into debt. That is the nub of the crisis – irresponsible indebtedness that has been carried on for many years. That is what we must now stop. That is why it is right that the European Stability Mechanism must be strict. That is also why it is right that this has been the case in the bail-outs that have taken place. That is also why it is right that Ireland is not given an interest rate reduction.</p>
      <p sl="de">This indebtedness must end. Once again I am hearing the social democrats talk of a distinction between good and bad debt. Of course investment is different to consumption, but at some point too much good debt becomes bad debt too. We need to be fair to future generations, we need sustainable public finances – and then the euro will become stable again.</p>
      <p sl="de">The pact for the euro involves too little Community method. That has been said here, and quite rightly so. I share this view.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say a final word about Libya. The Council has supported resolution 1973. We must now look to the future. I agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra when he says that France has played a very good role. However, had Turkey been invited to the Elysée summit then we would not be having these problems in NATO and the situation would be considerably easier for us all.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, all the objectives which the Euro Group has set itself, and which are sometimes completely reasonable, can be achieved successfully with the help of the economic, social and taxation policies of the Member States. The question arises, therefore, as to why we are amending the Treaty today at express speed to transfer these competencies – at least in part – to Union level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think there are two answers: as usual we want to share responsibility for unpopular decisions with the European Union, or we want to use the opportunity, perhaps under the pretext of reforms, simply to transfer more power to Brussels. I doubt this will bring the expected effects, taking into consideration the fact that most Euro Group Member States have more public debt and a less competitive taxation system than the other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Hanging over this discussion, of course, is the threat of a two-speed Europe. I would like to warn those who want to hurry. In addition to the same speed, what is also needed is the right direction. Moving at very high speed but in the wrong direction threatens to end in only one way – a huge increase in the scale of the catastrophe. At least, that is what I see happens on Europe’s roads.</p>

Tomorrow the Council is deciding on a post-2013 financing mechanism, but it does not tell us anything about the current financing mechanism, which is what interests us.

This is about showing genuine European empathy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">In the new Egypt, all citizens, irrespective of their religion, must be equal before the law, with equal rights for all. Moreover, Cairo needs to observe the peace treaty with Israel and even develop it further. If we set those two conditions, both the internal and external stability of the new Egypt would be strengthened.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I thought that you had overlooked me. Thank you for giving me the floor. We are creating a stability mechanism, a permanent aid fund, which will have to be paid for by the ordinary people, by the people who will not be getting any free gifts. The beneficiaries, however, are the people who will be getting a free gift. From now on, we will be rewarding cheats, those who break their promises and those who fiddle the figures.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ten years ago, a Stability and Growth Pact was signed with a solemn pledge that it would keep public finances in order. That pact has been breached by Germany, France, Greece and others. Major deficits have not been tackled. Now, though, solemn promises are again being made that the new pact will actually work. It will now be Brussels which decides what the Dutch are allowed to earn, when the Dutch are allowed to retire and how much they will get from their pensions. Again, the bill is being footed by the taxpayer, by the people who are not getting any free gifts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, that permanent fund is an expensive toy which allows the political elite to conceal the fact that some countries cannot be trusted in a Monetary Union. There are countries that want to enjoy the joys of the euro, but do not want to share the burden, countries which are failing to keep their finances in order. Those countries, Madam President, should leave the eurozone. That is the only adjustment we need to make to the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the upheavals that are multiplying in the south of the Mediterranean should not divert our attention from the medium-term economic and other goals that have long been set. The international turbulence should instead step up the pace for the growth of our economy: I welcome the fact that the decisions to implement the EU 2020 Strategy should be taken quickly; as early as this week’s meeting.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do not know what will happen after the conflict in Libya, but we can be sure that nothing will ever be the same. Europe therefore really needs a package of measures to permit the economies of Member States to catch their breath as they enter a new period of uncertainty. The biggest question certainly relates, however, to the situation in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean at war is the worst catastrophe that the world could imagine at present. Those countries that considered it vital to do something in these circumstances acted wisely, but we are nevertheless left with the great contradiction of a European Union that seems to feel awkward, if not actually divided, over what to do.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore appeal to the Hungarian Presidency: Parliament and I also believe the Commission is close to this Presidency, which has the opportunity to turn the crisis into something that does not end up simply undermining the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have this enormous responsibility: to transform the present crisis into an opportunity to produce, to allow a foreign policy worthy of the world to live and breathe. With our responsibilities, our doubts and our mistakes, we are on the brink of momentous events and I think we should shoulder this responsibility to the full, making sure that that the decisions taken by the Council tomorrow and the day after tomorrow are reasonable, but above all bold.

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, it has already been said that, regrettably, at this moment in the Portuguese Parliament, the government could be collapsing. If the government falls, it will happen as a result of the political instability caused by the opposition parties, which have not supported another austerity package.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is true: this is the fourth package in a few months. This is not because the previous ones were not observed: they were. Rather, it is because the conditions imposed have become worse at the mercy of the so-called desires of the markets. Portugal’s budgetary implementation in the months of January and February recorded a surplus, with a 3% spending cut and income up 11%.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The political forces that created this political crisis by rejecting this austerity programme, tabled by the government and supported by the European Commission, the Council and the European Central Bank, can be very satisfied with this. However, it is only imprudence that allows them to be satisfied with this situation, as it is terrible for a euro area country with debt problems. It is terrible for the country, it is unfair for the Portuguese people, and it is another blow to the sustainability of the great project that is the single currency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are not in a crisis in the euro area: we are in the midst of the euro area’s Great Crisis. I would like to ask my fellow Portuguese Members, what is the alternative? All the Member States have to submit their austerity plans up to April. Does Portugal, or does it not, need further austerity measures to reduce its deficit and public debt; to reduce the deficit, in 2012 and 2013, by 3% and 2%, respectively? You refused to negotiate, but you presented no alternatives. Rejection is not the solution, it is the problem, forcing further sacrifices on the Portuguese people.</p>

When a population finds itself at the mercy of a murderous leader, this is a fundamental issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A resolution has been adopted thanks to the efforts by France and the United Kingdom. We have managed to stop Colonel Gaddafi from reaching Benghazi. However, Europe’s lack of unity is worrying. Tomorrow’s Council must send a strong signal; it must support the intervention that is under way, recognise the Libyan rebels in order to give them support and isolate Colonel Gaddafi even more so that this regime will fall.</p>

Indeed, the guarantees that have been granted have been too large and too risky. They will not help avert the crisis, because they are shooting wide of the mark.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The current European crisis was caused by those who irresponsibly allowed debt to mount up and those who failed to comply with the agreements made. If we do not tackle these core issues, we can give as many guarantees as we like, but they will still not be of any help.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Under the pretext of the crisis, they want to force another noose around the necks of the more economically fragile countries, using the established conditions for the application of a European Stability Mechanism to, in fact, transform sovereign states into mere protectorates.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is therefore natural that, if a group of European Union states decided to create a single common currency, it must find a mechanism for preventing populist politicians from burdening the common currency with unsustainable liabilities – debts that are used to purchase the support of voters in the short term. The Competitiveness Pact defines certain parameters which eurozone countries in particular should adhere to. The problem, however, is with the implementation of these well-intentioned rules.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore firmly believe that the time has now come to apply automatic penalty mechanisms over failures to follow the agreed common rules of management, so that these penalties do not become the subject of political horse-trading in the European Council, where government leaders make up for their many and varied political errors by remitting each others’ penalties.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to consider two issues. First, to welcome the birth of the Euro Plus Pact, which is a welcome event. A new architecture is being born, almost a kind of economic Schengen. What is important is that it should be inclusive and open for those who are able and willing to participate and that it should not create a two-speed Europe. Unfortunately the pact will be half open because the amendment to Article 136, as debated and voted in our Committee on Constitutional Affairs has fallen. It reads: ‘Calls for the stability mechanism to be open from the outset to Member States whose currency is not the euro, but who wish to participate’. It will be half open because it will be open to take obligations upon its shoulders. It will not be open for those outside the euro who want to participate in the rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">What unites us is the single market, much more so than the euro. It is not a euro crisis; it is a crisis in some euro Member States. Any non-euro Member State could have the same public finance problem. So there is a lack of logic and a lack of consistency.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few words on Libya and the southern Mediterranean. Firstly, I want to congratulate us – in fact not the Union but some Member States who are at the forefront of the defence of human rights and democracy in Libya. We should be grateful to France and its leader, Nicolas Sarkozy, in leading the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is the beginning of moving in our foreign policy from interest-based foreign policy to value-based foreign policy. We need to follow two steps. We need to redesign the neighbourhood policy and direct it towards our societies and governments and achieve something which we call in Central and Eastern Europe transition or transformation. It is also an alarm call to redesign and reform and strengthen the common security and defence policy so as to equip the Union with common command capacities and military capacities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, 24 March, will be a symbolic day. In the first instance, it will be marked by the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon that we have just voted for, which will allow a permanent European Stability Mechanism to be established. This mechanism allows the European Union to devise the first Eurobonds, which are designed to finance sovereign debt at low interest rates in the event of speculative attacks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this respect, it is a shame that the process stopped halfway. To deal with the markets’ irrational exuberance, the revision of the Treaty ought to have been an opportunity to authorise the European Central Bank to do what the United States does and buy back public debt in the event of exchange rate tensions. The process is even more incomplete since the pay-off required is to implement the Competitiveness Pact, re-christened the Pact for the euro. This is the second symbol of tomorrow. This pact is backed unanimously by the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, you all know the Washington Consensus: you loved it. Well, 24 March sees the birth of the ‘Brussels consensus’. The ‘Brussels consensus’ is the blind, roughshod application of neoliberal dogma: squeezing public services and the welfare state; wage austerity and minimal regulation of the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the Council, the Commission and the ECB have short memories. They are proposing to transpose the Pact for the euro into the governance package so as to enshrine in our system the very policies that led to the economic crisis. In Spain, the UK, Ireland and elsewhere, the rise of household debt, which is fed by the finance industry, has been caused by none other than the crisis in buying power resulting from the pay restraint that has held sway for 20 years. The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make wage austerity a permanent fixture.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for public debt, as well as being a consequence of the economic crisis, it is also a result of pointless tax reductions everywhere, advocated by liberals and conservatives. There was no explosion of public expenditure in Europe: quite the contrary. Budget and wage austerity, combined with the interest rate rises already planned by the European Central Bank, will end up killing off internal demand in Europe and killing off the recovery without reducing deficits. Tomorrow, we will be side by side with employees demonstrating against this ‘Brussels consensus’: this is the third symbol of 24 March. If we do not want to see a return of the likes of the brown shirts, whom Europe was created to stand against, the people’s elected representatives must stand with the people to denounce policies that are as unjust as they are ineffective.</p>

It is nevertheless unfortunate that the plan is to establish the permanent crisis management mechanism outside the EU institutions. The mechanism should be brought as close as possible to EU institutions, so that they might monitor how it is used.

We, the European Parliament, have always worked for cooperation with the Arab states and the people there. Now we are seeing how the peoples of the Arab world are striving for values that we also represent: democracy, freedom and the rule of law. Who would have expected just a few weeks ago that the Arab League would be asking us, the western and the international community, to stop the tyrant in Libya?

It naturally takes time for the European Union to establish leadership, especially in foreign policy, but as we know, certain situations arise and unfortunately do not allow us all the time we would like and actually call for fast action and far-sightedness.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now it is clear that we are still falling short of requirements as far as affairs in the Mediterranean region and particularly Libya are concerned: we need to reflect a little more to recognise that perhaps we will need stronger action to understand what has been happing and also to deploy concerted action towards the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is in fact clear to everyone that if we look at Libya, there is a substantial difference between the whole of Europe taking joint action and action only being taken by willing countries, as is the case at present. No, my message to the representatives of the Council and Commission is that we are not there yet.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council has not answered certain questions, and now must do so quickly. I wonder if beyond the humanitarian effort, we really know what to do if the application of Resolution 1973 is not enough and if some countries go beyond their mandate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, I would like to know the Council's view on the issue of operational command: NATO told us that it is performing a technical role, but not providing political guidance. Do we think we can get along like that, without seeking a stronger and more united European Union voice instead of fobbing the job off onto the few who are willing?</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, two weeks ago, this Parliament adopted a brave political resolution, appealing – amongst other things – for the creation of a no-fly zone over Libya. Just one week ago, when the United Nations Security Council had not yet approved this resolution, we held another sitting where we were feeling rather desperate due to the imminent fall of Benghazi and ultimately the collapse of the revolution which is in favour of democracy in Libya. Last Thursday, one day later, the resolution was approved and it has been four days since its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Mr President, I think it is important that we continue to implement this resolution and carry on supporting the Libyan people, while at the same time protecting them from further massacres and helping them in their transition towards democracy.</p>
      <p sl="mt">We also need to tackle two other issues. First of all, we need to keep on providing extensive humanitarian aid to the Libyan people and to refugees fleeing Libya, particularly to Tunisia and Egypt. Secondly, we need to prepare for a possible mass exodus of refugees toward European Union countries. After all, this is not just the responsibility of Mediterranean EU countries but of us all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today the PPE Group meeting room was officially named after one of the founding fathers of the European Union: Alcide de Gasperi. In his time, the key to solving the crisis was a supranational approach, taking care of European common interests first. He was among those statesmen who, although born in the 19th century, were able to develop a vision of the Europe of the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="en">Reversing the economic crisis today needs statesmanship which is not geared to the next elections and does not concentrate first and foremost on national salvation but which has a care for the next generations and Europe as a whole. As for the European Council, I welcome the new text of the stability mechanism, as well as the euro area reform package.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, I hope that the Competitiveness Pact will prove credible and will also attract non-euro area members. It is important that every government makes significant national pledges to improve our competitive position.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, as with the single market, I am a bit worried that its ambitious targets have been substantially curtailed and its operational efficiency could become almost non-relevant. Therefore, while deciding on new steps, let us prove our political will and credibility by completing the four freedoms on which European cooperation is based, including the internal market, and implementing in full the Services Directive.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, I would just like to express my sympathy and condolences to the people of Japan. I know we will have a debate on Japan in a few moments, but I hope that, in the days to come, as well, the Council will accommodate any requests from Japan for specialist assistance. We often talk about developing countries, but here we have a disaster area in a highly developed country, where additional help may still be needed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second point is Libya. I do not think that any of the warm words expressed here today, even those expressed by the Commission, can change the facts that the European Union has no presence in Libya and that, at the moment, it is not even able to put a stop to the crisis in the cities or the actions of Mr Gaddafi’s ground troops.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to congratulate the French President on having ensured, at the very last minute, that the European Union was actually able to do something in consultation with NATO, but the suffering of the people is not over yet and it would be wise of us to be modest about our role. Europe is better at providing help after a crisis than during a crisis, as I have already said on previous occasions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to turn to the Euro Pact. I think that we have, indeed, taken important steps forward. Mr Barroso has dubbed it a cornerstone, but I do not think that the cornerstone is yet firmly in place, and in the coming months we will have to move forward. This will not really be resolved tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like Mr Barroso I would also like to concentrate on the economic situation, particularly as my country is the recipient of an EU and IMF bailout at this particular time. However, we have a new government and new hope in Ireland. In his very first speech, our Taoiseach said he wanted to build bridges in Europe, pay our way and pull our weight – and that is what we are determined to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are two things we need in particular to do that. Firstly, the interest rate charged is draconian and is not sustainable. We would like to see that reduced by at least 1% to 2%. Secondly, we also need a continued guarantee of funding for our banks until such time as they are functional again. We do not need to be pressurised regarding our corporation tax and we particularly do not need lectures from people like Mr Sarkozy, who seems very cosy with an effective rate of 8.2% in France, while our effective rate is actually 11.9%. Perhaps he should look at the plank in his own eye before he casts his gaze across the Irish Sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is the quid pro quo? One, we will have the austerity package in place, much to the chagrin and pain of our citizens. Two, we will consider, if required, a debt pact, like the one they have had in Germany since 2009. Three, we will also consider a European independent fiscal agency. That also is very important because I do not believe there is such a thing as an independent national agency.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is to be welcomed that the European Union’s leaders have devoted so much time in recent weeks and days to what is happening in Libya and other countries in North Africa. I am sure this action will enable us to prevent a civilian massacre and I am sure, too, that the Libyans will overthrow the tyrant themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, it cannot be denied that we also have to talk about internal challenges – challenges concerning the way the European Union and its institutions operate; challenges for internal function, common foreign policy and common security and defence policy. The difference of opinion which has appeared between some of the European Union’s Member States shows how far we are from that objective for it to be a truly common policy, one which is in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also a challenge for the entire international community. It is good that we are working with the United States and other members of NATO, it is good that we are in dialogue with the Arab League and the African Union, and it is good that we are in dialogue with Israel. I think Mr Pöttering stressed something which is very important, that what is happening today in North Africa, what is happening in Libya and Egypt, may have very serious consequences, and that these consequences may also affect the future of the peace process. We should remember this advice and be careful to heed it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also think about the future of these countries and the promotion of democracy and human rights, and not just work as a firefighter putting out fires, and we should also think of other countries around Europe where such processes – sinister processes – can occur.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in his invitation to the European Council Mr Van Rompuy states that we will begin our working dinner by taking stock of events in Libya and in our southern neighbouring countries. I hope that nobody chokes on this, but that instead we send out clear messages – and also united messages – concerning our aims to Colonel Gaddafi and to the people of Libya, but also to our own public, which is irritated by the lack of unity in the face of a dictator’s hold on power.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is right to expand our blacklist to include certain people and to freeze the accounts of the national Libyan oil company. However, I would also like to have seen the EU rather than NATO remembering its own decisions as regards capacity and capability, and being able to implement the arms embargo using its Member States’ naval forces. After all, they are our neighbours. Had we done so we would have avoided the recent stress involving Turkey at NATO and relieved the burden on our US allies.</p>
      <p sl="de">I now hope that the planning of the EU’s humanitarian missions will concentrate not just on the reception of war refugees on the Egyptian and Tunisian sides of the Libyan border, but that we will actively provide humanitarian aid in parts of Libya that have already been liberated from Colonel Gaddafi’s power. I believe this is necessary in order to make our intentions clear to those in Tripoli.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I believe that Paragraph 8 of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 provides an irrefutable legal basis for ensuring, by every means possible, respect for the no-fly zone established with the precise aim of protecting civilians. I actually want to mention that, prior to the adoption of resolution 1973, the European Parliament was one of the first international institutions to call for establishing such a zone, during the last plenary session in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With the prospect of the European Council meeting which opens tomorrow, I feel that there are two important factors for ensuring that intervention in Libya is successful. I believe that the key words should be ‘coordination’ and ‘clarity’. I am talking, first and foremost, about coordination at EU level in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the humanitarian aspects. There is also coordination with NATO: I believe that our actions must complement those of NATO. Lastly, coordination with the Arab League is very important, because ongoing regional support will be an essential aspect of our actions in Libya.</p>

This mechanism and the Guarantee Fund are only intended for euro area members, while countries not in the euro area will be sidelined, risking fragmentation of the European Union and rejection of the Community method.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first of all thank the honourable Members for a very responsible debate on next week’s European Council. On behalf of the Commission, I would like to comment on several speeches concerning Libya and Japan before commenting on economic issues. As you know, the Commission has no competence on the security and defence front but we have been coordinating the European response to the escalating humanitarian crisis on the Libyan borders. The no-fly-zone military action implemented according to UN Security Council Resolution 1973 brought new circumstances which need to be taken into account when delivering humanitarian assistance in a secure and efficient way to those in need, either at the borders or inside Libya. It brought new hope as well that innocent civilian lives would be spared.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the events in Japan have no immediate health consequences for citizens in the European Union, it is important to take stock of EU nuclear safety policies, as well as contingency plans and safety measures in place. The Commission uses all instruments available to monitor the impact, including on future safety. To my mind, Japan teaches us that risks can become reality; what was thought to be impossible must now be included in our planning. A European approach for a comprehensive safety and risk assessment of nuclear facilities would maximise the effects at the European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before drawing final conclusions, a full analysis of the accident in Japan is essential; the assessment should cover the most important issues, such as safety requirements for earthquakes, as well as emergency power supply assistance for reactor cooling.</p>
      <p sl="en">On economic policy too, your debate reflected the magnitude of what is at stake at tomorrow’s European Council and I trust that the messages sent from here will be heard and listened to in all capitals of Europe. It is fair to say that the European Union will have profoundly evolved after this March. The financial crisis which turned into an economic recession and then into a sovereign debt and banking crisis has forced Europe to seek new ways forward, to consider all possible options and to take decisions with long-lasting consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">As President Barroso said in his opening remarks, we will respond to the challenge with a comprehensive strategy which builds on the strengths, values and institutions of the European Union. It is exactly the kind of challenges which are facing us today that the European Union was created for: to be able to withstand storms together and to be able by joint efforts to come out of a crisis stronger than before.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of very long talks for several months, the elements of a comprehensive response in economic policy are now finally there for the leaders of the Union to agree and commit to in the European Council tomorrow. The Member States, and especially the euro area Member States, are all pursuing intensified fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing structural reforms with very strong determination. This is now the first and foremost cornerstone of making progress on this strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, both the Council and the Parliament are delivering on your commitment to conclude the Commission’s legislative package on economic governance by this summer. Reinforced economic governance is indeed the cornerstone of our comprehensive response.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the permanent European Stability Mechanism will be made functional as of June 2013, with the effective lending capacity of EUR 500 billion. By this decision we will have in place a financial backstop with a sufficient containment effect to clear away even the slightest doubt about our capacity to act even in the most stressed scenarios.</p>
      <p sl="en">The role of the Commission in the running of the operations of the ESM will be central, and the link of the ESM to the EU institutions, of course including the European Parliament, will be very clearly and firmly established. We shall in due course propose a regulation based on Article 136 of the Treaty clarifying the steps to define policy conditionality and to ensure consistency with the EU framework for country surveillance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, the banking sector repair must be completed, to safeguard the provision of credit to the real economy, to enterprises and to households. The next round of bank stress tests will be conducted in the coming months; the results will guide the necessary restructuring and possible recapitalisation of the EU banking sector. Before the publication of results, all the Member States will need to decide and present their strategies, if needed, for the possible restructuring and recapitalisation of their vulnerable institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is indeed essential that we see that these two problems have to be resolved in parallel; financial repair must be accelerated, banks restructured and, if need be, recapitalised as soon as possible. This is a precondition for restoring and reinforcing confidence in the European economy, improving banks’ robustness, and ensuring that we safeguard economic growth through credit supply.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, once the European Council confirms its full commitment to all of these elements of our comprehensive economic strategy to overcome the crisis, the European Union will be well on track for turning the economic tide this year, 2011. This does not mean all is fine, even less that we can sit back. But, yes, it does mean that we are prepared to face the current and emerging challenges and to prevent crises in the future.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, first, I thank you for this debate. I am grateful that most of you in the Chamber and the speakers in the debate recognised the need for the six elements which will be the European Union’s joint response to the economic crisis and on which the Heads of State or Government, I hope, can decide on Thursday and Friday. With this we can bring the crisis to an end; with this we can lay the foundation for severely restricting the occurrence of similar crises. I agree very strongly with the speakers who said that it was not the European Union itself that was in crisis but that a part, a good part, of the Member States had become entangled in a debt crisis, a debt spiral. This is what we must put an end to. This is the top priority task for all of us, for every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, we live in a single Union, and we have a common monetary policy and a common currency. This is why the debt crisis of any individual Member State is a joint problem for us all. This is why we need joint solutions. An interesting debate has started, which, I believe, we will have to deal with when we start negotiations now in an official form as well on the six legislative proposals on economic governance. This is distinguishing between good and bad debt. Is there such a thing as good debt? This is a very exciting debate. The Commissioner supports what I am saying, as we considered this in the European Council and the Council was very sceptical whether there was such a thing as good debt. Here, too, one MEP said that in very many cases a debt that started as a good debt could turn into a very bad debt.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We should continue this debate, but I believe that if we wish to extract ourselves from the debt crisis once and for all, we must seek different ways of stimulating the economy and starting growth, other than increasing debt. We should not wish to make good investments at the expense of future generations. Therefore, I think it is also important to say that, as President Barroso also mentioned, we have tools in our hands: further developing the single market, removing still existing obstacles, and the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to say a few words on the Portuguese and Irish situations. We are all aware that this will be discussed at the European Council meeting. As regards Portugal, I merely wish to point out that Portugal’s announced package of measures was welcomed by the Heads of State and Government at the EU Summit on 11 March, and it was also welcomed by the President of the European Central Bank. Thus this in itself was a positive message for the markets. At the same time, it is also very important to say that every action plan is only worth as much as is implemented of it. Furthermore, it is very important that there should be political commitment and unambiguous support behind every undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Regarding Ireland, I would simply like to mention that the representative of the new Irish Government was very cooperative in the General Affairs Council on Monday, and that I am very confident that a solution to the Irish problem will be found at the European Council meeting as well. Many people have raised the Community method versus the intergovernmental method, suggesting that intergovernmentalism was the reason for the failure of the Lisbon Strategy as well. I believe that we have made considerable progress since 4 February. On 4 February, a good number of Member States and many Members of the European Parliament with whom I spoke at the time were worried about where we were heading and what would become of the European Union if we outsourced important matters. In my opinion, the situation has improved a lot and we have returned to the Community approach. From the very start the task for us, as the Presidency, has been to try to promote the creation of a viable solution between the outsourcers and those who wished to remain solely within the Community framework.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Hungarian Prime Minister suggested and requested as early as 4 February that a reference be made in the conclusions of the European Council with regard to also implementing what was then called the Competitiveness Pact in accordance with the Treaties. I am very pleased to be able to say that we have certainly returned to the Community approach. The European Commission, one of our most Community-oriented bodies, has an important duty in every element of our comprehensive economic answer of the six laws, and therefore the European Parliament has also been given guarantees that it will have access to the information. So, we have come a long way and in a positive direction. The Pact for the eis also open and Member States, such as my own country, will be able to join if they want to. It is not an exclusive club.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, as a last request, I repeat my wish that we pursue the debate on the package of six legislative proposals on economic governance in the most constructive spirit possible. We are prepared for this, and I would like to mention that we strove to take into account the reports of the MEPs which were already complete in January when the Council formulated its position.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Turning to Libya and the Mediterranean, war and instability are the greatest tragedy possible for the people living in the region and the European Union. I believe I am quoting Mr Mauro’s words, which I thoroughly agree with. We have ahead of us the opportunity and task of creating out of this crisis the chance to ensure that a tragedy of this nature never again occurs in the Mediterranean region. I think that it is fair to say, and I believe in plain speaking, that Parliament was quicker in deciding this than the Council. In the end, the Coalition was able to put together an operation at the last minute which managed to save the lives of very many people in Benghazi.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As to the question of how united we are and how effective the European Union’s common foreign and security policy is, here again I will speak plainly. We are not one hundred per cent united. However, we have been able to agree a great many things which were essential in the recent period. On 11 March, at the summit held then, the Heads of State or Government clearly stated that Gaddafi must go; that relations must be established with the Transitional National Council in Benghazi, and that the Libyan authorities must be called on to allow humanitarian aid into the country. Already at that time we decided that we must examine our relations with the southern neighbourhood. A condition for this was the start of democratic changes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Then we already agreed that financial support had to be increased by incorporating suitable conditions, that trade relations had to be deepened, and that we needed to facilitate social changes in the region. The area where we need to progress is the three Ms, Market access, Mobility and Money. Then, on 21 March, the Foreign Ministers, the trustees of the areas of the common foreign and security policy, and common security and defence policy, reiterated their commitment. By then, UN Security Council Resolution 1973 was available. We welcomed this and we could also welcome the decisions of the Paris Summit, the implementation of which must be started. We were very quick to decide on sanctions and we emphasised our commitment to helping civilians.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The common foreign and security policy may not work perfectly but I believe that some very important decisions have been made, albeit at the last minute. Thank you very much, Madam President.</p>

      <p sl="nl">This spring summit is of crucial importance to all Europeans. Here, we will be laying the foundation for a stable euro and a thorough strengthening of economic cooperation in Europe. The Pact for the euro which is now before us is, fortunately, much more balanced than the original options. Respect for the social consultation model is central to this pact. That is how it should be, because it is the basis of our European Rhineland model.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is now time that we took the important next step, because the European project cannot be limited to a pure, bald financial-monetary project. That would eventually be detrimental and lead to popular support for Europe melting away. More than ever, therefore, Europe needs an appealing, new, future-oriented project which will inspire people with enthusiasm once again.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We need not look far, because the proposals are already on the table. In particular, we need to focus on cross-border investment in renewable energy. That will only be possible if we also open up the way for Eurobonds. It will be a shot in the arm for our economy, for employment and the environment, of course, and entirely feasible, on the basis of the Commission’s Roadmap 2050 calculations. Let us just get on with it.</p>

      <p sl="en">The upcoming Council meeting is indeed a very important one. President Herman Van Rompuy, in his public invitation letter, notes that ‘as an important step in the new framework of the European semester, we should give guidance for national economic policies with a view to implementing our Europe 2020 Strategy’. We should not bypass this point on the agenda as secondary behind the economic package. Everybody knows that the key to European economic growth is employment. The Europe 2020 Strategy aims at an employment rate of 75% among men and women aged between 20-64. Everybody knows, in theory, that this 75% threshold will not be attained without the massive participation and appearance of women on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I ask two things of the Council ahead of its upcoming meeting. The first one is to be ambitious and explicit when it comes to employment guidelines, and especially when it comes to female employment. Secondly, I ask you to reaffirm your commitment to European targets and guidelines that allow for the massive participation of women on the labour market, especially the Barcelona targets for daytime childcare, which we know, are far from being met in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that it is absolutely imperative for the investments in education, research and innovation to be made immediately with the support of all Member States so as to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy’s targets, thereby making the economic recovery a reality. As a representative of Europe’s citizens, I declare my support for Mrs Balzani’s report. I agree that the European Union needs to improve its financial resources so that it can compete on the global political and economic stage at a time when current challenges require greater competitiveness from global actors. Last but not least, in order to have a strong economy, promoting employment should be set as a basic objective. The European Union needs a skilled workforce in every area, people with the appropriate expertise and higher productivity in all its sectors.</p>

      <p sl="el">Over the next few days, the Pact for the euro will be finalised by the European Council. The basic objective of the pact is to promote competitiveness that will lead to an increase in employment in the countries in the euro area. In the aim of achieving the above objectives at European level, I propose that the definition and control of the land and sea borders and the economic borders of the Member States of the European Union be integrated into the pact. This will protect European manufacturing from counterfeit products imported from labour-intensive countries in the East. Importing these cheaply-produced goods is not only illegal; it also stops the market from functioning properly, thereby reducing the profits of European companies. This is slowing down growth and reducing the competitiveness of European companies and of Europe as a whole. In conclusion, we need new incentives for the Member States of the European Union to develop exclusive economic zones. We need a European guarantee for the entire European exclusive economic zone which cannot be contested by third countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">There is no such thing as good or bad debt; the continual rise in national debt must be stemmed. Unfortunately, the Council has failed to implement the Stability and Growth Pact fully. However, our citizens cannot be burdened with a further structural crisis. The existing national debt problem can only be dealt with by demanding strict budgetary discipline. The procedure adopted by the Member States of applying the ‘fast-track procedure’ is to be rejected, but as Mr Gualtieri has already said, if we are to come up with a counter-proposal then we must concentrate on the substance. I would welcome an initiative in which the 143 nuclear power plants in Europe were immediately taken out of the grid and sustainable energy sources were used instead. To comment briefly on the imminent stress tests at the nuclear energy facilities: since – as is repeatedly emphasised – the detailed safety arrangements at nuclear power plants fall within the competence of the individual Member States, I cannot unreservedly support these stress tests at this early stage in the negotiations. In view of the events triggered in 1986 by a crisis simulation at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, I would view such tests with great concern unless they were performed by the EU or a comparable institution and only following detailed analysis of the condition and load capacity of the individual reactors.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The rapporteur sought to insert a paragraph concerning the European Union’s decentralised agencies into a chapter entitled ‘Sustainability and responsibility at the heart of the 2012 EU budget’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I share the main idea raised, which is that agencies bring added value to EU policies in areas as varied as professional training, the environment, internal security and rail transport. However, I also share the idea that, in terms of budgetary sustainability and responsibility, the agencies system could be improved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, the agencies’ tasks and powers overlap at times, and some of them have high operating costs due to the constraints imposed by our financial and budgetary rules. That is why the decentralised agencies’ expenditure could be rationalised through a system of shared services including, for example, assistance with the budgetary process, assistance with tender procedures and legal advice.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Europe must learn from the nuclear incidents in Japan and undertake to guarantee nuclear safety across the continent. The energy mix still comes under the remit of the Member States. However, nuclear safety is defined by European legislation, which must be reviewed, taking into account the nuclear plant safety tests proposed recently by the Commission. We must not forget that the EU is hugely dependent on energy imports and that Member States need to find solutions to make provision for their own energy sources. The EU needs a common energy policy which must be based on striking the ideal balance between renewable energy, new technologies for conventional energy resources and the need to produce nuclear energy in safe conditions. On the subject of Libya, the Council needs to come up with a new European partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood countries. This partnership involves close political cooperation which will ensure the transition of these countries to democracy. Furthermore, the European Commission must submit as soon as possible a plan for managing the migrant flows, which will take into account the solidarity between Member States and strengthen Frontex’s technical and operational capabilities. However, this plan must not detract from the EU’s focus on the Eastern Partnership.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We have just endorsed amendments to the Treaty which will enable the introduction of a permanent stability mechanism for the euro area. We have achieved great success in managing to give a clear expression of support for use of the community approach as the main form of cooperation within the mechanism. The central role of the European Commission in the process of evaluating the financial situation of Member States augurs well for the future of cooperation, because this protects it from the instability which would threaten it if the intergovernmental approach were chosen. Let us hope that after adoption of the amendment to the Treaty by the European Council, it will be successfully ratified in the Member States, enabling the permanent mechanism to be set up according to plan. Incorporation of the stability mechanism into the Treaty is just one step which has been taken to improve the competitiveness of the euro area recently. At tomorrow’s meeting, the Council is also going to accept the Pact for the euro, which was adopted at the meeting of euro area Member States on 17 March. I am certain that the Heads of State or Government will manage to reach an agreement and this scheme will come into force, making it possible to step up economic cooperation in areas including employment and public finance. It is to be welcomed that despite the initial fears of non-euro area Member States, the pact has been made open to all Member States wishing to join. This guarantees, at least to a certain degree, that the mechanism will not give rise to a two-speed Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This European Council is taking place in a specific context for Portugal. The country’s economic and social crisis is plunging to unprecedented depths because of the path trodden by the European Union’s members, and of the national level application of measures dictated by them: intensifying regressive policies, increasing the exploitation of workers, new antisocial measures that worsen inequalities, increasing unemployment and job insecurity, and increasing poverty and social exclusion. It is in this context that the government, with pressure and applause from the EU, is tabling another package of aforementioned austerity measures – the fourth.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The intention of the directorate of EU powers is clear: to force another neo-colonial noose around the necks of the more economically fragile countries, attacking their sovereignty, with the anticipated conditions for the application of a European Stability Mechanism. All this, on the pretext of maintaining the privileges enjoyed by the great economic and financial interest groups – particularly those of the directorate countries – which a number of EU instruments contribute to, such as the Stability and Growth Pact, the Economic and Monetary Union, and the euro. Faced with this, the struggling Portuguese workers gave the necessary response to this in Portugal on Saturday in a great national demonstration.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of the Council I want to begin by conveying our condolences to the people of Japan, those who have lost loved ones and the many others who have been touched in one way or another by the tragic events over 10 days ago. I also pay tribute to the courage and fortitude of those who are now struggling to tackle the consequences of the terrible earthquake and tsunami, as well as those endeavouring to deal with the consequences of the nuclear incident.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union stands alongside the Japanese people at this extraordinarily difficult and challenging time. We have already provided Japan with assistance in a very concrete way. On the very day that the earthquake struck, the European Council asked the High Representative and the Commission to mobilise all appropriate assistance. The European Civil Protection Mechanism was activated in order to help coordinate assistance offered by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Within a very short time the European Union was responding to requests for assistance from the Japanese Government. The European Union stands ready to continue to answer calls for humanitarian assistance, technical support of any kind or more specialised assistance that the Japanese authorities may consider appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Council, I would like in particular to thank Commissioner Georgieva and the High Representative for a swift, comprehensive and very coordinated response to the disaster. The EU civil protection team deployed in Japan has our full support. Individual Member States have also been prepared to make very generous offers of assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important to mention that the Council will need to follow up on the macroeconomic impact of the Japanese crisis. Ministers already had a preliminary debate on the matter at the Ecofin breakfast on 15 March.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously one of the main concerns for us all is the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. I would like to stress the fact that the Hungarian Presidency acted without delay, taking into account the gravity of the events and the possible effects in Europe, especially regarding the nuclear risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">We promptly convened the Working Party on Atomic Questions and an Extraordinary Energy Council in order to assess the situation in Japan, as well as its possible repercussions on the EU, and reflect on the EU response.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline that the first message to come from the Council was one of solidarity, compassion and readiness to provide humanitarian as well as technical assistance. This message is also one of respect for the tenacity and the resilience of the Japanese people, especially those who are still struggling to cope with the situation in Fukushima.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is thanks to their tenacity in extremely difficult conditions that one can now see some hope regarding the situation of the nuclear plant, although it remains serious. The major problem now is the high level of contamination that has been measured in the vicinity of the plant.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our support to Japan needs to continue. Several Member States are making a contribution, either bilaterally or through various coordination mechanisms operated by the Commission or the International Atomic Energy Agency. As the Hungarian Minister for Rural Development, Sándor Fazekas, was told at the meeting of the Environment Ministers, for the moment the events at Fukushima nuclear plant have no consequences for the population in the EU. Radiation levels in all Member States are normal and appropriate controls are in place regarding foodstuffs imported from Japan. However, the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant calls for an effective EU response.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are certain lessons to be learned from this accident. Implementing and continually improving the high standards for nuclear safety is a top priority for EU regulators and operators; but the very concept of continuous improvement implies that we need to draw the lessons first, despite the fact that the accident was caused by external factors and not by malfunctions at the plant. Several Member States and industry operators have already decided to review the safety of the nuclear plants, which should be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the Extraordinary Council of Energy Ministers on 21 March, the Hungarian National Development Minister, Tamás Fellegi, has written to brief President Van Rompuy on the proposal for stress tests for nuclear power plants and for other countries, particularly our neighbours, to be associated with this exercise. The scope and modalities for the test should be developed in light of recent events and making full use of the available expertise. As to the scope, noting that each nuclear plant has its own specificities, the following core areas could possibly be addressed by the assessment: flood risk, seismic risk, backup systems and emergency procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Nuclear Safety Regulatory Group, with the full involvement of the Member States, will define the modalities of this assessment in consultation with the relevant stakeholders. Whilst it is difficult to set a firm date for this, it is clear that it needs to get under way as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of the safety of nuclear plants obviously does not stop at the EU’s borders. This is why it is important to involve neighbouring third countries. An assessment needs to cover both existing and planned plants, and we must make full use of international organisations and bodies, like the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international associations like the G20 to involve other countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is obviously important that the message to the public regarding the situation in Japan is clear. I have two comments on this. First, the credibility of the exercise depends on our being transparent about the modalities and outcome of the assessment. Second, however serious the situation in Japan is, we should not give the impression that the issue of nuclear safety is being addressed piecemeal and only now. It is important to recall that there has been a legally binding framework in place in Europe for over 25 years. As far as the specific nuclear issue is concerned the Council will obviously be following closely the developments and will in any case return to the matter in June.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council later this week will take stock of the situation in Japan in the aftermath of this tragedy. I have no doubt that our Heads of State and Government will want to express their continued solidarity with the people of Japan as I do now. The European Union will continue to stand ready to provide whatever assistance we can to help them through this difficult time. Once again, I salute their courage and determination.</p>

    <intervention id="3-135-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission has expressed the solidarity of the European Union with the people and government of Japan. We have expressed our deep sympathy. We believe that the courage and the calm attitude of the Japanese people is worthy of our utmost respect and admiration.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have coordinated aid efforts under the Monitoring and Information Centre so as to make a common offer of aid from the EU. Blankets, mattresses, water containers, tents and hygiene equipment have been provided by 13 Member States as part of an initial joint EU aid package. We are awaiting further offers and will be taking delivery of and distributing aid consignments in Japan in the coming days: on Thursday – in other words, tomorrow – and on Friday. Commissioner Georgieva will be present in person.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have also offered to assist at the nuclear power plant complex, but our assistance has not yet been requested. Where nuclear energy is concerned, we are in close contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and are monitoring, assessing and analysing the safety situation in Japan closely. Further information is required before we can estimate the impact of the incident at the nuclear power plant. At the moment we are assuming that the Japanese engineers and technicians and the Japanese Government will regain control over this nuclear power plant complex and that further damage from the disaster can be avoided.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are assessing what lessons we should learn from this for Europe. To this end, on Tuesday last week we held a high level conference – with all the Member States, with all the energy enterprises that operate nuclear power plants, with all the enterprises that manufacture nuclear power plants and with the atomic energy authorities of the Member States. On Monday an Extraordinary Energy Council was held, having been convened by Mr Fellegi.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must be realised that there is great disparity between the situations and positions of the European Member States as regards nuclear power plants. Fourteen countries operate nuclear power plants; for 13 of these it is part of their long-term energy policy, while one – Germany – has a strategy to phase out nuclear power. Thirteen countries have no nuclear power, of which two – Poland and Italy – are currently considering moving into or resuming nuclear energy production. With the exception of renewable energy – with its 20% target – the energy mix lies within the competence of national legislation and policy. We respect that.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation in different parts of Europe varies greatly – overall, Europe generates 30% of its power from nuclear energy, but in Austria the share is approaching 0% and in France it is 80% – but there are two common denominators. The first, which we will come back to in the course of the year, is the infrastructure. Whatever direction energy policy is to take, expansion of the infrastructure for electricity, gas and storage capacity – in terms of both quality and capacity – needs to be accelerated. Secondly, safety. The safety of industrial plants in general, of infrastructure in general and of nuclear power plants in particular is a common concern for the benefit of workers in the power plants, the citizens of Europe and European nature.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are therefore proposing that we look at whether it is meaningful and appropriate, in view of the already recognisable causes and the emerging information on the causes of the incident in Japan, to carry out a safety check – a stress test; in other words, an extraordinary test based on common standards and criteria with the aim of further reducing risk in the 143 nuclear power plants that are operated in the European Union, as well as for the building of any new plants in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Safety benefits all citizens, regardless of whether the Member State in which they live has nuclear power, is planning nuclear power, is phasing out nuclear power or has no nuclear power. This would look at particular criteria such as flooding and risks to operation and safety, earthquakes and knowledge gained in Japan, cooling systems and their functioning and the subject of power supply and backup power in a staggered configuration, so that more cooling can be maintained by means of power and backup power units even where there is a risk of earthquakes and flooding. This would involve general criteria for all nuclear power plants as well as special criteria for each particular design, age, location, seismic risk, flood risk and other factors. This special review should also include topics such as aircraft crashes, cyber attacks and terrorist attacks.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s offer to the Member States is that it will prepare and coordinate this jointly with the atomic energy authorities. This is only an offer; acceptance is voluntary. The Member States are themselves responsible for deciding whether they want to perform a general and special common stress test in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The previous speaker mentioned neighbouring states which are just as important for our safety; a central one of these is Switzerland, along with Ukraine, Armenia, Turkey and the Russian Federation. I have had a long telephone conversation with the Ukrainian Energy Minister. He stated that he would be happy to participate if there were a general stress test for the European Union – in other words, an offer on his part. It is clear that our authority in respect of a stress test outside of the European Union and its Member States will depend greatly on whether we can organise this jointly in Europe. If some Member States do not want to participate then we will have less authority when making an offer to Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and Switzerland than if all the Member States take a common view that this is an important safety task.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will therefore prepare these safety criteria in the coming weeks and we are happy to cooperate not just with Parliament, but also with all those involved in the European Union – with NGOs, energy enterprises, workers, technicians, engineers in the power stations – with the aim of achieving the greatest possible further reduction in risk and increase in safety. We are grateful that President Sarkozy wishes to address this whole topic at the G20 and therefore lessons will be learnt not just for nuclear power plants in Europe, but also for those throughout the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is the situation for our part. We will be happy to provide Parliament with information on how to proceed further at any time via its specialist committees – as we have already done in recent days in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – and we look forward to corresponding support from the European Council here in Brussels tomorrow and the day after.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been reminded once again of the force of nature and we are seeing the limits of human capability and how we are at the mercy of these powerful forces of nature. At such moments we can only show solidarity with the Japanese – a solidarity that is expressed in our thoughts and prayers, but also in practical assistance. When the Commissioner mentions that we are providing aid, trying to provide relief and support people, that is an important measure that not only provides direct assistance, but also provides some comfort. I also know that it is not just the state organisations that are doing this, but that many of the citizens of Europe are prepared to donate, to give their own private money. In my home town alone – where I am a patron – EUR 50 000 was collected within three days, and the money is still coming in. This is happening all over Europe. It shows that there is a high level of support.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we should pause for thought and not immediately start pressing our buttons for internal political purposes. Undoubtedly, however, we will look at the experience that has been had and the lessons to be learned from the nuclear incident and will have to carry out the stress test, and I hope, Commissioner, we will do this at European level – because borders are meaningless when such incidents occur. We must ensure that we create the necessary infrastructures for alternatives and that research is carried out into possible new energy projects, which should equally address issues such as climate change, jobs and competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need to realise that the words ‘ancillary risk’ will play a different role. People no longer have faith that companies will observe all the regulations and that there is nothing that cannot be calculated. Japan will change our thinking on these issues and consequently we need to rethink the issue of ancillary risk; new conclusions will be drawn and must give rise to new considerations and new policies. We should discuss this with the calmness that it demands.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, one of the world’s most developed countries from an economic and technical perspective has been thrown into a state of humanitarian crisis. It is, first and foremost, a tragedy for all those people who have been affected. The images from Japan are heart-rending. We need to give them all the support and every possible form of assistance we can. However, the disaster also demonstrates the vulnerability of all modern societies. What has happened in Japan could happen in other parts of the world – even here. Even in countries with extremely high safety requirements, this safety may prove deceptive.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Now, of course, we cannot simply imagine nuclear power away. There are certainly some countries in Europe that do not have nuclear power, but the majority are extremely, or completely, dependent on it. Some are building new nuclear power plants and some are decommissioning them. That is the situation we find ourselves in – in other words, the situation is different in different Member States as regards vulnerability, but we are nevertheless in this together and we need to take a long term- approach to our energy supply.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We quite simply have to switch our energy systems so that we reduce the risks and the one-sided nature of these systems. We must make a serious effort to prioritise research and development and investments in, and the expansion of, long-term sustainable and renewable energy sources. Europe has huge untapped potential here that should be set against the fact that the construction of new nuclear power plants will make us dependent on them for many more decades to come – in other words new investments in nuclear energy are a means of postponing and preventing the expansion of renewable energy, a way of mortgaging the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Instead, what we should be doing now is having a serious debate with regard to raising the EU’s renewable energy targets and ambitions and as soon as possible deciding on binding energy efficiency targets and a long-term plan for our energy supply – a switch to renewable energy. The collective stress test for nuclear power plants in all countries is therefore necessary, but then what is needed is a long-term approach.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the images of the massive earthquake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan are terrifying; our thoughts and heartfelt sympathies go to those who have lost homes and loved ones.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course we welcome the EU help package. In Fukushima, personnel are still working at the site of the nuclear power plant to prevent further radiation contamination, and this of course has to be assessed thoroughly all over the European Union – including in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the stress test proposed by the Commission, but I think it has to be added that we cannot just have a stress test based on technology and geography. We need two other steps. One is on the security culture, where it obviously has been impossible to envisage multiple risks. The second is on the institutional framework, including an oversight of the relationships between the national regulatory bodies and the nuclear companies. Furthermore, authorities should not be allowed to audit themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, as we evaluate the consequences of the disaster, we should base our discussion on information and knowledge. Radical measures might be necessary – I would think are necessary. But one thing should be obvious: we have to reform our energy production and to rely instead on renewable energy and we have to do it now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me express my admiration for the stoic Japanese resilience in the face of these mighty forces of nature. We must remember the extraordinary strength of the earthquake and of the tsunami.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the precautionary stress tests on European nuclear power plants, while remembering that the nuclear industry is already the most regulated and safety conscious in the world, and I note the statement earlier this year from WENRA, the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association, about making new reactors even safer than our existing ones. It is salutary to compare the safety records of the coal, oil and hydroelectric industries with that of the nuclear industry, in terms of accidents involving loss of life.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I see a silver lining in this awful cloud for Japan – namely that the rebuilding and restoration work in that country, courtesy of the deep pockets of the insurance industry, should give a huge boost to their economy and that will be good for the rest of the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course this situation requires that we should assist Japan as best we can and with all the resources at our disposal. A country hit by the kind of disaster that has hit Japan needs all the help it can get. However, I find remarkable the levity with which we heap praise on Japan’s heroes. I believe that we are failing to recognise that the people referred to as ‘heroes’ know better than anyone else that they are risking life and limb and that many of those who are fighting the nuclear meltdown in Fukushima are already dead men walking. The Japanese know better than any other nation in the world what devastation a nuclear disaster can unleash. Their history is dominated by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Every child in Japan is aware of the consequences of nuclear meltdown. We should be aware of this when we come to discuss Japan. The Japanese know better than anyone else all the horror entailed not just in this situation, but also in what is yet to come. Perhaps the Ukrainians, who have witnessed the devastation of part of their country for the last 25 years, are the only others qualified to speak about this.</p>
      <p sl="de">For me, current European discussions, unlike those of 25 years ago, should consider the political implications when we discover that in our own countries we have a technology that can get out of control, not just annihilating the past in certain regions or destroying the present, but also reaching insidiously into the future of all those living in the vicinity of these plants, as well as in the wider environs. I do not believe that we are doing this when we talk about stress tests, Mr Oettinger. We must be much more honest and should admit that we in the European Union have frequently been confronted with situations verging on nuclear meltdown in the plants that we operate. Let me give you a short list: Tihange in Belgium, Civaux in France, Philippsburg in Germany, Kozloduy in Bulgaria, Paks in Hungary, Brunsbüttel in Germany, where there was a hydrogen explosion, Forsmark in Sweden, Barsebäck in Sweden, Blayais in France, Krümmel in Germany – this is a list of the most striking incidents that have occurred, with a range of different causes, since Chernobyl, where we have found ourselves on the threshold of nuclear meltdown.</p>
      <p sl="de">How are we to deal with the fact that a nuclear meltdown could occur in any of the plants that we operate? Are we to do this through stress tests? In my opinion, these tests are only relevant if they lead us to produce a plan indicating which plants and which defined risks are to be the first to go as we turn our backs on this high-risk technology. If these stress tests are intended to reassure the public and once again to suggest that we in Europe could never be faced with situations like those currently experienced in Japan, then I believe that these tests are wrong. By the way, we would very much welcome the opportunity to have a say in deciding who defines the stress tests – this matter cannot be left to the nuclear power plant operators themselves – as well as who implements the tests and evaluates them. The hitherto responsible authorities have turned a blind eye far too often to the difficulties encountered in European plants and have approved plants that never should have passed the conformity assessment procedure, as Euratom did in the cases of Belene and Mochovce, for example.</p>

The behaviour of the Japanese people is truly an inspiration to all and they deserve our help.</p>
      <p sl="it">The lesson to be learned from this experience is the need to strengthen the European civil protection system through more closely coordinated action and the wider availability of people and resources so that we can act quickly in the event of disaster.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the nuclear option, it would be a mistake to discuss this topic on the emotional tide of current events: the subject is too important and must be addressed with a scientific approach. It is absolutely right to strengthen security measures for present and next-generation power stations and to dismantle those that are older and more unsafe, but we must avoid political exploitation and be cautious and pragmatic, as Mr Brok said. We should remember that in the same Fukushima area, a dam collapsed during the earthquake with many casualties, but this does not lead us to think of dismantling dams or building new ones, hence I call for caution, attention and openness to the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the terrible disaster which struck the Tōhoku region in the north-east of Japan has naturally aroused compassion and sympathy on the part of all Europeans. Beyond that feeling, we must of course participate in the rescue effort because the situation is, I believe, far from being stabilised in Japan. Japan is a remarkable country, an extremely dignified, strong and brave country, which is aware of its duties, but where bureaucracy has, as elsewhere, effects that can paralyse initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the lessons to be learned from this disaster is that the most effective emergency relief is, in the end, the one that arrives by sea. Of course, this requires there to be sufficient facilities nearby.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The situation is not stabilised and many homeless people are still suffering from the cold and from hunger. We believe that the lessons from this tragedy are the following: the first is that the worst always happens, the worst always ends up happening. The Titanic was built to be an unsinkable ship. ‘Even God could not sink it’ was what was said about it. Yet it sank on its maiden voyage, despite the watertight caissons, because the engineers did not think there could be a leak on that scale.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Well, the worst always happens, the earthquake plus the tsunami, this was, of course, the worst scenario. However, there will be other earthquakes, there will be the big Kanto earthquake that we are expecting at any moment. There might be one in California, in Italy or in the Caribbean. Therefore, as has been said, we need to be prepared for this by enhancing civil protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second and final lesson is that we must nevertheless not give in to panic. We cannot, at the same time, be told that we must forsake nuclear energy on the grounds that radioactive fallout is dangerous, while also being told that we should stop using fossil fuels because CO2 is being discharged into the atmosphere. A choice will have to be made.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, the misfortune that the Japanese people have experienced is immense. I should like to put on record my deepest sympathy for the families of those who have suffered and those who have died, and their near ones. The nobility and composure exhibited by the Japanese people in this time of trial is worthy of the greatest respect and is an example for the whole world. Japan is faced with an intensive task of restoring its devastated territories, which will require significant resources, including inward investment. That is why I call for the European Union-Japan summit scheduled for 25 May to take the decision to begin negotiations on a free trade agreement between the European Union and Japan. This agreement would have to be of benefit to both parties; it would have to guarantee equal market access conditions to both partners, both in the flow of goods and services and in relation to agricultural products. A free trade agreement could become one of the instruments for the third opening of Japan, as Japan’s Prime Minister, Mr Kan, has picturesquely termed it. The accident caused by the tsunami at the Fukushima nuclear power station is a cause of serious alarm throughout the world. We must bow our heads in respect and gratitude to those heroes who are working, at the risk of their own lives, to stabilise the situation in the nuclear reactor. The experience currently being gained by the Japanese engineers and nuclear power experts in accident prevention is unique. It is important for the world to learn from this experience. The experience of Fukushima must be of service to humanity, by becoming the basis for testing nuclear power stations and the development of improved safety criteria. In conclusion, I should again wish to confirm that the European Union must do everything possible to help Japan, one of our closest partners. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, two themes have emerged in the aftermath of the tragic events which struck Japan 12 days ago. The first has been the Japanese response which, in terms of structural preparation in the cities, the rapid response of the emergency units and the inspirational resilience shown by the Japanese people, has been exemplary and should serve as a template for other earthquake-prone countries. However, the second theme, that of the nuclear fallout in Fukushima, is more difficult.</p>
      <p sl="en">While Japan will undoubtedly learn swiftly from these events, Europe too must take these lessons on board and our reaction might be broken up into two areas. The first is to secure beyond doubt the safety of nuclear power plants operating in the EU. I welcome plans for tests and would like to stress that they must conclude with common rules between Member States on the security of nuclear power plants and on the storing of highly toxic nuclear waste. This is particularly pertinent in my Ireland East constituency. The largest collection of such material is housed at Sellafield nuclear plant in England just 280 kilometres from County Louth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our second response should concern the future of nuclear power as a whole. In this regard, a complete halt to the construction of new nuclear power plants must be agreed. In order to ensure the continued provision of sufficient energy for the EU, investments in renewable energy production and increased energy efficiency must also be approved.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, just 14 days ago, the Japanese company Toshiba and others that built nuclear power stations wrote in their promotional brochures that they had the safest nuclear power stations in the world – so much for the claim that we in Europe definitely have the safest atomic energy plants.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that this extremely serious and tragic accident in Japan should make it clear how absurd it is to equate nuclear power stations with wind farms, energy efficiency or solar power plants when discussing the fight against climate change. What is more, this idea of low carbon technology is simply wrong. One needs to look at the overall risk from all technologies. My first specific question to you, Mr Oettinger, is as follows: is it not high time for you to include at least one scenario in the Energy Roadmap 2050 that simply shows what we can achieve by combining 100% renewable energy and energy efficiency? That is the very least that the citizens of Europe can expect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me state, with regard to the stress tests, that we are in favour of such tests, but they must be mandatory and they must be European. The first bank stress test was manipulated excessively by the national authorities so that a couple of banks would be excluded. We needed a second round of stress tests to get things right. The second key element is ‘independent expertise’. Mrs Lauvergeon from Areva and Mr Teyssen from E.ON, the Euratom officials from the Commission, the nuclear experts in Vienna, and indeed the national nuclear watchdogs are all biased. Even the national authorities will not admit that the safety tests outlined six months ago are no longer correct. In other words, we need independent experts. Otherwise you run the risk of hearing only biased opinions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one final word to add. I would recommend caution, Mr Oettinger, when you point to Mr Sarkozy as the great champion in the struggle for worldwide nuclear safety. I would be a little more circumspect if I were you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown. Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically. This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power. That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price. For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance. Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States. The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty. Billions in taxpayers’ money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it would be a serious mistake to turn this debate into a kind of trial against the risks of modernity. We must acknowledge that science and technology allow us to live longer, to live under better conditions, to live with a more confident outlook and taking into account that food security conditions have improved, that the conditions of our welfare systems have improved, that conditions in our forward-looking world have improved, precisely because it has been able to use and exploit science and technology.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course this viewpoint is not without risks, but these risks can be overcome if we are able to join forces to deal with the problems faced by the international community day by day. Mr Brock, in particular, got it right when he said that there is a mystery in our relationship with things that makes us realise that we have not mastered everything, that however advanced we may be, we have not got the answer to all problems that nature poses to humans and the magnitude of this earthquake reminds us of exactly that. It is very likely that inferior technology and science led not long ago or a hundred years ago, for example in Messina, to an event that caused more than 100 000 deaths, despite a much lower intensity earthquake.</p>
      <p sl="it">This should give us a clear guideline for the future: science and technology are tools and it takes good policy to put them to the fullest use. It will therefore take good politics, what we make together as institutions, to determine whether we currently have solutions to go beyond today's atomic age into the future or whether we must carry on taking these tools into account in the long term to enable the further development we all need.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, however, we are called on to do something quite different, essentially to take action to help with the pain and the need of a people.

You did, indeed, get off to a flying start last week, but since then you seem to have gone downhill. However, you really need to tackle this now and clarify your position, because what you said last week was that we should have a debate on Europe and on a future for Europe without nuclear energy. You have not repeated that since then, although that should be the subject of our debate now.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the events in Japan have affected all of us very profoundly. We pay tribute to the people who – at the risk of their lives – are dealing with the effects of three events which occurred together – the earthquake, the tsunami and the incident at the nuclear power plant. This tragedy has evoked great sympathy, and in so doing has also started the discussion we are currently witnessing in Europe on the future of nuclear energy and Europe’s energy strategy. We recently adopted an energy strategy for Europe up to 2020. At the moment it is, in a way, being undermined, although in the strategy we do accept nuclear energy. We say there that it should simply be accompanied by stringent safety conditions. However, it is an acceptable part of the energy mix of a number of countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems to me that this discussion should also enhance European cooperation on energy – and this is something we have asked for in our report. Today we not only have to improve safety conditions, we also have to strengthen the European Atomic Energy Community and move towards a European Energy Community. The European Commission must press for better cooperation between Member States and for Europeanisation of nuclear policy. Stress tests should not be voluntary – some countries will use them if they want to, while others will not. This must be part of building what is, after all, to be a common policy on nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also support new technologies. Europe’s entire energy strategy is based on decentralisation and diversification. Since this is the case, we should think about promoting small and medium-sized nuclear reactors. They cost less, are built as modules and as a result can be tested more easily in terms of safety. Perhaps this form will be more acceptable to public opinion, because we will not be able to eliminate this type of energy completely.</p>

The disaster in Japan is forcing us to fundamentally reconsider the issue of nuclear safety. We cannot control natural cataclysms, so we should at least ensure that natural disasters do not cause additional and particularly painful nuclear disasters.

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, if we are serious about our climate targets, then nuclear energy will remain part of our energy mix. That is why our discussions must not be ideological. What we need, first of all, are answers to numerous questions, such as what was the main reason for the accident and how could it have been prevented? Did the responsibility, implementation and supervision systems collapse? Was the safety culture in one of the nuclear plants weak? What are the options for storing spent nuclear fuel more safely? Was the regulatory authority too weak to take timely action?, and so forth. We need answers to these questions, and then we will be able to take responsible political action.</p>
      <p sl="sl">What does taking responsible political action actually mean? We need to reach a social agreement on acceptable technologies, in particular on the role of nuclear power plants. We need to ensure the ‘safety first’ principle is implemented. We need to formulate a legislative framework, which would provide adequate financial and human resources for the safe operation of complex technologies. We need to facilitate the development of an excellent and independent nuclear profession, its continued training and the transfer of knowledge from older to younger generations. We need to assess the competence and independence of regulatory bodies which play a key role in ensuring the culture of safety, and we need to ensure safe disposal of highly radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Finally, I would like to mention the common safety criteria. Today, we all agree that we really need them, but remember 2009, when we discussed the nuclear safety directive. Even back then the European Parliament affirmed the common European criteria which the Council unfortunately did not affirm. At the time, the European Parliament proved it was taking the right action. Therefore, I think that it is high time that the European Parliament was given more powers in the field of nuclear energy and we ought to reach an inter-institutional agreement so that we can have codecision powers.</p>

The disaster-stricken country has asked for the European Union’s help in the preliminary coordination of the aid offered by Member States.</p>

At the same time, however, I would like to voice the opinion that it is not fortunate to contrast this type of tragedy and similar tragedies with the use of nuclear power.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Oettinger for taking such a serious-minded and responsible approach to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should consider whether the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) should be upgraded to the position of European regulator for the 27 Member States. We should think about whether the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be made legally binding and whether this new regulator should be given the power to order an immediate shutdown if standards are not met. We should also consider reforming the Euratom Treaties, focusing on the safety and security regulations, as well as the issue of the coverage of the costs for decommissioning and final storage, which needs to be sorted out now.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe this to be a sensitive subject. We must take this opportunity here in Europe to implement a peer review and to institute the latest standards so that the health of the population is not put at further risk.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course I welcome the speedy assistance that we have given to the Japanese in their time of need, and I welcome and share the sympathy expressed with the Japanese. However, I cannot help but think that the sincerity of our comments on solidarity will be a little bit tempered by the action of some of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Reading our newspapers, I see that the Spanish Government has urged that goods from Japan be checked carefully for radiation; that the Netherlands Government has cautioned dock workers to handle all containers from Japan with care; that the French Government has called for the checking of all imports; and that the German authorities are demanding random checks on all goods imported from Japan including cars. These are goods which left Japan two or three weeks – and in some cases two or three months – before the earthquake.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is little expression of solidarity and sympathy in such action, and I would ask the Council and the Commission to try and speak to the Member States to say that, if they really want to express solidarity, they should not put out such scaremongering stories.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the call for stress tests but they do not answer the bigger questions. The question is: do we want to accept the rising risks of nuclear power in a world where complex natural disasters and extreme weather events are very much on the increase? The safety of nuclear reactors simply cannot be fully guaranteed in the event of a large-scale disaster of any description where there are multiple levels of disruption, where you get cuts to electricity, to water supply, to communications and to physical access. That is the question: do we actually want to take this risk when we have other alternatives?</p>

      <p sl="pt">We know that this disaster has triggered serious accidents in the Fukushima nuclear plant, the consequences of which still cannot be fully assessed. The accidents in this plant’s reactors resulted from the combination of highly improbable factors, it is true; however, they did combine and potentially it could happen again in other nuclear plants.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must therefore learn important lessons from what is happening in Fukushima. There is an immediate need to review and, if necessary, adapt the redundancies in terms of the plants’ safety systems, particularly with regard to the cooling systems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is necessary to reassess the locations of existing nuclear plants, particularly according to the risk of earthquakes and the risk that a tsunami will occur. However, there is also a need to undertake a broad discussion as a society about the energy issue, our present and future needs, and how these can be met, tackling in a lucid and informed way the risks, impacts, potential and limitations of the various sources of energy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to express my solidarity with the Japanese people who have been so hard hit by the catastrophe. It was a surprise to find that Japanese technology had not kept pace with events that constantly recur in those areas. Having kept a technologically obsolete nuclear power plant in operation is certainly not a matter of minor importance and these things should make us reflect on the European nuclear energy programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot allow ourselves to fall prey to fear and make hasty choices today: we need a general agreement on making existing nuclear plants safe and screening those that are under construction. Europe can not refrain from helping the Japanese people, not only due to the emergency, but also due to the probable financial crisis linked to the terrible catastrophic event.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the short run, steps must be taken to deal with an economic slowdown in Tokyo and with the likely consequences for the countries most closely linked to Japan. We should not forget that the government was already weak before the disaster and without a majority in the Upper House, meaning a crisis of the executive could be in the offing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my sympathies to all those affected by this devastating situation. The tragic accident in Japan has led to a nuclear disaster that is now familiar to us all. Europe has reacted in a relatively swift and united manner, although there is an awareness, which is hopefully shared by all those who support nuclear technology, that radioactivity knows no national borders and that nature does not recognise safety standards, however high they may be set. We have witnessed Chernobyl – a failed so-called stress test – and now we have Fukushima. The time has come for those who favour nuclear power to place the wellbeing and health of human beings and the natural environment above all financial interests. We should consider a Europe-wide phase-out and promote renewable energies.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the tsunami after the earthquake in Japan was the direct cause of the accident at the nuclear power plant, which became above all a question of safety for both the profession and the public. This is why the correct decision was made to subject our functioning nuclear power plants to rigorous testing. It has become clear that we need a comprehensive, thorough debate in order to reach a rational decision concerning the future of nuclear energy. We must also be aware that, after a terrible tragedy of this nature, people will become more afraid, and this is precisely why we must make sure that objective and genuine information is given and safety measures are tightened.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, I would like to emphasise that nuclear power plants in Europe are subject to entirely different environmental factors than those in Japan. Europe is not threatened by the danger of either tsunamis or such a powerful earthquake, hence direct conclusions should not be drawn from this unfortunate tragedy. Our facilities are prepared for the potential impacts on them, and nuclear energy can remain an integral part of our energy resources in the future as well. Finally, I would like to express my sympathy and esteem for our Japanese friends. Thank you.</p>

    <intervention id="3-168-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günther Oettinger" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened attentively to your contributions and would like to thank you for the objectivity you have displayed, both in relation to the disaster and its consequences. We have heard expressions of solidarity and sympathy, as well as offers of help. There is nothing further to add to that. This encourages us in the work to be done by the Council Presidency and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">The general issue at stake here is disaster response. If we consider Haiti and Pakistan and the host of other recent natural disasters, then I believe that the Commission’s communication on an improved European disaster response, which was approved by the Council in December of last year, points the way ahead. We need to improve cooperation within the framework of disaster response procedures at a European level and must dedicate appropriate financial and human resources to this, as well as coordinating efforts at European level. I have no doubt that Mrs Georgieva will bring some concrete proposals to Parliament and the Council during the course of the year.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to energy policy in Europe and the lessons to be drawn from the new information arriving from Japan, I believe that we need to start by taking an honest look at the facts and realities. Let me take the example of the German Government and its coalition parties, reminding you that I am a member of one of these parties. Our government has announced a significant change of direction. Seven nuclear power stations have currently been taken offline in Germany. This action has been criticised for ‘not showing much credibility’ or for being a ‘typical display of German angst’. I believe we need to remember that respect for different positions should be the starting point for deliberations. I wish to express my respect for Parliament, which a few years ago gave its clear backing to the permanent use of nuclear power in the European energy mix, but which has doubtless begun to reconsider this position . Secondly, I wish to express my respect for the EU’s regulatory powers. I have re-read the Euratom Treaty very carefully and have also looked closely at the Nuclear Safety Directive adopted by the Council and Parliament in June two years ago. The second document makes many formal recommendations about the authorities to be established, information and reporting obligations and other points, but offers hardly any specific, material recommendations for construction or operating techniques, or even the most general specifications.</p>
      <p sl="de">If Parliament proposes extending European legislation today, I am quite prepared not to wait for the reports from the Member States in 2014 before submitting a report to the Commission, but to insist that this Directive should become national law by July of this year at the latest – this would be incumbent upon the Member States – so that it will be possible, as further information is gathered from Japan and from the comprehensive stress tests, to discuss a proposal from the Commission for further specific, material requirements for nuclear safety here in Brussels over the next year rather than later.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has been said that I need to ‘act decisively’. I would disagree, however. I will take a consistent approach to this issue in asking what competences European legislators have and have not given me. When, even in the current climate, I hear criticism from some national governments for an over-dramatic assessment of the situation and the lessons to be learned from it, while others say it is high time I took decisive action, then I prefer to take a middle course. I have always felt comfortable on the middle ground. When you are criticised by both sides, then perhaps you are actually getting things right.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many of Europe’s 143 nuclear power stations will still be online in ten years’ time and, unless present governments have a change of heart, many, though not all, will still be operating in the following decade too. Consequently, it is in all our interests to insist on the highest safety levels, new standards and a further reduction of risks for those nuclear power stations remaining in operation in the medium to long term.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I assume that new nuclear power plants will be built in Europe under the aegis of the Member States, their national parliaments and governments. If we consider the referendum to be held in Italy in June, then we can see what is coming down the line and I note that with the exception of Germany, none of the thirteen Member States who operate nuclear power plants have changed their policy on this issue. I have been closely monitoring the debates at national governmental and parliamentary level and in the media</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to understand that, although this is a European issue, there is also a global dimension. It is in all our interests to ensure that the highest standards apply not only in our own territories, but also throughout the world, as, after all, nuclear power will be in use around the world for decades to come. It is for this reason that I welcome …</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Turmes, I really am trying hard to remain calm and objective here. I suggest you do the same. When you tell me not to trust Mr Sarkozy, I can only say that I have every confidence that he will table this point for discussion at the G-20 summit. This is a major success in itself: the issue will be discussed in a forum attended by the Americans, the Chinese, the Russians and others who already operate nuclear power plants, are planning to build new plants or have authorised major industrial concerns to build nuclear power plants in their countries. That is why I believe that the reassessment of risks and higher safety standards are essential, irrespective of whether one is for or against nuclear energy, because nuclear power is going to remain part of our global future.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">This is not the time to go back over the ground covered in the debates of two years ago. I am not the right person to deal with on that score. You are welcome to make your views known when others come to speak. I do not believe that you are addressing this issue to the right office holder.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me turn to the question of the Energy Roadmap 2050 and the criticism we have heard that this does not sufficiently promote and fund renewable energy sources. In this case you are underestimating the power of your own resolutions, although we seek to monitor and guarantee compliance with such decisions. 20% renewable energy sources in just nine years actually corresponds to 35% in the crucial area of electricity generation, which is where these sustainable sources are primarily deployed. We are well on the way to generating 35% of electricity from renewable energy sources – and the Member States are playing their part – while renewable energy sources are set to overtake nuclear power and coal in electricity generation in four to five years. This means that we are on the way to making renewable energy sources the most important sources for electricity in Europe. We will present our concepts and scenarios for the Energy Roadmap 2050 in late spring. However, there are other significant dates besides 2050, which might seem far off – there are also interim targets for 2025 and 2030, in other words for the period that requires investment in infrastructure and production capacities right now. I do not want to make concrete commitments here at this point, but by 2030 we will certainly have gone beyond 35% renewable energy sources, reaching a figure of over 40%, or even 60%, or somewhere in between. If this does prove to be the case, then nobody will be able to argue that renewable energy sources did not receive sufficient backing; renewable energy sources will play a decisive part in the energy mix within our lifetime.</p>
      <a text="(Interruption by Mrs Harms)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Harms, I am talking about the Energy Roadmap, while you are referring to the CO2 Roadmap. These are two different issues. We have not lowered the targets for 2020. They are unchanged – a 20% standalone target and 30% if other countries follow suit. This has always been the position of Parliament, the Council and the Commission and this is the global offer on the table. There have been no changes. What we are talking about here is ‘renewable energy sources’ and that is where we shall achieve over 40%. We have therefore created a basis for ensuring that the energy mix is no longer just a matter for the Member States, but that the Member States share 50% of the responsibility, or a little more. Secondly, we have also set down requirements for establishing subsidy principles and for how the financial and technical resources are to be set up in the Member States with our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">You can rest assured, Mr Turmes, that the scenarios will seriously examine something that has been proposed by various bodies, namely a move to up to 100% renewable energy sources. However, then you need to take a look at the legislation, specifically Article 194, which states that the energy mix is a matter for the Member States. I do not regard the Treaty of Lisbon as set in stone. It does, however, provide the parameters for my activities, setting down the rights of the Member States. These rights are jealously guarded, whether in Berlin, Luxembourg, Paris or London.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one final point to make. I listened very carefully to what Mr Davies and Mr Hall had to say. They both belong to the same party. They both come from the same Member State. Yet, as we have heard, they have diametrically opposed positions. I respect that. When a small party in a large country can accommodate such divergent opinion as expressed by these two honourable Members and when the same party was opposed to nuclear energy in its country before the election but can accept it now that the election has taken place, then I respect this nonetheless. However, this goes to show the ecological, economic and political dimension of this issue, which is why we shall always have disagreement. Part of the process is always global in nature.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I promise that I will be brief. Sympathy and a cool head are, I believe, the two things which should guide our actions now. Through sympathy we can help the Japanese with all they need; we can listen to them and take action where they, too, see a need, and a cool head is required in order to make the right decisions in good time about our own future. We should not decide on an issue of such importance under the influence of events. One thing that is certain, and no one in this Chamber has disputed this today, is that we must strive to achieve maximum safety with all our strength.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is our duty, moreover, to fully inform citizens in order that they understand what is under discussion, and when, about what and how we decide. It is very important that we draw conclusions and learn lessons. We should examine the events without being either tardy or jumping the gun and making statements which in a couple of weeks’ or months’ time may not stand their ground. As regards stress tests, I would simply point out that now, based on the current regulation, there is a voluntary option for these. Several of you have mentioned amending the legal bases, the frameworks which are in force today, which I firmly believe that the European Council would not exclude. This needs to be elaborated and an appropriate proposal tabled. There is no need to hurry but naturally the work must start.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Commissioner Oettinger also pointed out that the energy mix is a national competence. Every Member State makes a sovereign decision about which forms of energy it uses to cover its energy needs. Half the Member States, half in terms of scale, use nuclear energy. When we have the appropriate legal basis, we will be able to impose a safety obligation on anyone, but the option and responsibility to choose lies with the Member States. In any event I welcome with pleasure that the Commission, as Commissioner Oettinger mentioned, will be able to prepare the report by July 2011. As a final thought, we talk a lot about research and development, which is also a cornerstone of the Europe 2020 Strategy. It is our task to create the best possible conditions for research and development in the European Union. Indeed, we still have much to do in this area. With the aid of research and development we should find the safest possible and most environmentally friendly forms of energy production. Let us make science serve people and the maximum safety of people. Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First of all, permit me to express my profound condolences to the Japanese people and the relatives of the victims in connection with the exceptional natural and industrial disaster which happened barely 12 days ago. The Japanese tragedy reminds us that natural and industrial disasters can occur anywhere at any time, even in Europe, too. The question is merely when and where they will happen. This is precisely why I believe it is important for the European Union, in the event of a potential industrial disaster in Europe, to have at its disposal an adequate financial facility to intervene immediately and effectively, and to alleviate damages. Naturally, the EU efforts aimed at prevention are very important, but at present the European Union does not have a financial facility that can satisfy the aforementioned need. We only have to imagine what would happen if a disaster struck a Member State in a difficult financial situation. Apart from the shocking social and environmental consequences, this would gravely affect the budget of such a country and the European economy as well. In my view for this reason Europe needs a new disaster insurance scheme which, based on the principle of mandatory liability insurance, would provide additional funds in the region of EUR 4 to 5 billion per annum from payments by potential polluters in order to extend swift financial aid in the event of industrial disasters. Furthermore, the payers may also be the beneficiaries of the scheme as a result of the support they could claim through tendering for safety and environmental protection investments from the unused funds.</p>

      <p sl="it">The growing demand for energy requires diversification in the supply of alternative energy sources to oil, such as renewable solar, wind and nuclear energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, the production of energy from nuclear sources is not an argument that should be discussed with feelings running as high as they are at present. I am afraid, in fact, that the usual opponents of nuclear power, often financed by oil companies, will try to exploit events in Japan to promote Italy's energy dependence on oil and its by-products. More than 8 000 people in Italy and more than 350 000 in Europe die each year because of pollution caused by burning oil by-products.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, as regards the identification of possible sites in the area, I stress that this choice is aided by technical and scientific guidelines produced by experts that will put administrators in a position to make the most appropriate choices to ensure public safety and environmental sustainability. I hope that discussions about alternative energy sources to oil can be addressed with objectivity, ensuring European citizens adequate and accurate information in order to prevent easy manipulation, making us even more dependent on unstable oil-producing countries.</p>

The EU must support Japan with all the capacity it can muster in launching and running the reconstruction programmes. I have closely followed the debate, but I must say that I cannot agree with turning such a tragedy into a crusade against nuclear energy. This is a cheap, green source of energy and technological progress will make it increasingly safe. A plane crash, for example, is similarly tragic, but I do not believe that this provides sufficient reason for us to have doubts about the benefit and safety of planes. The correct solution is: yes to stress tests, yes to supervision and no to demonising nuclear energy.</p>

The European Union will continue with any kind of assistance that the Japanese government regards appropriate to help them get through this terrible crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the nuclear power plant alerts in Fukushima have provoked an emotional debate over the use of nuclear energy in the European Union in general. I would advise everyone to consider their positions dispassionately and keep in mind that the use of automobiles was not forbidden when an Irish scientist, Mary Ward, was thrown out of, and run over by, her cousin’s steam car on 31 August 1869.</p>

      <p sl="en">First and foremost, I would like to join all those who have expressed sympathy for the people of Japan, stricken by the destructive earthquake and the tsunami. This natural disaster has taken the lives of thousands of people, which is an appalling loss. It has deprived further tens of thousands of their homes, personal items and belongings, dramatically changing their lives for years to come. We must not forget this, even though the media are concentrating instead on the nuclear energy issues. The problems of the damaged Fukushima plant almost overshadow everything else. However, I would like to say – in connection with the alarmist scenarios – that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki still constitute the greatest ever nuclear catastrophe. The greatest threat to humanity is the military nuclear arsenal. It is expanding, despite the many good intentions, and it lacks the permanent and thorough public control that we see with nuclear power plants. Moreover, after the events in Japan, safety requirements and standards will surely be further enhanced. We must therefore stick to a sensible position, avoiding any hasty or even hysterical reactions to the events in Japan. There is currently no alternative to nuclear energy, which provides us with much-needed, accessible and emission-free power. I am pleased that the Czech Republic, Finland, France and others are taking a realistic approach to the issue.

Humanitarian aid for Japan is an obvious and necessary reaction of the European Union in response to the tragic catastrophe which has hit the country. I think Japan and the affected regions should be given all necessary aid (technical, administrative and organisational) as well as financial support. Besides emergency aid, we should also consider developing a model of systematic cooperation with all countries which are at risk from various types of disaster, including countries which are not part of the European Union. I would like to ask the services of the Commission and the Council which are responsible for this area to review the relevant legislation and make proposals for enhancing exchange of effective practices in the field of crisis management.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Increasing numbers of countries, including those of the European Union, are suffering more and more often as a result of natural disasters. Therefore it is essential to have permanent and highly developed international cooperation. It is also important to conduct a review of existing legal and regulatory frameworks for the safety and protection of nuclear installations.

They must be located and designed on the basis of criteria every bit as extreme as the natural phenomena to which they may be exposed. Scientists estimate, with a high degree of probability, that strong earthquakes may well occur in the medium and long term. Politicians should not therefore, under any circumstances, plan nuclear plants in active earthquake zones.

      <p sl="lt">Firstly, I would like to offer the Japanese people my sympathy following the earthquake and tsunami that have struck the country and claimed many lives. Given the tragic disaster at Fukushima nuclear power plant that followed the earthquake and tsunami, I would call on Europe to consider the future of nuclear energy and look for other alternative means of producing energy. Furthermore, our assessments of the impact of the disaster must be based on information and expertise provided by specialists and experts, and we must view new means of producing electricity from a scientific perspective. The events in Japan should be a worry for all Member States, regardless of whether or not their countries have nuclear power plants, because if similar disasters occurred, radiation would threaten the whole of Europe. At present Russian and Belarusian intentions to build nuclear power plants are a major cause for concern for the countries of Eastern Europe, in particular the Baltic States. The impact of radiation from these planned nuclear power plants is an even greater worry and there is concern about neighbouring countries complying with international safety requirements. I would like to stress that immediately after the disaster in Japan, Germany shut down its own reactors built before 1980. The Member of the European Commission responsible for Energy also maintains that Europe should strive for a future without nuclear power plants. Therefore, once we have assessed the potential radiation threat to Europe, here in the European Parliament we should discuss the risk of nuclear power plants near the European Union’s external borders.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The devastating earthquake and tsunami which struck Japan and the Pacific region on 11 March 2011, taking a toll of thousands of innocent lives, was a tragedy which has moved us all. It is our duty to convey expressions of profound solidarity with the Japanese people and government and to offer our condolences, and it is also our duty to extend humanitarian, technical and financial aid. I am pleased that the European Union provided this essential support almost immediately, using its best rescue teams and its experience in the field of disaster mitigation. This aid must be given continuously until the situation in Japan stabilises. In view of the disturbing fact that the disaster caused an extremely serious nuclear accident, which is affecting the Fukushima nuclear power station and constitutes a fresh threat to life and health, we should review and test the safety of nuclear power plants within the EU. Despite the fact that the accident at the Fukushima power station is a warning to us, I do not think it should cause us to panic or be prejudiced against nuclear energy. Japan has very often helped European nations in mitigating the effects of disasters, using its extensive and valuable experience in this area. The time has come when we have to take up this important role. I am certain that such cooperation will not only bring benefits in the form of emergency aid for the victims, but will also strengthen our relations with such an important friend as Japan.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The catastrophic earthquake which struck Japan is a very powerful demonstration that no country, not even one with a highly developed economy, can cope on its own with the scale of the tragic effects caused by such an enormous disaster. Alongside the expressions of sympathy which we all extend today to the people of Japan, it is our duty to provide aid to the victims of the disaster. An event as unpredictable as an earthquake, which alongside the tragedy of its many thousands of victims has also resulted in a major threat of a nuclear catastrophe, demands that we learn its lessons, despite the fact that we are not directly affected by this disaster. We must give a sincere answer to the question as to how well prepared European nuclear power plants are for incidents of this kind. Therefore, in order to avoid potential threats in the future – because even though they are unlikely they are, however, possible – and to ensure the safety of the people of Europe, it is essential to verify the safety features which are in place in nuclear power plants in the Union’s Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">We should not only focus on nuclear safety within the EU, but also look at its immediate neighbourhood. Two new projects for nuclear power plants with experimental reactors are being developed on the edges of the EU: one in Kaliningrad and another located in Belarus, 23 km from the EU’s external border and 50 km from Lithuania’s capital city.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both sites were selected on unknown criteria. The lack of transparency in the process, flawed consultations and failure to share information with the affected countries make both projects a cause for serious concern. Work has already started, although the international environmental impact assessments of both plants are far from complete.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, immediately after the tragedy in Japan, Russia and Belarus signed an agreement giving a green light to build the plant in Belarus. Data from the Chernobyl and Fukushima tragedies show that the area of immediate radioactive impact is 50-55 km. In the event of an accident, the capital of an EU Member State would be immediately affected. The EU should demand that these third countries take their responsibilities seriously and carefully observe international obligations and standards for nuclear energy. I hope the upcoming European Council will agree to take the appropriate decisions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, refugees are probably the most vulnerable populations in the world and, of them, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable are those who can neither return home nor stay in the countries of transit. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees puts a figure on that population: 200 000 refugees per year. We know that half this number are resettled by the United States and other players, and we know that Europe does too little: 4 500 per year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We all agree, therefore, that the tragedy of the refugees is urgent and important. How important is it? The Council itself has already answered this question. The Swedish Presidency talked about resettling 100 000 per year and the Belgian Presidency, at the end of its own term said – we had Prime Minister Yves Leterme here –that refugees were the image of the European Union’s very raison d’être . Excuse me for saying so, but refugees are important for the Hungarian Presidency for historical reasons because it was for Hungary, in 1956, that the first concerted effort was made by the international community to resettle thousands of refugees.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the end, however, how urgent is the tragedy of the refugees? Unfortunately, it is this question that we are forced to ask the Council. How much of a priority are refugees for the Council? Are they urgent enough to finally put a signature, to finally add a signature to a piece of paper? A year ago, Parliament voted in favour of two reports, one of which was a co-decision on the European Refugee Fund. The vast majority of us united behind what was important: from the Greek Communists to the British Conservatives. We did our homework. A year later we are still waiting for the Council. The co-decision process has transformed into a co-indecision process. This co-indecision process would be ridiculous if it were not so tragic for the people on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report that we adopted included emergency measures to be applied in addition to the Commission’s annual priorities. We did this because we know that a humanitarian crisis can erupt at any time. One has just erupted in North Africa, on our doorstep, and we do not have these emergency measures ready to be implemented. We do not have them because the Council has unfortunately not finished this co-decision.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, from the first day that it was completed, we would have, in addition to these emergency procedures, extra money for countries wishing to start carrying out resettlement, and clear categories for priorities to be used by the Member States. We would also have everything that we put into the own-initiative report: quality, speed and the creation of a resettlement unit in the European Asylum Support Office.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Members of the Council, you – I am finishing here, Mr President – are co-legislators. It is not for us to tell the Council how to legislate, but this desk-drawer veto helps no one, especially the institutions’ credibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the resettlement programme is something that we worked extremely intensively on, investing a lot of energy, across all group divides and allegiances. We were unanimous in wanting to send out a clear signal on this matter. We also made it our top priority simply because it is such an important issue: people’s lives are at stake.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, the situation and ongoing developments in North Africa mean that we are called on once again to produce results in double-quick time. We have already lost one year. We have made the best use of the time available to provoke a civil and social debate because, in the final analysis, we also need the support of the Member States, regional authorities and the local population if such a programme is to become established in the new Member States, too. This discussion and the social consensus that has gradually resulted cannot be abandoned just because the Council and other key players are unable to agree and have reached an impasse. The issue is too important. We have instigated this debate and, true to our liberal credentials, our aim is to make this matter a genuine priority.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we have agreement across all the groups in Parliament. We have signalled our position and now await a clear course to be set by the Council so that the issue will be placed on the agenda and that the other Member States that have so far not played an active role will now be encouraged to get involved. The feedback that we have received during our discussions indicates that these Member States are willing to come on board. For this reason, the main concern on the part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – although I believe I can speak for all the groups involved because the level of cooperation was really excellent – is that this matter should be given priority and the debate that we have engendered on a broad social level should be encouraged, rather than jeopardised by continuously the matter being continuously put on the long finger.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, following on from what my fellow members said, I too should like to add that, first of all, Minister, almost a year after the resolutions passed by this Parliament, in which a great deal of effort was invested, a mission was sent to Syria for that very reason and we tried to galvanise as many Member States as possible into becoming involved in the refugee resettlement programme; yet, despite all that, we have still done nothing. Even if there are formal problems on the part of the Council and Parliament also needs to be involved, we are here to find solutions. That is our purpose.</p>
      <p sl="el">We refer to the humanitarian dimension of this programme, but we also refer to the instrument provided to Europe, so that it can exercise its foreign policy even more effectively. Would this instrument not be a very important tool today in Baroness Ashton’s hands, if she were in North Africa and could refer to the programme we had decided on?</p>
      <p sl="el">Obviously we refer to global needs. However, we do need, of course, to understand that the problem now lies at our door. Europe is being called upon to play a leading role in the Mediterranean. We need to start up this programme, Minister, and push ahead with it and we need to understand, when debating budgetary resources post-2013, that there are resources for this programme up to 2013 and, if we waste any more time, we shall no longer be able to utilise those resources and facilities.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, may I remind you, Minister, of the proposal we made back then and to which we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) keep reverting, namely the refugee reallocation programme. We cannot afford to wait for yet another Lampedusa, Minister, before we understand how necessary this initiative is and that we need to push full steam ahead with it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, honourable Members, the European Parliament addressed three questions related to the resettlement of refugees to the European Council. I would like to thank the three questioners very much for presenting in detail the considerations which led them to formulating the questions. All three questions were related to the Commission’s proposal which intends to amend the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 with regard to the establishment of a joint European Union resettlement programme. I believe that this debate also demonstrates the deep concern of the European Parliament for the fate of people who are most in need. Therefore, first, I would like to thank the honourable Members for paying such very close attention to resolving the situation of the refugees. As Mr Tavares remarked as well, coming from Hungary, with its inheritance of the 1956 revolution and as a commitment to that, the Hungarian Presidency has a moral obligation to achieve progress in the area of the joint European Union resettlement programme.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The North African crisis, which several of you have referred to, has shown the need to establish a well-functioning, unified European asylum system. I agree with the European Parliament’s position that the European Union must accept responsibility in resolving the situation of refugees if it wishes to preserve its leading role in the provision of humanitarian aid. Allow to me to give you the very latest information on how the refugee situation on the borders of Libya is developing at this moment. I visited the Tunisian-Libyan border at the beginning of March. At that time one thousand refugees were arriving every hour, most of them migrant workers for whom finding a way home, a means of repatriation, was the most burning issue. Of them all, the people in the most difficult situation were those who arrived without any papers or documents at all. The international aid organisations on the spot were looking after them. Their number was growing; their repatriation, as such, is irresolvable, and therefore in this instance the resettlement system certainly comes into consideration. Today, or rather yesterday and today, the Hungarian Foreign Minister János Martonyi has been on the other side, on the Libyan-Egyptian border. The primary purpose of his visit was to learn about the refugee situation. He went to the border and met Egyptian officials there. The situation there, on this section, has changed now. For three days there has been no outflow from Libya on that section of the border.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At present, there are about 200 people who should be able to take part in the resettlement programme. The others who have arrived until now are being evacuated, that is to say assisted in returning home, by the Egyptian authorities, incidentally with the help of EU Member States. By the way, Mr Martonyi has also held talks with the Foreign Minister of the Benghazi Transitional National Council, as well as the Egyptian Interior Minister precisely to gain an overview of the refugee situation. As regards a common European asylum policy, I would like to emphasise that we will do our utmost in order to create a common policy and system which is based on the full application of the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention relating to the status of refugees and other relevant international conventions, and is in accordance with the commitments undertaken in the Stockholm Programme by the European Council. The Hungarian Presidency is committed to advancing the proposals in the refugee package. This is also shown by the fact that, based on last week’s authorisation granted by the Member States, we are ready to start informal trialogues on the Asylum Qualification Directive as soon as possible in order to achieve the target date of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I thank you once again for the January debate which I presided over on this subject. Then, too, I replied to MEPs’ questions. I would also like to stress that the Council, as it acknowledges the importance of resettlement as a lasting solution for refugees, welcomed the proposal for a decision on establishing a joint EU resettlement programme and the related Commission announcement, which the Commission submitted back in September 2009. These initiatives stemmed from the agreement which the European Council reached in connection with the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum in September 2008, namely, that the resettlement of persons under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the territory of the European Union could proceed for the time being on a voluntary basis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As a concrete example, I would highlight the conclusions of the Council in July and November 2008 in which the EU Member States made a commitment to resettle Iraqi refugees in their territory or rather this is what we encouraged them to do in these conclusions. In September 2009, the Council started the detailed examination of the proposal to amend the decision on establishing the European Refugee Fund. In the first half of 2010, informal meetings were held with the European Parliament on several occasions. The Member States, showing great flexibility, adopted the European Parliament’s proposals almost in their entirety in order to achieve the common objective, the establishment of a better, more flexible system in accordance with the Commission’s proposal. As the honourable Members rightly pointed out in their questions, the European Council and the European Parliament reached agreement on the political content of the decision as a result of the aforementioned informal meetings. The Council supported, for example, one of Parliament’s most important proposals, namely that a mechanism be created which would encourage newer Member States to join the resettlement programme through financial instruments among other things. The Council, however, could not support the proposal of the European Parliament which suggested that the adoption of the common EU annual resettlement priorities happen in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty through the application of the procedure relating to delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The position of the Council and the Commission is identical on this. The programming cycle for the operation of the General Programme on Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows sets tight deadlines, and effective planning can be provided through implementing acts. Furthermore, the Council agreed with the Commission’s opinion that defining annual resettlement priorities has only an implementing nature because essentially this means that the detailed rules in the decision are applied to specific situations. It is regrettable that the Council and the European Parliament were not able to agree in relation to the proposal at a level that would allow the common EU resettlement priorities to be defined for each year.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, we should not forget that resettlement is among the activities to be supported under the current European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013. It is true that, based on the proposed changes, the Member States taking part in the resettlement programme for the first time would receive somewhat greater financial support, and there would be an opportunity to define the geographic regions designated for resettlement and the nationalities in need of resettlement each year. Nonetheless, even now Member States are entitled to a fixed amount of EUR 4 000 for each person resettled who falls under one of the categories specified in the relevant decision. Apart from this, there is no obstacle to Member States which have not participated hereto starting resettlement activity under the current programme. It is a pleasure for me to inform you that Hungary, too, will become part of this programme next year and is prepared to participate in the resettlement programme.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Lastly, I would like to emphasise that naturally the Council remains willing to consider all proposals that can be implemented and offer a mutually acceptable solution to outstanding issues related to this matter. Our aim, in accordance with the Commission’s proposal, is to make the existing mechanism even more flexible and efficient. I would very much like this extremely important matter not to become the captive of yet another question of legal interpretation. There are a great many issues where very important matters are the captives of the ‘implementing act’ versus ‘delegated act’ dilemma, and I would like positive progress to be achieved in these during the Hungarian Presidency. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think nobody will be surprised to hear me say again that solidarity with refugees and displaced persons should constitute a fundamental element of EU policy in the areas of asylum and immigration.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it is not just a question of having solidarity with those coming from weak and disadvantaged societies, but also with the Member States that, because of their geographic location, their culture or their language, suffer greater pressure in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="es">While numbers of applications for protection and of immigrants arriving are low in some countries, there are many other countries that are unable to tackle on their own the pressure their borders are subjected to on a daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="es">Following Parliament’s adoption of the reports relating to the Commission communication on the Union resettlement programme and the modification of the European Refugee Fund in May 2010, we are still waiting for the Council to complete the codecision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="es">The pilot projects currently being undertaken in 10 Member States are a drop in an ocean, which we still have to cross.</p>
      <p sl="es">The southern Member States are subjected to great pressure, particularly since the popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia, and the war in Libya, began.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lampedusa, with a population of 5 000, has received almost 6 000 immigrants since the conflicts started.</p>
      <p sl="es">The aforementioned pilot projects are completely insufficient and will hardly do anything to relieve the pressure that is already affecting Italy and Malta, but will affect other Mediterranean countries in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Union as a whole must help these countries. It is imperative that the Council overcome the obstacles currently preventing the full implementation of a European resettlement programme and defeat the minorities blocking it. Massive population displacements and migrations affect the Union as a whole and not just a part of it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am finishing, Mr President. Last week I called for a European Parliament presence on Libya’s borders and I repeat that call now. It is not enough for 10 fellow Members to have spent last week in Egypt: we must have the capacity to evaluate the humanitarian situation ourselves.</p>

While we want to see improvements in the common asylum system, what we are asking for here is the removal of the barriers that make for a European resettlement system of very limited credibility, taking care of say 4000 refugees in the whole of the European Union, compared to the kind of figure that we see in the United States and Canada.

The lesson of North Africa is that all of those people are pouring into countries unable to deal with the burden.</p>

      <p sl="en">The UK, like other Member States, has played its part in resettling refugees through national resettlement programmes in the past, but it is hugely important that through a coordinated, cooperative and communicative approach we discuss how we can best reconcile assisting those most in need with the situations of those Member States that are already overburdened with national priorities. I am cautious, however, that programmes in this area should not undermine a nation’s right to set its own policies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, resettlement is an important instrument in dealing with refugees. Other countries such as the US resettle thousands of refugees on their territory every year. Resettlement is for people who have not reached, or have not tried to reach, the European Union to apply for asylum here, so for all the Heads of State who are constantly saying that we should tackle migration where it originates before it ends up in the European Union, this should be the perfect instrument.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, instead of the EU, it is countries that are much poorer than any of the EU Member States that take in and host great numbers of refugees, such as Pakistan and Syria. Since these countries lack reception facilities, many refugees have to endure unacceptable conditions. The EU can and should help here. The resettlement of Iraqi refugees in the EU has shown that it works. However, the number of Iraqi refugees accepted was ridiculously small.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many more internationally-recognised refugees need a fair chance for a new life, and I find it incredible that the Council and Commission try to prevent Parliament from exercising its parliamentary rights. I do not find it acceptable if you are saying that we are delaying the process: it was just us who are trying to implement our normal parliamentary rights. I think it is you, the Council, that is delaying it by means of not granting us these rights. This is not only our right, but also our duty as elected representatives of the European people.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to know your practical, precise timetable for overcoming the difficulties that you have encountered. Are you personally committing yourself to putting this issue on the agenda as soon as possible? We are losing time every day.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are other instruments that would be a great asset in the current situation. Resettlement could also play a role in the long run when we are tackling the situation in North Africa, but there are also other instruments we have in place which are not being used. For instance, the directive on temporary protection or the internal distribution of refugees. These are instruments that are in place but are being not used. That leaves me with the impression that Member States are not willing to protect human rights, that they are timid when it comes to international protection. I would like to know what how you are trying to put the common asylum system into place by 2012, because that seems to be rather late to me.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we are talking about migration these days, we obviously cannot help but begin by analysing the situation in North Africa. On the one hand, it is to be welcomed that the peoples of North Africa have felt the wind of democracy, but on the other hand, it is lamentable that masses are dying these days, and even in these very hours. Children, women, innocent civilians. This, I must add, is only the short-term effect. After all, it will be in the long term that migration will truly show its negative impact. Let us just consider the simple fact that nearly half a million people, refugees, have left Libya in the past few days. The resettlement of these refugees is made particularly difficult by the fact that Western Europe is full. In Eastern Europe, however, it is the prevalence and ethnic ratio of the Roma that makes the reception of additional immigrants hard. In Western Europe the same applies to people from Black Africa, or Arabs, for that matter.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let us, however, ask this question: what if we settle these immigrants in Europe? What will happen after that? Who will provide them with jobs? What about social tensions? What about religious, ethnic and cultural tensions? In the current situation it is absurd to settle more immigrants in Europe in such a forcible manner. And the reason this process, this liberal structure, has come to a halt is that this migration concept is fundamentally flawed. Would the liberal Members please contemplate how few of them are present in this hall, at the discussion of a topic that is so important to them? Why, there are one or two Members from the liberal group here. Shame on you! And do not even hope to achieve your goals if you participate at plenary sittings with such levels of activity. The European Refugee Fund should instead be used to create livelihoods for those people in North Africa and locally in the countries of the refugees, and give European people back their esteem and their work. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I was very pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council stressing the importance of refugees and the resettlement programme. The figures from the United Nations High Commission on Refugees are clear: we are talking about millions of refugees and about more than 200 000 people in need of resettlement programmes every year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is, therefore, a humanitarian emergency in the world around us: now it is not just in Afghanistan, Somalia and the Congo, but we are also facing it in Egypt, in Libya and in many other countries. However, as well as the humanitarian emergency there is, as Mr Papanikolaou reminded us, also the fact that we have unspent budgetary resources because these programmes have not been approved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is what is happening, Mrs Enikő. I was also pleased to hear you saying that this process would not be paralysed because of legal issues. However, the truth is that this process is paralysed, to a great extent for legal reasons. We are in a co-decision process and we have not seen the Council disagree with Parliament’s solutions. Mr Tavares prepared an excellent report and we see no proposals from the Council to contradict the model resettlement programme that has been designed. What we are seeing is the Council limited by legal issues, and that cannot happen. The question that Mr Tavares was asking at the start of this debate, of knowing what is the priority and if the issue of refugee resettlement is or is not important to the Presidency and the Council, is very important.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have the feeling that this, in fact, is not important. Members will be holding a Council tomorrow, after which – we already know this Council’s proposed conclusions – the draft on the issue of migratory flows is being put off until the July Council. The recommendation that we would like to be taken from here, Mrs Enikő, is that the European Parliament is not asking the Council to delay: the European Parliament is asking the Council to decide.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of the humanitarian crisis in Libya, today more than ever, it is fundamental that Europe provides itself with the means of concerted action in respect of resettlement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Whereas, since 1 March, UNHCR has called on the international community to participate in an urgent resettlement effort, no Member State has so far made known their intention to take part. Only Italy has welcomed 58 Eritreans urgently evacuated from Tripoli, but I hear it said that there is a programme or proposal to resettle 4 000 people trapped in Libya. Hence I would like to know more on this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is indeed the case that the European Union’s responsibility in this area cannot allow for inaction. We need to show increased solidarity with these countries and with their population. Tunisia and Egypt have agreed to open their borders to those fleeing Libya. Europe must support them and play its part in the international effort for protecting refugees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, beyond the urgency of the humanitarian crisis in Libya, the challenges that Europe has to face up to with regard to resettlement are many. I will mention three.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the European Union must work towards a more generous resettlement policy for those for whom resettlement is a last resort. In this respect, we should all have in mind that in 2009, approximately 85 000 refugees were resettled in the world, but only 8.4% were resettled in Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to this quantitative objective, any credible European resettlement policy should also ensure a high standard of preparation prior to candidates’ resettlement, by taking into consideration the most vulnerable and the quality of reception and integration facilities in the host country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, insofar as it complements the existing national asylum schemes, the European resettlement programme should, as Parliament’s position in 2010 already made clear, be based on the various experiences and results within the Member States and be subject to enhanced coordination.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, everywhere in the world, streams of refugees are on the move. This is partly the result of wars and unrest and partly that of natural disasters. These people are looking for temporary shelter. The vast majority of refugees go back to their homeland, but around 200 000 have to be resettled somewhere else in the world. Circumstances are changing constantly, however, and due to the unrest and wars in North Africa, Europe’s southern borders are now under increased pressure from thousands of refugees. The capacities of the Member States to take these people vary considerably.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this stream of refugees will mean in terms of what proportion can be included in the resettlement programme. This programme will extend the EU’s competence in the area of refugees and asylum. I view this as problematic. Like other Members asking questions, I too would like to ask whether the Council can give a time horizon for a response to the question of whether it is in favour of or against a joint EU resettlement programme.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem we are debating is clearly a public opinion problem.</p>
      <p sl="es">How do we convince the Member States that a common resettlement policy is better? That a Member State wishes to maintain its sovereignty in this area is not an obstacle to there being a Union policy that sets some priorities, nor does it prevent these policies being reflected in European Refugee Fund (ERF) grants.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore urgent to break the stalemate on this issue, as there are many possible solutions. Perhaps the Council should consider this issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">If the Member States can receive financing from the ERF without any conditions being attached, then there will never be a common resettlement policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the common asylum policy is an unresolved issue that cannot be hidden away. Moreover, not tackling a joint strategy is unintelligent and miserly, and its only result will be that the consequences of this lack of response become worse day by day.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not merely a question of values: it is that the lack of coordination and common solidarity is more costly for the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, almost one year ago I stated in this plenary that less than half of EU Member States had official resettlement programmes for refugees from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Moreover, these programmes are not well coordinated. As a result of the low level of coordination and cooperation between EU Member States, the costs connected with resettlement are disproportionately high. It is still true that, given sufficient political will, we will be capable of creating an effective, fair and unified resettlement programme. To this end, it will be essential to create not only a programme, but also a special fund for the resettlement of refugees in the Union. This package would finance the creation of national resettlement programmes where they do not exist already, as well as the coordination of activities at the central level.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Although we have long known these facts, and although political consensus has prevailed between Parliament, the Commission and the Council for at least a year, there has been no final decision. I would therefore like to join the call made by Members for the Council to include the completion of the co-decision process in this area among its priorities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we have serious concerns about the humanitarian situation of refugees, about those fleeing from wars, armed conflicts, hunger, exploitation, penury, and of the women and child victims of human trafficking. Solidarity with these people is a central issue requiring concrete measures, whether in terms of aid for refugees or in terms of supporting the countries that, because of their geographic proximity, are most highly sought by refugees..</p>
      <p sl="pt">The recent conflicts in the countries of North Africa, added to the wars in the Middle East, have worsened an already very difficult situation. Therefore it is necessary to have effective and urgent measures to resettle refugees and house them in the dignity they deserve. We cannot continue to wait for decisions that are dragging on whilst thousands of people are knocking at our gates daily, without raising the response to which they have a right.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Minister of State, we can see, as you too have said, that it was the events of the past few weeks that best demonstrated how the matter of refugees could become a serious, acute issue in Europe at any moment. It is also quite apparent that the EU is not prepared for states of emergency, larger waves of refugees, or to provide a strategic solution to the refugee situation. The matter of resettlement is one of our important tools in this regard. And naturally, a higher degree of solidarity and better coordination should be expected. However, as has been said here in this debate, this area requires social consensus. All of us, and the Member States, too, have a lot of work to do in this area. Nevertheless, we appreciate the fact that the Hungarian Presidency does not intend to set up legal barriers and is showing openness and commitment with regard to settling this issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, a small, elite, politically correct grouping obviously believes that we still do not have enough refugees in Europe and that the European Refugee Fund should be used to bring those who have already fled to a bordering third country into the EU because the standard of living is higher here. This approach seems particularly out of touch when one considers that hundreds of thousands of refugees from North Africa are already flooding into Europe and that the island of Lampedusa is already on the verge of exploding.</p>
      <p sl="de">A better option would be to accommodate refugees near their home countries in a cultural environment that is as familiar to them as possible, for example in Egypt and Tunisia, as this would avoid integration problems in Europe. Following the democratic changes, these two countries should be classified as safe third countries for refugees and that is where we should be channelling controllable, sustainable, structural aid.</p>

    <intervention id="3-199-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Enikő Győri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, honourable Members, I will also attempt to provide specific answers to the main subjects. First of all, let us have a look at the record of the European Union, in that many have said here that we have fallen behind the United States and other countries in terms of generosity. I do not think that it is so. The total number of refugees resettled by the EU is, on an annual basis, indeed lower than the corresponding numbers in the US, Canada or Australia. And although the Council fully acknowledges that resettlement continues to be a means of permanently resolving the situation of refugees, we should keep in mind that the annual number of spontaneous asylum requests submitted to the EU far exceeds that in other regions of the world. According to the statistics published by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the 27 Member States of the EU received 1 150 980 asylum seekers between 2005 and 2009, whereas in Canada and the US the corresponding figure was 391 090.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I therefore believe that these figures speak for themselves. Many have asked for clarification of the exact schedule that the Hungarian Presidency intends to follow. There is no debate among us that we must move forward; the issue is an extremely urgent one. I also said this in January, when the refugee situation was not yet as acute with regard to North Africa as it is now. This means that we have already had concrete plans, and we intend to accelerate this work. As you know, the Belgian Presidency, with a view to adhering to the 2012 deadline, proposed the strategy that we focus on four priority laws. You are familiar with all this; they are the Qualification Directive, the Dublin Regulation, the Eurodac Regulation, and the Long-term Residence Directive.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Talks have also continued in connection with the two directives that require the most work, namely the Procedures Directive and the Reception Conditions Directive. At that time this strategy gained widespread support in the Council, Parliament and the Commission as well, and also yielded tangible results. As you know, Parliament and the Council reached an agreement on the Long-term Residence Directive, and it will be adopted officially by the Council in a matter of weeks. With regard to the Qualification Directive, the Hungarian presidency has been given the mandate to begin the informal trialogue. Our goal is therefore to start this as soon as possible, and we ask the European Parliament to be our partner in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards the Dublin and Eurodac Regulations, there has been significant progress in the Council, and only a few questions of a strongly political nature remain unresolved. As far as the Procedures and Reception Conditions Directives are concerned, the Commission announced that it intends to submit a new proposal. In the previous cycle the European Parliament closed the first reading of the Reception Conditions Directive, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is currently examining the Commission’s proposal for the amendment of the Procedures Directive. This means that both the European Parliament and the Council are currently clarifying their positions. This will enable the two legislators to begin talks on the Qualification Directive and the Dublin and Eurodac Regulations. As soon as the Commission submits its proposals concerning the Procedures and Reception Conditions Directives, work can continue on these two laws as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards North Africa, I mentioned the Presidency visits to the frontier zone due to the current situation. We will evaluate the migration situation at the 11 April meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council. However, I would like to indicate already at this point, as there has been some criticism here in this regard, that the current draft conclusions of the European Council also make reference to the importance of the refugee situation. If we deem it necessary, we will assess the progress of the work. We are also prepared to schedule one more special meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council during the Hungarian Presidency. We are therefore endeavouring to accelerate the legislative work. We would like to inspire you, as well as the European Commission, to do the same. Many, including Mr Coelho, have mentioned this problem related to the amendment of the asylum decision. Well, as I have also said in my introduction, there is agreement on the political content, and we are now trapped in a legal issue. As, by the way, there is a debate between the Council and Parliament as to whether we should resolve several issues, from novel food to various foreign policy and external financial instruments, by way of an implementing act or a delegated act.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to state that this is a very important question. This legal procedure, and the question of what implementing or delegated act means, takes quite some effort for citizens, for EU citizens, to comprehend. Our task is to find solutions to matters of utmost urgency by whatever legal formula. I strive very hard to adhere to the Treaty of Lisbon with every action I take. The Treaty does not draw a clear line between the individual acts. We believe that this is an implementing act, and the issue should therefore be regulated in this manner, by way of an implementing act. Let us talk about it and consult. We would, however, very much like to avoid becoming entrapped in legal matters. Our original plans for the June European Council already included that we address refugee issues, and this has now become an even greater priority. However, I believe that if we can fill the Council meetings with the appropriate substance – and it is our duty to do so – then the European Council, too, will be able to take decisions of greater importance than we had otherwise hoped, let’s say, just one or two months ago.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I was also asked a question as to what will happen if the flow of refugees comes in this direction. I think that we should not yet be imagining things. We have done a great deal so far in the area of refugee issues in the various Council formations. The Commission is holding its ground exceptionally well on humanitarian issues, as do, by the way, the Egyptian and Tunisian authorities and the local population, as well as the international refugee organisations. It seems to me that everyone is in control of the situation. Repatriation, which is the most urgent issue, is proceeding. This does not mean that these resettlements, for example, are not relevant.</p>
      <p sl="hu">By the way, despite the fact that we have a legal problem that we have been unable to settle as yet – anyone is free to do so on a voluntary basis –, as far as I know, Italy has already voluntarily resettled 125 people, meaning that the issue is already partially being resolved after all, thanks to the honest efforts of the Member States. This does not mean that there is no need for the legislation. There is a very real need for it. Let us try to come to an agreement. Thank you very much for your attention, and as the Hungarian Presidency announced at one time that it will be a presidency that can prove that it also has a heart, as also expressed by our focus on the Roma strategy, I would like to assure you that this is also the case with regard to refugee matters. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, Parliament is representing the concerns of many European citizens as it pays increased attention to US authorities requesting data from media communications companies after WikiLeaks’ leaking of American state secrets. The Council naturally shares Parliament’s concerns about respect for EU data protection rules. However, it is not in the possession of information from which it could determine whether the US court procedure was in violation of EU data protection laws. As regards the case of WikiLeaks, as referred to by several Members, the United States Attorney General has publicly admitted that there is an ongoing criminal investigation. As far as I know, US attorneys urged, in connection with this investigation, that an American court order Twitter to hand over specific data in a ruling, and the court did adopt the relevant ruling.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is not the task of the Council to comment upon how the US judicial authorities take their decisions. Additionally, it does not even possess information on the basis of which it could question the validity of a reasoned court ruling. There have been court proceedings in the United States where Twitter was able to defend its own position. This is also proven by the fact that the American court upheld Twitter’s request to inform its clients about the court ruling. The European Union generally respects the court proceedings of third countries. It is self-evident that when investigating a suspected criminal offence, prosecution authorities must obtain information. It is also a well-known fact that the US procedure for obtaining information differs from that followed by the majority of EU Member States. The main difference lies in that it has a wider scope, meaning that it allows for far more information to be requested from a far greater number of persons than a general European criminal investigation or procedure.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is quite simply the result of the development of US law, meaning that it is not a matter upon which the Council should express its opinion. The enforcement of EU data protection rules is generally the responsibility of Member State authorities, and, more specifically, data protection authorities. These authorities must ensure that data protection rules are respected, and it is these authorities that have competence over matters of jurisdiction and compatibility with European or national data protection laws. It would be inappropriate to make matters investigated in court proceedings the subject of political judgement. Considering the broader context of the issue, the Council is unaware of a similar court ruling having been adopted before. When US authorities previously intended to obtain information relating to EU citizens that was stored within the territory of the EU, the European Union engaged in negotiations with the United States for the conclusion of an international agreement on handing over and processing the aforementioned data.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This was the case, for example, with regard to the Passenger Name Record or PNR, in connection with which there is a PNR agreement, concluded with the United States in 2007, the renegotiation of which is currently in progress, upon the very initiative of Parliament. A similar case is that of handing over financial messaging data stored in the European Union to the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, or TFTP, of the US Department of Finance. The relevant TFTP agreement was approved by Parliament in July 2010.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, I would like to stress that the Twitter case is completely different from the PNR or TFTP cases. The latter two involve US authorities systematically and continuously requesting personal data for the purpose of combating crime, and especially for the fight against terrorism. The Twitter case, on the other hand, is about a specific court ruling adopted by a court in a specific criminal investigation. It is important for us to recognise the rulings of the courts of other countries as much as possible. Except, of course, in cases where there are factors justifying the opposite. Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in a globalised world, the protection of personal data transferred to third countries is an increasingly important and legally very complex issue. It goes without saying that the fundamental right to the protection of personal data also applies in the electronic world and in cross-border data processing. Nevertheless, as with other fundamental rights, there may be limitations to this right; any such limitations must comply with the law and they must be proportionate. They must also be justified by legitimate interests: national security, public safety, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under US law, a subpoena is an administrative order compelling an individual to provide a State or local administrative agency with specific information. The legality of an act must be determined on the basis of the law of the country where the act is carried out. Therefore, the assessment of the legality, proportionality and necessity of the US Government’s requests must be based on the US Constitution and its legal system. The Commission has no competence as regards the manner in which a third country applies its judicial procedure in investigating suspected criminal activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">When European citizens use Twitter, they express their consent to Twitter’s privacy policy. This policy describes its procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of personal information to third parties, including when it is necessary in order to comply with laws, regulations or legal requests from the US Government. Furthermore, as these personal data are sought from Twitter by the US authorities in the context of criminal investigations, the EU’s data protection legislation is not applicable. The EU’s Data Protection Directive does not apply to state activities in the area of criminal law, nor does a framework decision on data protection in police and judicial cooperation apply in this case, given that no EU Member State authority is involved in executing the US court order and that no personal data is transmitted or made available by the competent authority of another Member State. So that is how the law stands today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The global dimension of data processing should not, however, imply a lowering of the level of protection for EU citizens. Indeed, global processing activity demonstrates how important and necessary it is to protect data subject rights and clarify the applicable rules. This is particularly important nowadays, when more and more data are in the cloud.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what are we going to do about this? First, the Commission’s forthcoming proposal to reform the EU data protection framework will focus in particular on the challenges posed by globalisation and modern technologies, most of all when third-country operators target EU consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, as you know, on 3 December 2010, the Council gave the Commission a solid mandate with clearly defined EU objectives for negotiating the future EU-US data protection agreement in the area of police and judicial cooperation. One of the EU’s main objectives in the forthcoming negotiations is to ensure enforceable data protection rights to data subjects on both sides of the Atlantic, regardless of nationality, and providing effective administrative and judicial redress. I am counting on Parliament to help this happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what are we doing in the meantime, before that new instrument becomes effective? I would strongly recommend that operators be very transparent upstream with their consumers and that they indicate clearly that their service is operating primarily under US law as far as criminal investigations are concerned. Therefore it is clear that consumers are leaving EU jurisdiction even if they do not leave EU territory themselves.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the clarifications. We are faced with a problem that is typical of the globalised world in which we live. The fact is that we, naturally, respect US law. It is also a fact that we are aware of the difficulties that arise with the global medium of the Internet and law enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the fact that law enforcement agencies are now accessing private databases on a routine basis is something that requires a response from us. Commissioner, your words struck a chord with me because I share your ideas about how we should proceed, namely that we should regulate this matter in a dedicated future revision of the EU data protection framework, while at the same time taking the opportunity to say that we also wish to regulate and promote the EU-US Data Protection Framework Agreement because we see the need to regulate such data transfers in this global world.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore important to remain focused on this issue, as I said earlier. Naturally, it is not our intention that such a process should cast a negative light on the processing of data. However, it is good to provide a positive example here by drafting good laws, developing the framework agreement and, in particular, better illuminating and regulating the area of law enforcement in relation to access to private data and the criteria for permitting and ending such access.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think that the Commissioner, skilfully as usual, anticipated the questions that we have. First of all, what do we do in the meantime when it is now public knowledge that the US has issued a number of subpoenas directed at social networks and internet service providers like Yahoo, Twitter and Google? This clearly gives the US access to information about data-sharing between WikiLeaks and third entities. Of course, it is the third entities – European citizens, people who are perfectly innocently accessing the internet, young people, people who are curious – who will be the targets and who will be damaged by this data regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has huge implications for the right to privacy of all EU citizens. Those who signed up to tweets by WikiLeaks due to an interest in the ongoing Assange case are ironically left vulnerable to US subpoenas and collection of their personal data. Sites like Twitter are subject to US legislation, as their servers are based in the US. Although I understand when you say that we cannot affect the law of third countries, we can do something in the interim.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is a legitimate concern for all of us in this House that we have to explain to our constituents what protection they can have from the European Union. What is the point of ensuring data protection standards for EU citizens if they can simply be lifted at the request of a US subpoena?</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that more has to be done to safeguard the personal data of EU citizens, who should be protected by strong, high-level EU legislation. I know that you are working on that aim. Until now, Framework Directive 94/46 has provided very strong protection in the internal market, but the time has come to review the directive, increase the level of protection and extend the same protective measures to judicial and police cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will ensure that these objectives are reached through our future legislative work, and you have mentioned that. In this respect, one of the main elements that the Commission intends to introduce in the review is EU protection to withstand the US subpoenas. We must remember that this issue does not stop at sites like Twitter, but can apply in cases of national jurisdiction. We have this in one of our own Member States today with the UK census, which is a massive undertaking being overseen by an American company. This is a genuine and ongoing concern of EU citizens. You have given some partial answers today, but I think we are right to raise this and to get more detailed answers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission. I am pleased to note that they share our concern. Let us be very clear: I do not think anybody here is claiming that the US was acting outside its jurisdiction. That is not the problem. The problem is that its jurisdiction, through the internet, becomes extremely vast. Its jurisdiction seems to extend even into the European Union, because the problem here is that although the vast majority of the internet-based companies we are talking about are based in the US, many of the users are based in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should point out that this oral question is already a bit out of date, as there has been another court ruling in the meantime, but the argument that is being used by the American courts is that once you use Twitter, as in this case, you cannot have a legitimate expectation of privacy any more. That means that anybody based in the European Union – EU citizens – no longer have any legal protection, because Twitter is US-based. As Commissioner Reding pointed out, that is a huge problem that must be addressed in the context of the review of the Data Protection Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, you say that once someone has used Twitter they have given consent, but what does ‘consent’ really mean? It means that we become outlaws, that we abandon our rights to legal protection. I realise there is very little that we can do here, but I would like to ask what the Commission and the Council will do to provide legal protection to EU citizens. Will they talk to our American counterparts and try and get more information? There are probably other companies that have been subpoenaed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, you say, Commissioner, that this case cannot be compared to SWIFT because it concerns a very specific investigation, which is true. At the same time, they have requested large amounts of …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that this is yet another case in which we are debating the fact that different legal cultures obtain on either side of the Atlantic when it comes to personal data and, in particular, when it comes to police and judicial cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am actually shocked by the response from the Council, stating that the company Twitter is located in the territory of the United States and therefore the measures and legal framework applied there has nothing to do with us. I think that is wrong. I also believe that the citizens of the European Union will view things differently; after all, we are continuously increasing international cooperation at policing and judicial levels, particularly with the United States; people are increasingly confronted with the laws of other states, by which I do not just mean the laws of different Member States within the European Union, but also, in particular, US law. This is particularly the case when it comes to personal data.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would expect the Council, as the governing body of the European Union, to take up this problem and to enable the citizens of the European Union to have confidence in the laws that they encounter on the Internet, in particular as they affect their civil rights and liberties.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party attaches particular importance to everyone’s privacy and to data protection. We are not being short-sighted here, just pragmatic. However, privacy has its limits. Privacy should be guaranteed wherever possible, but the security of civilians must be secondary to the prevention and detection of terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, contemporary terrorism is dominated by Islamic terrorism. That is the reason why we all, unfortunately, need to sacrifice a little bit of our privacy, in order to protect the security of our citizens. Obviously, the personal data of internet users, such as IP addresses, ought to be protected. This right to protection, however, is outweighed where there is a strong suspicion that the individuals who are hiding behind that data have terrorist motives.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If the US authorities ask for data on individuals on EU territory who are associated with terrorism, they should simply be given it, but, obviously, only after proper consultation and where there are strong arguments for this, so that we can prevent abuse. However, let us, above all, not forget that they are not asking for information just for kicks. They have very good reasons for doing so.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mrs Reding, I am grateful that you are here this late in the evening at this plenary debate in Brussels to listen to the Members of the European Parliament, and I would offer you my encouragement in your work on redefining EU data protection standards. In particular, I should like to mention the Commission communication on data protection, which you should present as a real opportunity to bring into alignment the revolution in technology and knowledge tools, on the one hand, and, on the other, advances in European constitutional law like the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, fundamental rights to privacy, and all rights linked to accessing, rectifying and cancelling any personal data, in line with the European public’s freedom to give their consent, but also in line with international law. This is because we are talking here about a bilateral framework for the European Union and its Member States to negotiate with third countries, and with the United States in particular.</p>
      <p sl="es">Messages on this need to be very clear: Council Framework Decision 2008/977 and Directive 95/46/EC must be updated and brought up to the minute. This is not just in order to be able to provide the United States with police and juridical cooperation in line with the technique of subpoena aid or with any judicial orders that could affect fundamental rights, but also to reinforce the principle of freely giving consent, of knowing what personal data are in possession of third countries and are transferred to third countries, and of how we can also update this right to rectify and cancel any data that affect personal privacy and that undergo automated processing of personal data. Therefore, they are submitted to online processing.</p>
      <p sl="es">What concerns me in particular is the issue of the rights of the child. This is because there are limits on the capacity of minors to act and on their capacity to possess the right to exercise fundamental rights, about which we need information. It is not just minors, but the minors’ surroundings that are affected by techniques and tools for protecting online privacy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore want you to know that we will follow this discussion very closely. We will follow the process of updating data protection rights and bringing them up to the minute very closely and, in particular, the negotiation of bilateral tools with third countries, in particular the United States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the old saying ‘I love treason but I hate a traitor’ is something that is proven true over and over again. Anyone who blows the whistle on wrongdoing is celebrated as a hero by the public and the media, but viewed as a betrayer by the affected institutions. Thus, as we know, US Private Bradley Manning has gone to prison for passing information to WikiLeaks. The way in which this explosive information is handled in the land of unlimited opportunity and liberty and the fact that Twitter was compelled to reveal personal data is worse than ominous. It remains to be seen whether the widely rumoured demands by the US authorities for user data from other Internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon prove true.</p>
      <p sl="de">The approach taken by the US authorities and the fact that the courts do not view the publication of names, e-mail addresses and banking details as a violation of privacy are certainly symptomatic of overseas data protection provisions, which are obviously still in their infancy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I have been writing a report for my committee on this issue. I want to thank Ms Reding for the Green Paper on which that was based, because I think that one of the core, ambitious issues that she raised in there is at the core of what we have been discussing tonight. She was saying that if, as a European citizen, my data was held on a server or database in a country outside Europe’s jurisdiction, I should have the same rights over that data as I would have if the server was within the European Union. That is a really ambitious programme. I hope we can achieve that. It will need a lot of negotiation.

      <p sl="hu">I would like to inform you that nothing demonstrates the commitment of the Hungarian Presidency to data protection better than the fact that, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in February, we adopted Council conclusions on the subject of data protection, comprising about fifty items. In this we also addressed two very important questions to the Commission that are relevant to the present debate. We called attention to the importance of informing citizens, as well as to the importance of Internet-related data protection, and I am certain, as the Commissioner has also mentioned, by the way, that the Commission will take these into account when drafting its proposal.</p>

We are looking forward to receiving the proposal for a new data protection directive from the Commission.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0038/2011) by Mr Schwab, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights (COM(2008)0614 – C7-0349/2008 – 2008/0196(COD)).</p>

    <intervention id="3-221-000" speaker_id="28223" name="Andreas Schwab" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my thanks to all my fellow Members who worked on this directive and on the compromise under debate today. I say this not out of politeness, but out of sincere gratitude. They were Mrs Wallis from the Committee on Legal Affairs as the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee, Mrs Gebhardt, Mrs Turunen and Mr Rochefort, as well as Mr Triantaphyllides and Mr Bielan. Reaching a decision was not always an easy process, with more than 2 000 amendments tabled over the course of two years, but the discussions were always constructive and I thank you all sincerely for that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite all the technical differences on individual issues, which are given expression in the various compromises, there is general cross-group agreement on today’s signal from the European Parliament that we wish to develop the internal market in the interests of consumers and businesses. After all, even twenty years after the internal market was established through the Single European Act, we still find that, despite a host of directives and regulations, true standardisation has not been achieved. The Member States have exploited their room for manoeuvre, sometimes justly, but sometimes unjustly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The directive before us today establishes a good middle way that regulates the issues relating to the internal market, while leaving legislative decisions on all other matters to the Member States themselves. We can go far with this mixed approach and will garner support from all sides of the House. This has involved supporting the Commission’s proposal, while also improving it considerably at many points. We have ensured that consumer protection is given appropriate importance in this Directive by establishing a uniform fourteen-day right of withdrawal for all online contracts on an EU-wide basis; by giving consumers dealing with door-to-door sales the choice of whether to receive a printed copy or an electronic copy of the contract document; by providing a ‘button solution’ to bring greater transparency to Internet business and at the same time to really step up the fight against Internet scams; and, by finally establishing uniform obligations to provide information, in particular in relation to pricing, in other words full pricing information for all Internet and door-to-door transactions.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we have also made the directive practicable for small and medium-sized enterprises and small contractors by providing greater flexibility and exclusions for services, in particular, in many areas; by permitting consumers to withdraw from agreements by telephone; by removing some opportunities for businesses to implement unfair contract terms, while at the same time setting down clear conditions for consumers for the return of ordered goods when a purchase is cancelled; and, by finally establishing a uniform withdrawal form that will make it easier for many people throughout Europe to access and exercise their right of withdrawal.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the end, thanks also to the process of consultation between the Member States, we will succeed in making further legal developments in this important area of consumer protection much less complicated at Council level than has been the case in the past. The Commission will have a clear right to be heard at Council level because there can be no doubt that a common market requires common rules. We saw this more clearly than ever during the Euro crisis. It is not enough to espouse common principles only to allow the Member States full freedom in the end – common principles must be adhered to through common rules. That is why this Directive aims to protect consumers. After all, consumers will be aware of their rights if they are the same throughout Europe and will be able to pursue these rights more effectively against businesses who break the rules. The directive also protects small and medium-sized enterprises, above all, because a uniform set of regulations engenders legal certainty, enabling the cultural and commercial diversity we so often hear about to flourish. Thank you for your cooperation. I look forward to the forthcoming debate.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schwab, honourable Members, it is a great pleasure for me that we were finally able to include the debate on this proposal in the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As you know, the Council came to an agreement on the subject in December last year, and on 24 January 2011, already during the Hungarian Presidency, the Council officially adopted its preliminary position, that is, the general approach.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order to reach an agreement, we had to negotiate for over two years in the Council about what the ideal balance between EU and Member State legislation granting consumers’ rights would be, and which aspects of consumer rights could be harmonised accordingly. Nothing illustrates the difficulties surrounding this proposal better than the fact that the Council working party needed more than sixty meetings to create a text that the qualified majority of the Member States could support. Additionally, it has proven impossible to reach an agreement on chapters four and five of the Commission proposal, which concern the sale of goods and unfair contract terms, respectively. Due to the prevailing difficulties, the Council finally decided to omit these two chapters from the text and to focus instead on off-premises and distance contracts. This approach was also supported by the Commission, since the Council’s text creates added value with regard to such contracts at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Presidency believes that the European Parliament could give further impetus to the debate. This is why tomorrow’s vote on the proposed draft amendments will be so important. If the European Parliament decides in tomorrow’s plenary sitting to refer the dossier back to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Hungarian Presidency will endeavour to ensure with great commitment that an agreement is reached at first reading. We are prepared to make every effort necessary to this end. Naturally, a very great deal will depend on what kind of amendments Parliament proposes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As I have already mentioned, there is a significant difference of opinion between Member States concerning the contents of chapters four and five, that is, the issue of whether certain aspects of sales terms and warranties, as well as unfair contract terms, need to be fully harmonised. The Presidency believes that the reason why it would be necessary for us to focus on other provisions of the directive, that is, chapters one and three, is that this is where we can create true European added value. As regards these points, the Council’s general approach does not differ significantly from Parliament’s draft amendments, which were carried by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the IMCO on 20 January and 1 February, respectively.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we are ready to cooperate fully with Parliament and the Commission in order to achieve success. I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the rapporteur and Chair of the IMCO Committee, Mr Harbour, and all members of the IMCO Committee for their full cooperation which they have so far provided to the Hungarian Presidency. I do not know what the final outcome will be, and whether we will be entirely satisfied with the results of our negotiations, but I am convinced that we must not waste the opportunity to grant EU citizens consumer rights that have a far broader scope than before.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, next year we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market. We have to ensure that the single market brings benefits to consumers and to businesses. Over two years of negotiations have shown that it is politically very difficult to reach an agreement on the whole directive on the basis of what was proposed by the Commission. Many of you do not want to see – and rightly so – a decrease in the level of national consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now well into the third year of discussion on this piece of legislation. I believe it is high time for the co-legislators to find a solution. In this regard, I am particularly grateful to your committees, to the rapporteurs, to Mr Schwab and Ms Wallis and to the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work in search of a compromise. The Council agreed on a general approach at the beginning of the year. It has decided to considerably narrow the scope of the proposal and to specifically target distant and off-premises contracts.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes that the Council’s general approach is a good starting point in our search for a good compromise. In broad terms, it is consistent with the aim of improving the functioning of the internal market while creating added value for consumers. I know that, by your amendments, you seek additional improvements. I can see many reasonable suggestions for further increases in consumer protection and, as I have said before, the Consumer Rights Directive should be a rights directive. It should be worthy of that name.</p>
      <p sl="en">To give you some examples: I could easily except your Amendment 122, which ensures that consumers will not be charged for sending back goods after a withdrawal if they are worth more than EUR 40. I am also not opposed to the extension of the withdrawal period to one year if the consumer was not informed of his right of withdrawal (Amendment 116). I could also support a harmonised solution for fighting so-called internet cost traps (Paragraph 1(a) and (b) of Amendment 107).</p>
      <p sl="en">It will not come as a surprise to you when I say that I cannot accept all your amendments which are now on the table. For example, Amendment 141. Even if my goal is also to serve the internal market, it is going a step too far to oblige distance traders to supply goods or deliver services in any other Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">After all this time, and notwithstanding the differences which do remain, I see light at the end of the tunnel. I am confident that an acceptable and balanced compromise is now within our reach. I will do what I can to help you reach such a compromise.</p>

I would like to thank Mr Schwab for his work on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. Over the years, we have clearly seen the difficulties posed by differing legal concepts, which form a barrier to real consumer possibilities and SME possibilities within the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made some progress with the agreement that we now have in Parliament. Sadly, I think that the Legal Affairs Committee would have liked to have done more, for example in Chapter 5 on unfair terms, and particularly in the area of transparency. Our committee would really like to make progress in that area. I know that the Council feels that it is perhaps a step too far. For us, however, it is a step that could be very important in terms of the internal market and, indeed, in terms of consumer rights, as you put it so well, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have come a long way. We have reviewed the consumer acquis. We have not gone through all the directives that the Commissioner’s predecessor wanted us to review.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Schwab on the work he has done so far and the excellent cooperation between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>
      <p sl="it">Providing for varying degrees of harmonisation of standards will allow us to achieve important results, which will provide real added value for European citizens. Significant among these are the fourteen-day right of withdrawal and the new rules on information requirements, not only on price but also on the identity and address of the seller. These improvements will increase consumer confidence, especially in cross-border shopping by providing the legal certainties essential for the development of e -commerce.</p>
      <p sl="it">This directive will also lay the foundation for other complementary measures, from the reform of European contract law to the process of reviewing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This fundamental harmonisation action is an essential condition for the development of an internal market focused on the rights of its consumers and serving the citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">About a year ago, Professor Monti said in his report to President Barroso: ‘Consumers and consumer welfare should be at the centre of the next stage of the single market’. First, the law-maker should reach early agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, to ensure a high level of protection in an integrated retail market. This provision fully meets the demands, and I am convinced that Mr Schwab will maintain the necessary determination in the complex negotiations that will follow before the final adoption of the text.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did indeed experience some very tough negotiations, Mr Schwab, as opinions were very divided at the start of discussions. Likewise, it was not easy to decide on a reasonable course of action.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, these negotiations did succeed in achieving significant improvements, even after the vote at committee level, which finally made it possible for my group to vote in favour of this compromise package tomorrow. After all the discussions we have held, you will be aware of how much this means.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have indeed made a number of improvements. Accordingly, the fundamental principle followed in the directive is now, once again, minimum harmonisation – with the exception of the areas that are to be fully harmonised, which was an important concern for us. We excluded social services, healthcare services and games of chance from the scope of this directive because these are the areas that require special regulation. You cannot apply the same principles to them as to commercial services, commodities or retailing and so this was an important consideration. We have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens, the consumers. For this reason I would like to make it clear to the President-in-Office of the Council that the idea of dropping Chapter 2, in other words removing exactly the areas where this obligation to provide information is to apply, is something that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not tolerate.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have included electronic products in the scope of the directive, something not envisaged in the Commission’s original proposal. However, distance selling via the Internet is one of the key areas that has been included. As we reached the home straight, we also succeeded in improving the provisions on door-to-door selling. These are positive improvements that have enabled us to lend our support.</p>
      <p sl="de">I cannot deny that a few problems still exist, in particular the clauses relating to unfair contract terms in Chapter 5. We are very dissatisfied with these provisions and will either have to do some more work here or, if necessary, omit this section entirely. However, something that causes even more difficulty is the fact that financial services have been completely excluded from the obligations to provide information. I think we have a serious problem here. We will have to discuss this further, Commissioner, because financial services were included in your proposals and this should remain the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">To summarise: we will vote in favour of the compromise package and will also vote to refer the directive back to committee, but this does not mean that we agree to adopt the directive at first reading.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this text is important. It is not a revolution: we cannot say that everything before was bad and now everything is perfect. Nevertheless it does offer a number of major advances at this provisional stage in our work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To my mind, the main advances concern better regulation for distance selling, especially over the Internet (chapter III), for consumer rights in this area need to be enhanced. E -commerce is very useful: it widens consumers’ choice, allows them to find the lowest prices and also enables small and medium-sized enterprises and craftspeople to find new outlets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To move forward in this area, we needed to do it in a genuinely European way, namely by carrying out, for a few very specific points, a complete harmonisation of everyone’s rights and duties. In very specific terms, an Italian customer buying something on a Belgian or German website will know that from now on, he or she will enjoy the same rights and the same protection. This is what this directive will enable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It means that the consumer’s cooling off period will be extended to 14 days throughout the Union. It means that he or she will know straight away the total amount to be paid, without fearing a nasty surprise later on. It means that with the double-click, he or she will review the order correctly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, all this is going to upset a few habits. In many Member States, national law contains subtleties that are regarded by everyone as fundamental, when often these are nowhere to be found in neighbouring countries. Living together in Europe is about learning to change one's habits slightly for the benefit of Community and general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be clear: this text still needs to be improved and we will have to do so in the coming weeks, with the Council and with the Commission. I welcomed the openness that has just been shown in this respect. We have already done a substantial amount of work thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Schwab, whom I wish to thank wholeheartedly. Yet the real achievement of this work is above all the fact that the amendments will be adopted tomorrow by all political groups. Consumers’ confidence in the Union’s internal market is very fragile. We needed this unanimous political support in order to preserve this confidence and to hope to strengthen it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like, firstly, to express my thanks to Mr Schwab, the rapporteur for the report under discussion, for showing such great commitment to the work on the draft of this directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Two and a half years of intensive work on this document have led to the achievement of a compromise, which in its final form – I hope – will guarantee greater legal certainty to the consumers of the 27 Member States in the area of distance selling, and in particular when making Internet transactions. I hope, too, that thanks to this directive consumers will have greater confidence in cross-border trade and online purchases as a result of improvements to and harmonisation of some new rights and the greater clarity given to those which already exist. Moreover, by standardisation of information requirements for distance and off-premises contracts, for example, the directive is also intended to encourage a greater number of traders to enter the new markets in the European Union, which should in turn improve the performance of the internal market. I hope this will be a favourable stimulus, in particular for the popularisation of online selling. I hope, too, that it will benefit consumers by increasing competition for them in the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to highlight some of the most important matters. Firstly, we endeavoured to draft a text which would be balanced and which would work to the advantage of consumers throughout the Union, but also one which would not have an adverse effect on traders, and in particular on the operations of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, I am pleased that we were able to negotiate a pragmatic text, with the adoption of a mixed approach of minimum and maximum harmonisation, which means, therefore, that those Member States which already have a very high level of consumer protection on some matters have not suffered. We also managed to introduce uniform and clear provisions in specific cases, which means that transactions made over the Internet, for example, will be easier.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased, too, that in the Committee on Legal Affairs we managed to negotiate Chapter 5 on unfair contractual terms in a constructive form. This chapter regulates contracts which are not usually individually negotiated by consumers and are often a source of many abuses on the part of dishonest traders.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I regret, however, that despite the fact that we have reached agreement, the text of the directive still contains certain shortcomings. However, I am certain that with commitment we will be able to correct them at the next stage of negotiations and achieve specific benefits for consumers and for European traders because, after all, they must not be forgotten either.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schwab, the EU’s internal market is a cornerstone of our European cooperation and, as the Commission quite rightly wrote in its draft of the Single Market Act last year, citizens – we Europeans – must be at the centre of the work to develop the single market. It is important to remember that when we vote on the Directive on consumer rights in Parliament tomorrow – a directive that we have now been working on for many years. As we all know, the text that we are to vote on tomorrow has been comprehensively revised in relation to the draft that we received from the Commission in the autumn of 2008, as here in Parliament our focus has been on those areas where common EU rules will be of real benefit to both consumers and businesses. In turn, we wanted to allow the Member States to produce additional legislation where that makes sense.</p>
      <p sl="da">In specific terms, this means that European consumers will notice changes first and foremost when they shop on the Internet in foreign online shops. The new directive will mean that there are uniform rules for Internet trading in Europe, and that brings a number of advantages for consumers. Allow me to mention just three examples. Firstly, all consumers in Europe will have a 14-day withdrawal period when they buy something in an online shop in an EU Member State. Secondly, the overall price of the product must be specified before a consumer agrees to purchase a product. Thirdly, it has to be possible to contact the seller easily if problems arise. A fourth aspect that was very important to us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was to future-proof this Directive. A product is not only something that we can physically touch – these days it also includes intellectual goods. This could be an item of software or a piece of music that we download. I am therefore very pleased that digital products have now been included in the text.</p>
      <p sl="da">The proposal that will be voted on tomorrow, and which the Group of the Greens is able to support, is not a perfect piece of legislation. We wanted a broader, more ambitious directive, and we wanted to see progress in all areas. However, politics is also about the art of the possible, and this is what is possible right now. Overall, I believe that Parliament has achieved a reasonable result that will benefit consumers in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, as a political group, we established the principle of preventing any reduction in consumer rights in the European Union from the outset. Although very ambitious, the Commission’s initial proposal was unable to meet the needs of all consumers in the European Union. That is why a red line was drawn through the proposal for a fully harmonised directive, when it became clear that it would equate to a lower level of protection for EU consumers.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are two especially important elements in Parliament’s proposal for the directive. We have before us a completely new proposal by Parliament, very different from that proposed by the Commission and with a different outlook from the Council. The nucleus of this proposal is a mixed approach in terms of harmonisation, leaving the Member States free, if they so choose, to set a higher level of consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second point has to do with exemptions from the scope of the directive. We insisted from the outset that social services, health services and gambling should be exempted from the scope of this directive, as they have nothing to do with the relationship between trader and consumer and take a different approach. We are satisfied that this was taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="el">Support for Parliament’s proposal does not under any circumstances signal unconditional support for the Commission proposal. On the contrary, we are seeking a strong cohesive position and we call on the Commission and the Council to take very serious account of the nucleus of Parliament’s proposal, especially as regards the degree of harmonisation and other provisions for sales contracts.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, customer rights is only one of many examples of how European institutions have enormous difficulty in performing acts of great legal and political importance at this historic moment.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do not want to waste all the work done and the positive things achieved, for example, the contribution of our amendment on the right of recourse, aiming to introduce a distinct improvement in the activity of small traders without harming consumer rights. If the outcome of negotiations with the Council will be to cancel out the good things that the rapporteur and the groups introduced in a proposal that was bad from the outset, or whether the outcome will be to raise the general level of harmonisation of the Directive, we will have no option but to vote against it.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, the responsibility for this situation lies not with Parliament but with the European Commission. Over certain issues, we eurosceptics in the Northern League are ready to say yes to a high degree of harmonisation, but only when it coincides with common sense, the public interest, the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises, and why not, the prerogatives of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">An approach that takes account of all this was needed from the outset for an issue as complex as consumer protection. We welcome the withdrawal of many amendments that called into question issues that had been resolved. It is essential that the Council should accept the text that leaves the Chamber in full if it is compliant with the agreed amendments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, sometimes it is made more difficult for consumers to understand the consequences of their actions, for example, when they download digital content. Everyone is used to downloading content from the net free of charge. However, in some cases the charges are concealed from consumers and, therefore, they download a subscription without realising it, despite the fact that they only wanted a one-off service. What is needed here is a legal right of withdrawal.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another area which is open to criticism is the combination of distance and door-to-door sales, because it is much easier for people to be taken unawares on their own front doorstep. On the other hand, we must not impose unnecessary burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises with regard to off-premises contracts. For example, when consumers invite a tradesman or a hairdresser into their house of their own accord, they have no need of increased protection, because there is no question of them being taken by surprise. Therefore, we need sensible, wide-ranging protection for consumers, but it is also important for us to take the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the compromise we have in front of us is a very good step in the right direction. I welcome the consensus we have reached on the right to withdraw and on an information requirement for distance and off-premises contracts. However, we must have the courage to go further, in particular on remedies for lack of conformity, guarantees and unfair clauses.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have listened carefully to the arguments for years, but my vision has been and remains full harmonisation. I am convinced that common rules are win-win for consumers and business. Transparency, legal certainty and competition increase free choice for the consumer and decrease red tape for business. The challenge is to strike the right balance.</p>
      <p sl="en">For high consumer protection and low costs for business the Consumer Rights Directive should not become a tug of war between market and people. Nor should we live under a false assumption that national rules protect consumers, while common European rules benefit business. That picture is wrong. There is no way round the fact that extra costs for SMEs will become extra costs for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout the process the PPE Group has been flexible and constructive. The left has been rigid and obstructive, reducing the debate to a nitpicking exercise of comparative law, bargaining between national rules. I believe instead that the common interest of the European people should prevail. Minimum harmonisation and national exceptions, as advocated by the Social Democrats, simply hinder citizens from taking full advantage of a common market. At a time of crisis, faced with rising protectionism, it is as easy as it is irresponsible to be populist. I fully support Andreas Schwab in his wonderful job and I wish him well in the negotiations ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">I conclude by saying that the Consumer Rights Direcive is a milestone in the relaunch of the single market to inject confidence, to boost growth, competitiveness and the jobs that the European people are looking forward to.</p>

      <p sl="es">The parliamentary passage of this report is not over, therefore.</p>
      <p sl="es">The initial draft was a bad one. That is what consumers’ associations at national and European level told us. In particular, I have a high opinion of the Asturias Consumers’ Union and its President, the tireless Dacio Alonso.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have managed to have the old Article 4’s general principle of the maximum possible harmonisation reconsidered. We must state very loudly that establishing the maximum possible harmonisation across the Member States would reduce the protection of many consumers, since in many countries there is a greater tradition of protecting consumer rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, I should like to stress that it is essential to ensure that the list of unfair contract terms not be exhaustive, meaning that each Member State could increase the number of clauses that it considers unacceptable and invalid in contracts with consumers; that the burden of proof be reversed so that it becomes the trader that has to demonstrate that terms outside the norm have been negotiated individually; and that contract terms be expressed in a clear and comprehensible way.</p>
      <p sl="es">We remain opposed to the establishment of the maximum possible harmonisation as regards unfair terms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think you will find that I have two and a half minutes, because not all my colleagues are here. As Chair of the committee, I first of all want to pay tribute to all the Members who have worked on this. I am pleased that they are all here this evening, led by Andreas Schwab, with a very strong team of shadow members who displayed really intense interest and expertise in this whole complicated area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that it is right, as Viviane Reding says, that the co-legislators now have to move forward and make some decisions. The time this has taken is an indication of the political difficulties, both on the Council’s side and on Parliament’s side. I think that Parliament, as in many dossiers in the past, has shown that it has the ability to broker a compromise. I think that Parliament should vote on the amendments tomorrow, send a clear political signal about what we want, and then refer this back to committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank the Presidency and Ms Győri, who has been a most active advocate for the Presidency, for being open to our position as a result of that change. That does not mean that we are in any way committed to moving forward and closing those negotiations. However, we owe it to citizens and consumers to hold, at the very least, an open meeting to see if there is some basis for agreement. I think all colleagues are in tune with that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking at what we have here, I would say, first of all, that I admire Ms Corazza Bildt’s enthusiasm, but I do not really see this Consumer Rights Directive as a milestone. Frankly I think it is more a stepping stone, because there are still plenty of difficult waters around where we are treading at the moment. I think it is a first cautious step towards dealing with harmonisation on issues that cause great emotion and a lot of political agitation. Understandably, consumers and consumer organisations in different countries do not like to see rights taken away. I think that has been one of the biggest problems we have faced.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have a compromise that adds real value for consumers and for businesses, particularly in the areas of internet and cross-border trade. We must sustain those and also certain other areas, but my final word to the Commissioner is this: we desperately need a framework within which to make progress towards more harmonisation. We have a whole series of fragmented initiatives, including your work on consumer contracts, and other revisions. We desperately need that long-term strategic approach that will complete the stepping stones towards the milestone.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking Mr Schwab for the work he has put into this draft. He probably knows better than anyone that it was not an easy task. During our work on the directive we have often emphasised how important it is for consumers, but it is also important for trade, and in particular for e -commerce and cross-border purchases.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What consumers making online purchases want above all is a guarantee that the goods or services they have ordered will be supplied to them, and that they will correspond to the stated quality. We should therefore guarantee that regulations protecting consumers are clear and transparent. During this debate, however, we should not forget about traders, who expect regulations which do not place an excessive burden on them. Have we managed to reconcile the interests of consumers with the interests of traders during our work on this directive?</p>
      <p sl="pl">The discussions which have being going on for nearly two years have in my opinion brought us closer to this goal, but we have not yet achieved it. I believe that European consumers would benefit much more from a maximum level of regulatory harmonisation. It would make life much easier for companies operating in the field of e -commerce. I am however pleased that in respect of several key issues we have managed to find solutions which ideally meet consumers’ needs, while at the same time making allowances for the realities of doing business. As an example, I would like to mention the provisions stipulating a 14-day deadline for consumers to withdraw from a contract, and I also welcome the amendment giving traders the opportunity to make refunds dependent on the consumer supplying proof of postage. This is an essential feature of the directive, indicating that in certain cases there are also obligations incumbent upon consumers, as well as upon traders.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to encourage the Council and the European Commission to try to find an ambitious agreement.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mrs Gebhardt, for their work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission’s initial proposal was indeed absurd, as it endangered the level of consumer protection by wanting to harmonise it completely. This is only justifiable so long as harmonisation is upwards and not downwards, as proposed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore I welcome most of the compromises reached, which leave the possibility for Member States to apply stricter rules if they so wish, while guaranteeing a high minimum level for all consumers in the Union. Thus, maximum contract duration is limited to 12 months, information on distance contracts or telesales contracts is improved, with payment being required only when the cooling-off period, set at 14 days, has expired.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, it is unacceptable to keep full harmonisation regarding chapter V, relating to unfair terms. Not only is the chosen level of protection unsatisfactory, it is also tantamount to ignoring the reality of fraudulent practices, since these require a level of responsiveness that European legislation cannot offer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being the case, taking away all room for manoeuvre from Member States in this area seems like an irresponsible move. Consequently I hope that the colegislators manage to come up with a balanced text which guarantees a genuine and common core of high-level protection.</p>

I am pleased that he has managed to retain the two fundamental principles of the original Commission proposal: the principle of 'better regulation' by simplifying and updating the rules so as to eliminate the barriers on the internal market encountered every day by entrepreneurs doing business in EU countries, and the second principle of achieving the greatest possible harmonisation in consumer law, eliminating the many exemptions applied by individual states.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Despite the fact that we failed in the end to agree on full harmonisation in all chapters of the directive, this new arrangement will be a very significant step forwards, involving the elimination of barriers to cross-border trade and, in the final analysis, greater competition on the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am afraid that I am going to be the person to pour cold water on this. Despite the many improvements to the Commission proposal that were introduced during the consultation with the committees, for which we mainly have the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, to thank, in my opinion the current package contains an excessive number of regulations and will result in over-complex legislation. This will be very difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to cope with. In addition, it will not really benefit consumers, it will have very little effect in terms of harmonisation and it will not allow us to make progress with the internal market and with Europe as a business location.</p>
      <p sl="de">Given the small amount of time available, I can unfortunately only look at one point. The Commission proposal has massively extended the scope of two definitions and in this case it has gone much too far, which is clear from the fact that 1 600 amendments have been tabled. It has been difficult to discuss this sensibly in Parliament. In addition, the Commission has not given any justification for extending these definitions. Nowhere in the annexes or in the documents submitted to Parliament is there any form of justification for this. One of the two cases concerns distance sales contracts. Thankfully, this extension has been returned to the consultation process and has been amended, which is a very welcome move. However, the second case relates to off-premises contracts, which I would like to look at here.</p>
      <p sl="de">In future, any contract which is concluded outside a company’s business premises will be subject to a whole raft of regulations and rights of withdrawal, even if the consumer, as Mr Obermayr has just mentioned, has asked an electrician, decorator, painter or carpenter and so on to come into his house. I am aware that there is a whole series of exceptions to this which you, Mr Schwab, and the committee have improved, both in terms of their content and their wording. Nevertheless, this still leaves a huge number of legal pitfalls in place, which could prove disastrous for micro-businesses and small tradesmen and could even put their very existence at risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, this part of the proposal is superfluous. It could be deleted without causing any problems, together with chapter 4 and chapter 5. In that case, the rest of the proposal and the consultations would not be bad at all.</p>

I wish to thank them and, at the same time, to praise them, because they demonstrated a great deal of persistence and a great deal of patience in bringing us to the point that we have reached in the debate today and which, I think, provides a very good working basis for Commissioner Reding, whose words, in my opinion, give us reason to be optimistic.</p>
      <p sl="el">I personally consider than minimum harmonisation is a very good and, at the same time, a very pragmatic working basis. I come from a State, Greece, which has achieved a very high level of protection for consumer rights. As you will understand, I would not want this high level of consumer protection to be compromised.</p>
      <p sl="el">I admit that I was very concerned when Mr Schwab spoke – and this was the first I had heard of it – of maximum harmonisation. I remembered something I had read in a magazine: someone tried to make the most beautiful woman using an actress’s eyes, a singer’s nose and another actress’s mouth. The result was monstrous.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to the work by our rapporteur, Mr Schwab, which enables us today to reach a broad consensus across all political groups on this text, despite it getting off to a bad start.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, Europe should be synonymous with progress and practical achievements, and we see this with these proposals concerning consumers. Europeans, from now on, will be entitled to the right to withdraw from the contract when they purchase items on online auction platforms such as eBay.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have succeeded in presenting a text that will, on the one hand, strengthen the framework conditions for increasing cross-border trade within the European Union, and, on the other, save us from having to lower the level of consumer protection in Member States; on the contrary, the latter will be increased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I subscribe to the view that in order to consolidate our exit from the recession, we have to create new sources of growth, and that thanks to the simplification and rationalisation of European law, our businesses will be able to benefit more fully from the potential of the single market. Did you know that only 22% of purchases in Europe are cross-border ones? Providing a better regulatory framework for businesses is therefore also about contributing to economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When negotiating this text, we wanted to take an ambitious yet pragmatic approach. The principle was simple: no harmonisation without an equivalent level of protection. This is the reason why I am delighted that we have been able to keep certain aspects of national laws which the consumers of one or other Member State are very keen on. As far as we are concerned in France, our consumers can continue to take advantage of the protection offered by the ‘latent defect’ guarantee or the preservation of our very protective legislation for door-to-door selling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, we are showing today that the European Parliament, right-wing and left-wing parties together, is capable of responding to people’s day-to-day concerns, and I welcome that. The solution is of course more Europe, but not any kind. We need a Europe that protects, a Europe that reassures and a Europe that provides opportunities to Europeans, to citizens, to consumers and to businesses.</p>

Today’s world is evidently different. Today we must think about the rights of consumer, protection for consumers, and the legislation that will secure this. Customer satisfaction, it seems, is no longer always the best commercial policy, and there are almost too many examples from everyday life suggesting rather the opposite.</p>
      <p sl="cs">That is why it is so important to have a thorough debate on this legislation, which must not bring about a deterioration in consumer rights, but will have to respond to new challenges. We need to realise how different the starting points of the various EU countries are in respect of consumer rights. Our aim should be to enhance consumer protection in those places where legal chaos and uncertainty have prevailed so far, attracting a variety of crooks and undermining confidence in the internal market. On the other hand, we must retain a high level of consumer protection in those places where it already exists in an effective form. This is the basic approach taken by the Consumer Rights Directive, and I therefore fully support the position of my group. I would also like to thank all the rapporteurs, of course, for the extensive work they have carried out. Consumer protection is really not against the interests of honest businessmen.

All this matters most to those citizens and enterprises who wish to freely exercise their rights in commerce in the internal market. The rapporteur’s proposal that the minimum level of harmonisation in consumer protection should be accompanied by the full harmonisation of technical rules is the only acceptable regulatory solution in the present situation. The combination of minimum and full harmonisation can become an option that is acceptable for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The currently existing barriers to cross-border transactions hinder traders’ and customers’ activities across Member State borders. Statistics show that many are still averse to EU purchases over the Internet, and it would be welcome if we could change this, too. Furthermore, I would like to say, and here I am thinking mainly of Central and Eastern European Member States, that there is a great need for a comprehensive and constructive regulatory framework. A system founded on more transparent, common rules enhances consumer awareness, which is not yet fully mature in this region, but has been known in Western Europe for a long time. A developed consumer protection policy is also a means of supporting SMEs. We must therefore be cautious not to complicate their situation through legislation that is too strict.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A more precise definition of traders’ information obligations is a key aspect, which would contribute to increasing the number of market transactions that comply with the law and are fair from a commercial perspective. It is no coincidence that the Hungarian Presidency, too, considers this proposal for a directive as one of the priorities for its six-month term. It is symbolic and a signal that Parliament put this report on its agenda a couple of days after World Consumer Rights Day. By making the right decision, we can make life easier for nearly 500 million consumers and 22 million enterprises on the internal market of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, firstly may I congratulate Mr Schwab and his colleagues for the good work they have done for over two years now. Undoubtedly it has been a great achievement on their part. May I also commend Mrs Győri from the Hungarian Presidency: she is very enthusiastic, is here all day and is always in Strasbourg as well. I do not think that I have seen anyone else as enthusiastic as her so far.</p>
      <p sl="ga">This is about the internal market, harmonisation, adding value: all very important. It is not the final product, but it is a work in progress: particularly noteworthy are things such as the right of withdrawal, unfair contract terms and particularly the flexibility clauses which give flexibility to national governments. If we had the same in other directives such as the EGAF, they would work better. Finally, I just want to say that it complements work such as the Services Directive and the Data Protection Directive which I am working on. Therefore it is good progress.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and Mrs Gebhardt on the work they have done.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have a general thought. It is not that protectionism is increasing, but rather that it is a case of not removing rights that already exist in some of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is because if we want to set up a genuine internal market for relationships between companies and consumers and are pursuing that, we must establish, at the same time, a balance between a high level of protection for consumer rights and defence of companies’ competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="es">This balance involves agreeing on a minimum level of harmonisation, as well as the possibility of allowing the Member States to keep or adopt any additional regulations that improve consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot allow the adoption of EU legislation to mean that many consumers and users end up with less protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">I welcome the fact that negotiations in the European Parliament have improved, but I should like to insist that already-established rights not be removed.</p>

It took a long time to choose a line that would be balanced enough for both consumers and businesses. I welcome the overall compromise that has been agreed by all political groups and I believe that this is an important step forward for all consumers in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are significant improvements such as the provision of clear information requirements in contracts, and the harmonisation of the provisions on the right of withdrawal. Of course it is a compromise, it is not perfect. An example is Article 22a which obliges the trader to deliver in other Member States. There are products and services which due to their nature should not be covered here, namely perishable goods. Problems might also arise with digital products. The initial intention of promoting cross-border business is very important and is very good, and I really hope that during the forthcoming negotiations with the Council we will manage to make these adjustments to achieve an optimal result.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I think that every consumer should have the right to receive information prior to signing the contract. Retailers should inform consumers and obtain their consent, including in any circumstance where an amount is stopped on their credit or debit card.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is also important for us to protect consumers against unfair contractual terms. Unfortunately, in the case of banking services, insurance, electronic communication services or tourist services, the contractual clauses are very often written overleaf in tiny letters. However, customers very frequently sign the registration form or invoice without even reading the contractual clauses overleaf.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Even in cases where customers read all the contractual clauses and state that they disagree with one of them, they do not have any negotiating power. In this instance, the first response the consumer receives is that there is a standard company contract and it cannot be amended.</p>

They give Member States the option for derogations, while all this also represents a competitive disadvantage for the EU. It is to my satisfaction that Mr Schwab prepared such an excellent report. After several years of negotiating, the moment has come to reach an agreement on this matter, and, as Minister Győri has said, the Hungarian Presidency will also strive for this. In order to reduce the fragmentation of the EU internal market we need a stronger enforcement of consumer rights, and to enable consumers to take better decisions without putting enterprises at a disadvantage due to the new legislation. The single internal market requires single European consumer rules. It is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to join those who said that this has been an excellent debate. It has been a very constructive debate and, on behalf of the Hungarian Presidency and our experts, we would like to thank you for your support, and I hope that we will be able to continue further consultations in the same atmosphere. Let me address some specific questions that were raised in the debate. Many have urged for the regulation of the lists of unfair contract terms. We agree with the European Parliament in that there would be added value in having a list at European level. However, although the legislation in force contains an indicative list of examples, added value would in fact be in the creation of a single European list. There is not yet sufficient support for this in the Council, however, and this is one of the reasons why the Council decided to omit the issue.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There were some who asked, although Mrs Gáll-Pelcz answered this one for me, why it would be necessary for us to reach an agreement at first reading. As it has been said, we began negotiations in October 2008, during the French Presidency. Over the course of two and a half years we held more than sixty working party meetings, and we therefore consider that there are no more possibilities for adjustment in order to resolve the blocking minorities, and that is why we had to decide on a significant narrowing of the scope of the directive to distance and off-premises contracts. The narrowed scope and thus the targeted harmonisation will, I am convinced, lead to a more rapid agreement, and I do not see what added value could come forth from continuing and having a second reading.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The preliminary position of the European Parliament is in several respects close to the general approach of the Council, and I therefore believe that we should not, and urge us all not to waste this opportunity to have an agreement at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I liked Mr Harbour’s comment on whether the current situation is a stepping stone or a milestone. If we want to be realistic – and I am not a person who likes to exaggerate – I think it is a stepping stone, not a milestone. It could have been a milestone, but the conditions were simply not right. We can see it as a stepping stone when we consider the interests of our citizens and our consumers.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We all know that there are very different legal conditions in the Member States. Fuller harmonisation at this stage would not have been possible. It is much better to have a smaller scope and be able to have an agreement. This will really help increase consumers’ rights and therefore also help us move towards completion of the single market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the question of whether or not this is a milestone is one which could be discussed at great length. It is clear, for example, that the founders of the European Community, such as Altiero Spinelli, whom we have named our group meeting room after today, were able to deal with more fundamental questions in Europe. However, I am convinced that nowadays progress in Europe takes the form of small, constructive steps. For this reason, I would like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the discussion and who have made this compromise possible as a result of their contributions to the amendments. A compromise is always an opportunity to achieve a balance between different interests. No one will be completely happy, but everyone will be prepared to improve the approach that has been taken even further. This is why I believe that we are on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Reding, for her ongoing commitment and for her support and encouragement both today in this debate and in many other meetings.

That said, however, I am quite worried about some of the measures and their impact on small and medium-sized enterprises.

      <p sl="en">The proposed Consumer Rights Directive harmonises into one legal document a total of four directives dealing with off-premises contracts, unreasonable terms in consumer contracts, consumer protection in distance contracts and certain aspects of the selling of consumer goods and guarantees. The aim of merging these four directives is to enhance the internal market and promote cross-border trade. A high level of consumer protection will enhance product quality and increase consumer confidence, thereby boosting the efficiency of the internal market. We must reject the attempt to stipulate a strict two-year guarantee period, because this provision would weaken consumer protection in many states, as these Member States would have to reduce the guarantee period in their national law, thereby weakening the position of the consumer. The objective of boosting consumer confidence in cross-border purchases, where consumers feel the greatest barriers in terms of language problems, lack of confidence in the payment system and the unwillingness of business to trade across borders, is correct. The criticism from the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who regrets the fact that the bill fails to take account of new products emerging through changes in product development and innovation, for example digital products, is quite correct. In the area of entertainment and consumer electronics, products which include software and other intangible services are becoming increasingly common.</p>

It is these contracts that account for the greatest number of cross-border transactions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also the issue as to whether a given contract is subject to the harmonised rules depends mainly on the wording of the defined terms. Some of these are often deficient and unsatisfactory from a legal perspective.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am anxious to thank Mr Schwab and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. The Commission’s initial proposal was unacceptable because it intended to harmonise fully the rules concerning consumer rights, without systematically bringing them into line with the most favourable national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In other words, many Member States would have had to remove from their national legislation provisions that in fact granted better protection to consumers. In France, two major acquis would have to be abandoned as a result: the ‘latent defect’ rule and the ruling that a doorstep seller is prohibited from collecting payment before the end of the cooling-off period.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However my socialist colleagues and I succeeded in getting this approach altered and in making minimum harmonisation the norm. We also managed to enhance consumer rights on a whole range of points, in particular concerning information that has to be provided by the seller and provisions pertaining to the cooling-off period.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One problem remains however: chapter V.

      <p sl="en">Studies from the Commission show that one in three EU citizens purchase goods online, but only 7% do cross-border online shopping. Thirty-three per cent would be interested in buying cross-border. The field is still unregulated and it is complicated to purchase goods online, especially with regard to delivery and transaction costs. The proposal for a directive on consumer rights aims to reduce the complications for online actions. I very much welcome improved rights for consumers purchasing online. We need to have full information on the traders, with their names, addresses and contact details. The rules across the EU need to be harmonised, so that we do not face unpleasant surprises and extra costs. I welcome the harmonisation of the right of withdrawal within 14 days. We have to protect the consumers, but we also have to boost the economy. I fully support the rapporteur’s efforts to balance this. Implementing the consumers’ rights directive is one aspect of the problem, with full integration and implementation of single digital market, the EU’s internal market and the services directive being another issue. The EU and its Member States have to focus on both.</p>

      <p sl="et">The adoption of the new harmonised European Consumer Rights Directive is certainly one of the more important pillars for a better functioning internal market. The harmonised directive, which brings together a number of directives relating to consumer rights, will considerably simplify the legal framework, help increase consumer confidence and encourage cross-border trade. In order to make trade, or the supply chain, more transparent, especially in e-commerce, we need to ensure that traders’ contact details are available so that the consumer is able to contact them directly if necessary. I therefore support the rapporteur’s proposals to this effect. The directive is quite a balanced one from the point of view of consumers and entrepreneurs, and it is flexible enough to accommodate differences between the Member States. Full consumer protection legislation is still not a reality in the European Union. Nevertheless, this is a big step towards better consumer protection and trade.</p>

This horizontal instrument codifies and clarifies the rights and obligations of consumers and traders throughout the EU. It also indicates that the EU is serious about meeting the needs of the most vulnerable consumers. Existing shortcomings in the field of online or cross-border purchases will largely be eliminated. This will create opportunities, not only for consumers, but also for our SMEs, which will, from now on, find it easier to benefit from the scale advantages of the internal market. However, if we want the best for our SMEs, we should not impose any unnecessary burdens on them. We therefore need to make SME-friendly amendments to the Commission proposal.

Our purchases are increasingly remote and the Internet has now completely changed our habits, partly because our lives have become increasingly frenetic. This is a specific, tangible manifestation of something that textbooks refer to as the ‘global economy’. What is the difference between the Internet and the supermarket? On the Internet you cannot stop to ask the shopkeeper for advice about what there is to choose between one product and another or even go back to the supermarket if there is something wrong with your product and pick up another from the shelf, after showing your receipt to the cashier. That is why the European Consumer Rights Directive is fundamental due to the obligations it imposes over product information and due to the rules it imposes over defective products, which must be replaced, repaired or reduced in price, to ensure that protection for online sales no less strong than that for on-the-spot sales throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, the Consumer Rights Directive is one of the most important legislative texts we will debate in the first half of this year. Better access to information and greater consumer protection are particularly important issues, for example for the development of the online market and for economic growth throughout the EU. The online market is still developing relatively slowly in Europe in comparison with the United States, for example, and my home country – Poland – takes only 17th place among the EU Member States in this regard. Only 23% of Polish consumers make purchases over the Internet, and a lack of confidence appears to be one of the main reasons for this. One of the most controversial points in the proposal for a directive is the extent to which regulations should be harmonised. I am pleased that the rapporteur from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection agreed with the arguments put forward by my group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, criticising the European Commission’s goal of full harmonisation, which would make it impossible in reality for Member States to adopt higher standards than those provided for in the directive.

The director of the company, Mr Flick, has not seen fit to respond to questions from MEPs and simply ignores complaints from the general public. Air Baltic, with its machinations, is trying to make a fool of the European Parliament. It is selling business-class tickets for aircraft on which business-class service is not provided. In parallel, Air Baltic is concealing frequent cases of aircraft malfunctions and thus continues to risk the lives of thousands of passengers.

Hopefully, this will promote cross-border distance sales. We have to remember, however, that there are many other factors that are still hindering the growth in e-commerce in Europe.

I welcome the efforts that have been undertaken with the aim of EU-wide harmonisation of distance selling regulations, which are aimed at protecting consumers and making it easier for traders to operate. What is undoubtedly needed is a compromise which will both guarantee a high level of protection for consumers and make it easier for traders to provide services throughout the EU. I believe that it is right to guarantee a high minimum level of consumer protection throughout the European Union, provided that the Member States will also be able to impose more stringent regulations on their territory if they believe that the level of protection guaranteed by the EU is insufficient. However, we must not ignore the needs of traders, whose lives should genuinely be made easier by the EU-wide harmonisation of regulations, in both operational and cost-reduction terms. It is therefore advisable to formulate a position which will safeguard the interests of both consumers and traders. There can be no question that making transactions safer and harmonising regulations will increase confidence in distance selling, and act as an incentive for consumers to make distance purchases more frequently.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the Conference of Presidents for making time for this debate this week at very short notice. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for coming here at such a late hour to discuss this issue, which is very important for our Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the face of it, this looks like a very technical issue. It is about implementing measures for the Fuel Quality Directive and setting baseline or default values for greenhouse gas emissions for transport fuels. The real, very serious issue is: how serious are we in the European Union about tackling emissions from transport? We know that around 20% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transport. We know that figure is rising, unlike in the housing and energy sectors, where the figure is falling. Cleaning up our transport fuels is a key part of the fight against climate change and that is why the Fuel Quality Directive is so important.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to this question of tar sands and oil shale. Parliament was expecting the Commission’s implementing proposals on the directive at the end of last year. There was a delay and we know the reason for this was because there was an internal debate in the Commission about whether to give a separate value to tar sands. We were told that the reason we could not have the measures was because there was no scientific study to back up the Commission proposal. In early drafts from the Commission, however, we saw there was a separate value for tar sands in the consultation papers, but in a later draft that value had disappeared.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thanks to you, Madam Commissioner, we now have a study on tar sands. That study, which came out two months ago, shows something that other studies have already shown, i.e. that greenhouse gas emissions from Canadian tar sands are on average 107.3g of CO2 per megajoule, compared with 87.1g for conventional fuels. For shale oil it shows a rate of 122 and 139g of CO2 per megajoule. In other words, it shows that these fuels are dirtier than conventional oil. Now we have the studies, I am hoping that we will hear from the Commissioner tonight that we are going to see a proposal to implement the Fuel Quality Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I said at the beginning that this is not just a technical issue. Last week, many MEPs who are here tonight received a petition from thousands of European citizens who are very concerned about this issue. They want what I want, which is proper, fair labelling of tar sands and oil shales. We often hear that the EU is leading the way on climate change, but California has already put in place a low-carbon fuel standard which assesses tar sands as high-carbon.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know there has been a lot of lobbying about this, we have all heard about it, we have met the different lobbyists, and even now that we know that tar sands and oil shale are dirtier than conventional oil, we are now being told ‘no, let us have more studies, let us have more time’. But we have the facts on tar sands now, so I do not see any reason to delay. Tar sands are one of the most polluting ways of producing transport fuel known to man. It follows that they should be given a different categorisation in the Fuel Quality Directive, otherwise there is nothing to stop transport fuels getting dirtier under the Fuel Quality Directive instead of cleaner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Hedegaard, I know you will hear in a moment how many of our colleagues from all groups across the House share our concerns. You are known for your commitment to tackling climate change and are respected for it in this House. We want to work with you to deliver your low-carbon roadmap to actually cut emissions from transport by 60% as you announced last week, so I hope that tonight you are going to come here with some good news for us and tell us that in the next few weeks we will have that implementing standard and we will have a higher value for tar sands and oil shale.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-271-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Connie Hedegaard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have just heard from Linda McAvan that she and the Commission share the same view of how important it is actually to tackle emissions from transport; that is also reflected in the White Paper on transport which will be coming out today. Unfortunately, development of the implementing measure linked to the greenhouse gas intensity reduction target contained in the Fuel Quality Directive has taken longer than anticipated. However, the delay will not affect the ability of suppliers to meet their requirements under the directive, as no Member State has set an intermediate target for 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">In preparing its proposal the Commission has considered that the appropriate legislative approach needs to balance the accuracy and complexity of the reporting method with the degree of variability in the GHG intensities of different fuels. During last autumn and the first weeks of this year, extensive internal discussions have taken place within the Commission which are currently being finalised, and thus a proposal could be discussed with the Member States in the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="en">As concerns the default values for oil sands and oil shale, I am pleased to report that the Commission has recently published reports indicating an average default value for oil sands and a range of indicative default values for oil shales. These reports are available on the Commission’s website. Given the wide interest in this matter the Commission believes that it would be useful to subject these reports to a limited peer review process. In taking this issue forward I have liaised closely with my colleague responsible for trade matters to ensure that our approach is robust in terms of our obligations under international law, and I will continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">So without prejudging the outcome of the peer review process and the subsequent Commission internal consultation, it is the Commission’s intention at this stage to present a draft implementing measure to the relevant regulatory committee that will include default values both for oil sands and for oil shale, as well as for other unconventional fuels such as coal to liquids and gas to liquids.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also foreseen that the draft implementing measure states that the Commission will examine the GHG intensity of other categories of feedstock with high greenhouse gas emissions and, if scientifically warranted, the implementing measure will be amended through the addition of new feedstock categories.</p>
      <p sl="en">This would make the measure non-discriminatory by demonstrating that the list of feedstock categories is open and that the Commission is actively looking at other categories and is ready to extend the list when enough evidence and data is gathered on other categories.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, given that some weeks are necessary for the peer review and subsequently the finalisation of the Commission’s internal discussions, there will be some delay before the draft implementing measure of the whole package can be discussed with the Member States. But as soon as it is approved by the regulatory committee the measure will be transmitted to the European Parliament for scrutiny.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for tabling this question. The revision of the Fuel Quality Directive would not only oblige fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced throughout the life cycle of the fuels, for example during transport and during the refining process, and to measure the reduction, but also to cut the emissions per energy unit by 1% each year from 2011 onwards and by a total of 10% by 2020. However, I believe that it is only possible to measure the reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the fuel if there are corresponding standard values in place. These must finally be identified and made public.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, when Mrs McAvan tabled her question, I had the feeling that she would have preferred to have stopped production in this energy sector. I would like to warn against taking this approach, because the figures and the findings on emissions produced by the extraction of crude oil or of oil from sand or shale vary widely. Only an hour ago, I was speaking to a representative of the chemical industry who said that there is so much potential for technical development that it could be possible to achieve much better results in this area. I would like to remind the House that we are constantly talking about independence from energy sources outside the European Union. This raw material is available to us here in the European Union, so we should include this in our discussions. However, all of this will only work if there are standard values in place which must be checked. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to act quickly.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, we are indeed debating a very crucial issue: emissions from the production of oil from tar sands are three to five times greater than from other production methods and this much-desired indicator that we want in the directive will ensure that we do not subsidise this catastrophic production method.</p>
      <p sl="el">You said that the study has been completed. However, although we have a study, because we said that we needed a study in order to proceed, we now want to subject this study to peer review. The question, Commissioner, is when will this procedure be completed? What are the timelines? How much longer do we need to wait until this indicator has been reviewed, using this methodology, so that we can, at long last, include it in our legislation?</p>
      <p sl="el">In fact, the problem with tar sands is not just the emissions. It is the destruction of unique forests, the Canadian arctic forests, our vital allies against climate change. At the same time, we are destroying the native land in which this massive destruction is taking place and, if we do not include the indicator in our legislation, this destruction will spread to other countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Hedegaard for her long-standing efforts on this issue and for her positive announcement this evening. Commissioner, you have met MEPs on a number of occasions and we appreciate that the stumbling block has not been of your making. Nevertheless the lack of progress has been deeply frustrating.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all we were told it was not enough that there were a dozen studies that all showed that tar sands had higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil. We were told that there had to be a study using exactly the same methodology. Now that we have that study from the Joint Research Centre – and it shows the value of 107g per megajoule, way above the 87.1g average for crude oil – opponents are saying that we need a peer review. It really does feel like timewasting on a grand scale.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a pity that the lobbying against a separate value for tar sands has come so heavily from one quarter, because it is absolutely not about discriminating against Canada. There are many other potential tar sand sites, some of them, as we heard just now, within the EU itself. The fact that these alternative sources of oil are attracting investment interest across the globe is precisely why we must insist on a separate greenhouse gas value for them. Otherwise, as tar sands creep up as an increasingly large part of the energy mix, we will find ourselves in the situation where we are complying with the Fuel Quality Directive’s 6% reduction target on paper, but in real life we are producing fuel with even higher emissions than today.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would be very helpful, Commissioner, if you could explain to DG Trade, as I am sure you have, that this is not an attack on Canada, and that apart from anything else, Parliament would want this issue of the default tar sands value to be sorted out in order to ensure a smooth passage for the EU-Canada trade agreement.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the climate package, we decided that the carbon footprint of transport fuel should decrease by 6% by 2020. It would be completely inconsistent and senseless if we now turned a blind eye to the dirtiest fuels of all, like oil from oil sand, at the same time encouraging their production around the world, in Canada and Africa, for example. It is quite obvious that we should have our own default values for the carbon footprint of oil from oil sand and oil shale. We also need to differentiate the other sources of crude oil as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In my view, the Canadian Government has very inappropriately put pressure on the EU, and we should not give way to it. If Canada’s footprint from tar sands oil is lower than the reference value, Canada can prove it. Should we not adhere to the same principle with fossil oil as we do with biofuels, which is that the default values are differentiated according to the source of the raw materials?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, global reserves of bituminous sands are very extensive. It is estimated that reserves of bituminous oil are over double the size of reserves of crude oil extracted using conventional methods. Present-day technologies make it possible to exploit deposits of raw materials in places where no one would previously have supposed it to be possible. At the same time, however, environmental protection requirements have become more stringent, and so there is a clash between environmental standards and the pursuit of raw materials and the desire to extract them at any cost. This results in land degradation, deforestation and the exploitation of water resources.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Extracting companies must be forced to recultivate the land they have used, to make it possible for forests to grow there again one day. Companies which make profits from the processing of bituminous sands must allocate some of these profits to environmental protection, for example in the form of a deposit. The European Commission should support such requirements and technologies for reducing CO2 emissions. After all, Europe and Canada have such strong economic links that Canadian industry, whether it wants to or not, must adapt to European environmental protection requirements in order to operate on the European market, for example in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for taking the initiative in this case and Mrs Hedegaard for addressing the problem. We are not happy about the speed at which things are happening, but we know that this matter is in good hands with Mrs Hedegaard. We would like to support her during the discussions within the Commission and with everyone else involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">The environmental impact of tar sands is clear. There is an exhibition outside Parliament which makes it clear that, although we may question some of what is said or some of the figures, we have a serious environmental problem on our hands. This is indisputable. Given that we have discussed the effects of biofuels in such detail and even planned to carry out indirect investigations of movements in food cultivation, we must look at this problem, which is so obvious, much more closely. For this reason, this is an important initiative.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the debate and during the preparations, I had a sentence running through my head which has been said repeatedly by the German Environment Minister, Norbert Röttgen: We have already picked the low-hanging fruit when it comes to fossil fuels. This becomes clear in the context of this subject and in the light of the exhibition outside Parliament. Extracting all our additional deposits of fossil fuels will involve a huge amount of work and give rise to new problems. Therefore, I would like to point out once again this evening that we all have cause to think more carefully about energy efficiency, especially given the events of recent days. I would like us to exert greater pressure on the Commission and on Mr Oettinger to follow up the 20% target for energy efficiency. I hope that the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport and the Transport Commissioner will be able to come up with specific measures rather than just empty words over the next few years and that they will not wait to do so until the next parliamentary term.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in the square outside our Parliament there is a photographic exhibition on the tar sands in Canada. One of the photographs really chills you to the bone. You see beautiful virgin forests and then a sharp line which marks the beginning of a polluted black oily lake measuring 170 sq. metres. This really chills you to the very bone and I would recommend that everyone goes and sees the exhibition this evening.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Apart from leading to a huge loss of biodiversity, tar sand oil also emits extremely high levels of CO2 . As far as I am concerned, biodiversity and CO2 emissions alone are sufficient reasons for us to vigorously oppose the exploitation of the tar sands in Canada, as well as in other countries. However, the least we can do is to include the polluting value of tar sand oil in the Fuel Quality Directive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Having listened to what Mrs Hedegaard said, I assume that will happen, but I hope that she will also more vehemently oppose the exploitation of the tar sands in Canada and in other parts of the world.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, significant results can be achieved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 if investments are made in measures for increasing energy efficiency in buildings and the transport sector.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We had wide-ranging debates at the time when the Fuel Quality Directive was adopted. The car manufacturing industry thought then that, in order to increase the share of fuel deriving from biofuels, it needed a longer period for designing and manufacturing new engines capable of coping with increased vapour pressure.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, the directive’s final text makes it compulsory for both car manufacturers and fuel producers to invest in reducing polluting emissions and improving fuel quality.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that, in order to reduce the polluting emissions produced by the transport sector, the European Union should invest as a priority in developing a pan-European smart electricity grid which is capable of receiving energy produced locally and regionally from renewable energy sources and will be integrated into the infrastructure required for using electric vehicles.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, I must say that this directive gives rise to serious concerns among the oil processing companies of Central and Eastern Europe. This is not even because it has yet to come into effect, but rather because we are curious as to the methods by which emissions will be calculated. Will it be the ‘fixed’ method, which is based on an EU average, or the ‘hybrid’ method, which will calculate emissions from the time and place of extraction? If it is the latter, producers working with Russian oil would actually have to reduce their GHG emissions by 12%, since pollution is already high at the site of extraction.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Commissioner, I sent you a letter in this regard in January, together with four of my colleagues, and we have received your reply, but that reply has not dispelled our doubts fully. I would therefore like to ask you to reassure me, if possible, that this law will not put oil processing companies that process Russian petrol at a disadvantage, and will consequently not put Central and Eastern European Member States in a discriminative situation.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The Commission brought out a very good document on energy efficiency a few weeks ago. It pointed out the need for more work to be done on buildings and transport and I agree 100% on that.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Regarding transport, much more needs to be done in putting strictures on those who produce vehicles to come up with more fuel-efficient vehicles. That is a very important point and not enough has been done on that. I am a member of the Delegation for Relations with Canada, and the Canadians made a presentation to us yesterday about this matter.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Parliament for the very clear message it has given here tonight. I think it is very clear – including the impatience and sense of urgency. Mr Schnellhardt said that we should act promptly and Mr Arsenis asked particularly, with regard to the timetable: when will this end? I am happy to say that we are talking about a rather short time now. There is the peer review where we are talking about weeks, then it has to come back after that to the Commission, and there will then be the internal process. It will not end there but at least we will start to get it through to the next stage which is with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we are coming close but, as Mrs Hall was saying, this is absolutely not a discriminatory initiative, and I think you all understand why it makes sense to take care that its documentation is robust. That is what we have provided and we all know what the reasons are. One of the reasons is that it was not included from the very outset when this case started several years back. Now we are doing this work and so we can bring it to an end.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish by saying that, when it comes to this default value for tar sands the overall delay in the implementation of the directive means that we could get the default value included now in the same sort of round as when we are implementing the directive as such. In that sense, when it comes to the default value for tar sands, we will be able to do it a bit quicker than some of us thought possible when we started this nine months ago. Thank you for the very clear message. As I hope you realise, we are working very hard to bring this to an end.</p>

      <p sl="en">Having visited the oil sands in Canada last year, I am an eyewitness of this phenomenon. I had the opportunity to engage in extensive consultations with the Albertan Government and the Federal Government in Canada regarding this issue.

I received answers to all of these questions from the Albertan Minister for International Relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was conveyed to me that Canada is fully committed to reducing global GHG emissions and de-carbonising fossil fuels, and has pointed out that studies show that the GHG intensity of oil from tar sands can be equal to or less than some other fuels. On the other hand there are remaining concerns about public health, biodiversity and local wildlife.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would encourage the Commission to send an expert group to visit the oil sands in Canada to conduct an independent analysis of the oil sands, as it will be proposing amendments to the Fuel Quality Directive before December 2012, with a possibility of introducing additional measures for suppliers to reduce by 2% the lifecycle GHG per unit of energy.</p>

      <p sl="en">A struggle has been going on in Canada for many years between nature conservationists and investors, who are unfortunately showing ever less regard for the protection of nature as global prices and demand for oil rise. The supra-national oil companies regard environmental protection merely as an expense item that must be reduced. Their disregard does not even stop at the de facto genocide of local populations that depend on the environment for their livelihood. The alarming growth in numbers of cancer sufferers among local populations is a direct result of reckless extraction. We have become used to valuing everything in terms of money. In the global variant of the board game Monopoly which we call economics, we see only the short-term profit. We take no account of what we will ultimately pay for the further deforestation of the temperate zone and the grassing over of whole ecosystems in a much longer and more serious game of survival. Under the current economic and political circumstances, resources will simply be exhausted, and the anticipated damage to the environment will occur. The profits are too tempting, and the thirst for energy is too great. Who will decide? The people and their democratically-elected representatives, or the money men and managers of oil companies? Unless Europe takes a firm stand over the unsustainable extraction of tar sands and oil shales, then we are merely engaging in political theatre, which shows we are interested in the issue, while in reality we have neither the will nor the power to change the situation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an important aspect of international trade policy very late in the day. Given its importance, I would have preferred the House to be full, with all the seats occupied. The European Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a major achievement of European trade policy. It opens up our market to the poorest countries in the world for all types of goods except arms. It also gives developing countries trade concessions on a whole range of products. GSP+ is a valuable incentive system which offers developing countries further concessions if they sign and put into practice important international agreements on human rights, labour standards and protecting the environment. However, the system does have weak points and it needs to be updated regularly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over the years, the European Parliament, partner countries, companies and non-governmental organisations have made important suggestions for improving the system. The whole world is now waiting for the Commission to issue its proposal on the much-needed revision of the system. The deadline for this proposal was 1 June 2010. The Commission has not delivered on time and its failure to do so has left the countries involved and companies both inside and outside the EU in a dangerous state of uncertainty. The existing regulation must now be revised.</p>
      <p sl="de">You are attempting to rescue the situation by means of a transitional regulation and this is what we will be voting on tomorrow, that is on Thursday. The transitional regulation is simply an extension. It does not change anything, it does not improve anything and it does not implement the new requirements resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. This has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the European Parliament and, as the rapporteur, I have felt the same. It is the obligation of the Members of this Parliament to ensure that the rights, the duties and also the powers granted to the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe by the Treaty of Lisbon are respected. It is also our obligation to make sure that the reduction in tariffs brings about a genuine improvement in the situation of the developing countries. In order to protect the EU’s partners from the consequences of a long-drawn-out procedure, I suggested initially to the Committee on International Trade that only those elements of the regulation should be amended which are necessary to allow Parliament to fulfil its new role.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, I would like to emphasise that I also believe a general redrafting of the GSP and GSP+ schemes is needed. During the intensive meetings with the Council and the Commission on the legal issues resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon which affect the transitional regulation, Parliament finally decided to take a big leap of faith. At this point, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to the chair of the Committee on International Trade, Professor Moreira, for his untiring efforts as mediator and also to you, Mr De Gucht, for the Commission’s assurance that key amendments, in particular with regard to informing and involving Parliament, would be addressed in practice. Therefore, we decided to drop all our amendments, in order to enable the transitional regulation to come into force as quickly as possible. We did this primarily in the interests of our partners and of the companies which are affected.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s assurance includes a promise in future to inform the European Parliament in full, immediately and at the same time as the Council about work relating to essential aspects of the GSP and about all developments and to share all documents relating to the GSP. The Commission also guarantees that the European Parliament will be notified about any suspension of preferences, in accordance with Article 16(3), about withdrawals, including the corresponding investigation reports from the Commission, in accordance with Article 17, and about safeguard decisions, in accordance with Articles 20 and 21, before they come into force.</p>
      <p sl="de">We welcome the tabling of Omnibus 1 and the Commission’s readiness to enter into an in-depth discussion of the proposals which it has made in Omnibus 1. At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that Omnibus 2 must be tabled urgently.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament has made a concession on the transitional regulation. We must not forget that we need to fight for the ongoing and fundamental implementation of Parliament’s parliamentary rights.</p>

Ever since the Commission presented its proposal to extend, for a limited period of time, the application of the current GSP regulation – the so-called roll-over proposal – the Council has been consistently reiterating before this House the importance of adopting this proposal in good time. This is to ensure that developing and less developed countries will continue to benefit from the EU’s general system of preferences, which is a fundamental element of the EU’s trade policy towards developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Council is glad to see that the first step towards the adoption of this proposal at first reading is taking place today here in the European Parliament. We will take the necessary steps as quickly as possible to confirm the agreement between our institutions on the basis of your position adopted today. At the same time, the Council is looking forward to the forthcoming presentation by the Commission of its proposal for the comprehensive review of the EU’s GSP.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We should tailor the scheme to better help those developing economies which most need the preferences, and ensure that it becomes an even more efficient development and foreign policy tool by providing incentives for good governance. With that in mind, the Council expresses its readiness to work together with Parliament in a spirit of good cooperation with a view to putting in place a modern, comprehensive and fully functional legal framework which will be conducive to developing countries’ needs.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let me conclude by taking this opportunity to fully acknowledge, on behalf of the Presidency, the positive and constructive efforts by both the Chair of the INTA Committee, Mr Moreira, and the rapporteur for this dossier, Mr Scholz, to reach an agreement on this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I warmly acknowledge the support within the Committee on International Trade for the proposal on the extension of the regulation applying the scheme of generalised tariff preferences. Our particular thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Scholz and to the Chair of the INTA committee, Mr Moreira, for their willingness to find a pragmatic solution on how to address Parliament’s concerns on the application to the existing GSP regulation of the new rules on delegated and implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will remember that the extension was proposed as a means to bridge the period necessary to adjust to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and to submit a new regulation on the future EU GSP scheme. The European Parliament’s support as expressed in the INTA Committee’s vote on 3 March paves the way for successful continuity of the current scheme to the benefit of developing countries and the EU. It also reinforces the EU’s role and commitment to the objectives of EU development policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has heard Parliament’s concerns on the decision-making aspects of the GSP regulation loud and clear. In this regard, we can reconfirm our full and active support for the European Parliament to play its role in relation to trade policy as foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty. For this reason, the Commission is committed to discussing in a constructive spirit Parliament’s concern as expressed over the last few weeks. This discussion will continue in the context of the two Commission proposals for a regulation adjusting decision-making in the field of trade policy in the light of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty – Omnibus I and Omnibus II.</p>
      <p sl="en">In parallel, the Commission will make every effort to act on Parliament’s request to be kept fully informed about work related to essential aspects of GSP. This is indeed crucial in order for Parliament to be able play its role in trade policy effectively. For this reason, the Commission, building on existing requirements, will inform Parliament and the Council immediately of all important developments and share all GSP-relevant documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally we are looking forward to further discussions with you on the future scheme of generalised preferences further to the proposal for a new regulation which will come your way in May. I stand ready to discuss the main elements of the proposal at the earliest opportunity after it is adopted by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I am very pleased that the rapporteur’s willingness to compromise made the timely extension of the scheme of tariff preferences possible. The Hungarian Presidency of the European Council played a very important part in this process. Failure to extend the scheme of tariff preferences now would have an extremely adverse effect on the poorest countries of the world. It is regrettable, however, that the European Commission submitted this proposal to Parliament late, and we could not have a meaningful debate here, even though the GSP Regulation would deserve an amendment. That is because the tariff preferences we are granting to the richest oil exporting countries of the world, such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, are unjustifiable. It is worth considering whether Russia, which is not a member of the WTO because it did not wish to join it, and very often uses commercial policy to exert foreign policy pressure, is worthy of receiving commercial preferences.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is also worth considering how we could integrate sustainability criteria into the scheme of tariff preferences. After all, today commercial preferences are also granted to countries which otherwise hinder the adoption of climate protection agreements on the international scene or, for that matter, export to the European Union goods produced in an unsustainable manner, often through the destruction of rainforests or tremendous CO2 emissions. I believe that the next tariff preference scheme will have to address these issues as well.</p>

    <intervention id="3-294-000" speaker_id="96930" name="Vital Moreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, if we are here debating how long the current scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) will be in force, it is because the Commission has failed in its obligation to table the proposed substantive revision of this scheme within the proper timeframe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore a rollover period for the current regulation is expected in order to maintain the benefits of international trade enjoyed by developing countries, starting with the poorest, when accessing the European market. It is crucial that this proposal be adopted without further delay, in order for countries benefitting from the GSP to continue to benefit from it, and for the economic players that will, in this way, be able to develop their trade relations with the necessary predictability and legal security.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I, as Chair of the Committee on International Trade and as shadow rapporteur, have advocated that the rollover should be a rollover and nothing more, with even the European Parliament giving up on an ad hoc adaptation of this regulation to the Commission’s implementing acts, and giving us faith that it will be brought into line in the near future, using the so-called ‘omnibus’ regulations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to stress that, based on this understanding, the decision taken by the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the remaining members of the committee, influenced the European Commission's commitment - which was today reiterated by Commissioner De Gucht and I sincerely thank him for his care - to henceforth guarantee the European Parliament that there will be timely and complete information about every relevant act relating to the application of the current regulation, in line with the Treaty of Lisbon's provisions regarding the common commercial policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One final word to thank the rapporteur, to thank the Commission and also to thank the Council for this compromise, which will enable Parliament to properly look after the interests of Europe and of those who rely on us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the few methods of differentiation that works in favour of developing countries in international trade. It is a delicate instrument that must be used in the best way.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tonight we are talking about an extension, which means that the Commission date will be postponed once the new final proposal has been submitted. In the meantime, however, we are saying that this is a tool to be handled with caution, and that also applies to inter-institutional relations. Until now, even on the basis of the pre-Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has not always been fully involved in decisions, as happened at the time of the discussions on Colombia or Sri Lanka that fired the enthusiasm of this House.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must also consider the merits of an ex-post evaluation of the decision to implement the regulation. What is the impact of the effects of a tariff reduction, what about its suspension, what are its mechanisms, what is its procedure? Sometimes an on-the-spot examination of these issues may reveal surprises and suggest the most relevant criteria to make the impact of the regulation as effective as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as the conditions are concerned, the world is changing and the instrument must show greater compliance with regard to those countries rewarded by the tariff concessions. The main concept of respect for human rights must be complemented by a broader vision in which, as noted by the rapporteur Mr Scholz – whom I thank for the excellent work he has done in this report – various indicators are taken into consideration: post-conflict rehabilitation, the specific situation of women, trade unions, the situation of recovery after natural disasters, environmental sustainability and compliance with international social agreements.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we were to adopt a combination of these criteria, I would not be surprised if the list of beneficiary countries we came up with were different from the current list and perhaps more deserving, but we will be able to talk about this again once we have the final proposal for a regulation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, given that the current scheme of generalised tariff preferences expires at the end of the year, it is important, as has already been said, for the Commission to table its new draft of the comprehensive revision of the system on time.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Now we are only just discussing the extension necessary to ensure legal certainty and guarantee mutual interests. However, the importance of this subject whether for developing countries or also EU Member States, above all for those with weaker economies whose industrial, agricultural or social interests are not always taken into consideration in the international trade agreements promoted by the Commission, makes a detailed discussion necessary in order to take account of all the potential aspects, consequences and impacts of this system on a future regulation, the draft of which must reach Parliament as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure concerns the Generalised System of Preferences, in other words reductions on import duties for third countries which take on certain commitments to international treaties or agreements on sensitive issues such as employment rights and the environment. These requirements should be periodically reviewed and updated on the proposal of the European Commission, but unfortunately we are not here to vote for a revision but an extension of the old rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">At this sensitive time of not only economic but also political international crisis, not to revise and update the conditions for access to or exclusion from the list is a choice that goes against the best interests of the European Union. Despite the non-linear behaviour of the European Commission, we will still nevertheless vote in favour, because we believe in this tool favouring third countries that particularly distinguish themselves compared with others over issues considered to be strategic.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I listened to the interventions. I understand that the groups agree that we should extend the existing system, but that they are waiting to have the new system on their desks as soon as possible. That is what we will do. We are working on it. As you know, before you can make a legislative proposal you need a public consultation, which takes time. You need an impact assessment, which takes time. Then, of course, you also have the internal decision-making process within the European Commission, on a subject which is far-reaching.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is about a financial system which will apply for quite a period of time. We want the system to be much more selective than it was in the past, so that we can help those who really need it. At this moment in time, more than 150 countries are beneficiaries of the system. It is not at all selective. You could even ask yourself what the use of such a system is. We are thoroughly reviewing it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will come forward with our proposals within a couple of months. Parliament will then have the possibility to discuss them with us thoroughly. I would also like to repeat our pledge that we will keep Parliament fully informed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the reform of the GSP will be a focal point for the Council and for the Presidency. With the review of the current scheme, which is to start under our Presidency, Parliament and the Council will have a unique opportunity to reflect the profound changes in the global economy, particularly the vastly increased competitiveness of emerging partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency took careful note of the valid concerns emphasised by Mr Rinaldi on the effective implementation of the GSP. The Council is looking forward to considering that issue and many others on the basis of the Commission’s forthcoming proposal for the new GSP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me emphasise once again how grateful I am to the rapporteur and to the Committee Chair, Mr Moreira, for their cooperation. I think this is a victory for common sense, because they understood that it was an urgent and important issue. We really did not want to create any legal problems. For me this is a kind of model and I very much hope that, on other issues on which we have such legal disputes, this will serve as a very good example of smooth relations between the Council and Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for working together so constructively. Now that we have finally agreed on the formal aspects of the transitional regulation, I would like to make use of this debate to explain briefly some of the requirements for the future regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new version of the regulation should have the following basic objectives: 1. To increase the efficiency of the system; 2. To develop rules that will provide for a better regulated reform process in which the involvement of the beneficiaries is guaranteed; 3. To ensure that the regulation gives due weight to the task of democratic control which Parliament is required to perform. This includes proposals from the Committee on Development.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) should be a clearer and more transparent system. I would like to make three points in this respect and the first concerns the rules of origin. The rules of origin and the administrative procedures that accompany them are one of the main reasons why the trade preferences granted by the GSP are being underused, particularly by the least developed countries. In the current version of the system, the rules of origin often prevent preferences that exist on paper from having a positive impact. I have just come back from the Parliamentary Conference on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva and this problem was very high up on the list of issues discussed there. In my opinion, the EU should campaign within the WTO for the preference system to be given priority as part of its work on harmonising the rules of origin.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the partner countries. Here I feel that it is particularly important for us to develop more straightforward criteria. The Gini coefficient is a good example of this type of criterion. As already mentioned, we need to be more flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is about technical assistance. Preferences alone are not enough. We need to increase the impact of the system and improve the rate of utilisation of the GSP by providing technical assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is all about a general improvement of the preference system as a whole. I would like to thank everyone involved once again for their constructive approach. I will be happy to continue working with the Commission on the basis of today’s assurances.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to stress that the proposal tabled by the European Commission is not the reform of the ‘Generalised System of Preferences’ requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 5 June 2008, but merely an extension of the current set of rules. This is why I share the rapporteur’s view about the need to review this regulation devised in 2008 immediately, and to adapt it to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, which subsequently came into force. Thanks to this treaty, the European Parliament enjoys new powers in the area of trade and must have its say on the eligibility criteria, the list of beneficiary countries and the temporary withdrawal of GSP arrangements. A general review of the regulation will need to be carried out in the future, aimed at increasing the involvement of beneficiary countries in the reform processes which affect them, granting technical assistance to help develop their institutional capacity, as well as reviewing and harmonising the rules of origin.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) gives 176 developing countries preferential access to the EU market. Tariff reductions or duty-free access to the internal market enable trade to make a contribution to reducing poverty in these countries. Therefore, I support the transitional regulation which ensures the legal continuity of the GSP, so that this opportunity remains available to developing countries. Trade is also an important and efficient tool which gives the countries affected the chance to move closer towards the rule of law and democracy and to develop a well-functioning economy. Given the importance and the urgency of this issue, I am in favour of an extension and of making rapid progress with the regulation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, there has been much discussion in this Parliament recently about the inadequate operation of the food supply chain in Europe and a report has even been approved on this subject. I will give you some examples published today in Romania of the customs prices for intra-Community imports, compared with their prices on the store shelf.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Potatoes are imported at an average price of 15 eurocents per kilogram and reach the store shelf at 80 cents per kilogram. Sugar is purchased for 50 eurocents and reaches the store shelf at EUR 1.15. Poultry meat is purchased at EUR 1.25 and sold in stores at an average price of EUR 2.10 per kilogram.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union’s common agricultural policy must respond to these challenges, not to mention guarantee food security, as a global strategic problem.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The growth in population size creates the need for a larger volume of food, but we have an ever-growing shortage, based on the available supply. Since the right to food is a basic right, food security is and must remain one of the European Union’s priorities. The strategies implemented as part of the common agricultural policy must be backed up by an appropriate budget which will meet these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the budget allocated to the common agricultural policy must remain at least at its current level or even be adapted to accommodate the new increased needs resulting from these natural disasters, which have no respect for borders or nationality, but only perhaps for geographical area.</p>

Around 300 000 workers took part in the demonstration, organised by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP). It was a sea of people, indignation and revolt that flooded the streets of Lisbon, coming from all corners of Portugal. It was a national response of organised struggle, demonstrating that workers, women, young people and retired people are tired of being the victims of policies dictated by the interests of large, national and European economic and financial groups.</p>

However, no one, neither trade unions nor employers, has asked for this amendment to be made to the old code. They even disagree with the new measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The reality is that the Labour Code promoted by the government is not aimed at introducing flexibility, but at strongly politicising the public sector and striking a hard blow against employees through provisions such as getting rid of collective labour agreements and trade unions’ rights, as well as making collective redundancies without any compensation payments. This means that the government is victimising the very people who are working and supporting, through their work, the desperate efforts to overcome the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="bg">However, the criteria must be clear and apply to all, and not get confused with abstract, moralistic criteria or become politicised. For instance, the levels of corruption must be monitored for candidate countries.</p>

A great deal of precision is required.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I therefore cannot understand how there can be people in Europe today constructing memorials to fascist criminals. On 14 March, a community club of some kind in Košice unveiled a bust of János Esterházy – a war criminal condemned to death in 1947 for collaborating with fascism. They unveiled a bust of a criminal who welcomed the fascist troops invading Košice. He openly proclaimed collaboration with the Nazis, declaring, and I quote: ‘I have had anti-Jewish beliefs from a very young age, and I will have them to my dying day.’</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, this blatant provocation is, in my view, all the more unfortunate for the fact that this celebration of a military war criminal included a speech from the Hungarian consul – a diplomat of the country now holding the Presidency and speaking in many forums on behalf of all of us, and also on behalf of the entire EU.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the floor so that I can draw your attention to a complex problem which unfortunately affects every single Bulgarian citizen, namely, the daily racketeering which the banks engage in against consumers.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It is ridiculous that some banks in Bulgaria make charges when money is both deposited and withdrawn. I recently fell victim to the insane pressure exerted by banks and had funds illegally frozen in my account. It transpired with this incident that I did not have any legal grounds for making a protest.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Legislation is not strictly regulated. Due to strong lobbying from the banking sector or the weak show of political will, it turns out that the government does not get involved in the bilateral contract between the customer and bank. Everyone can also clearly see the lack of equality between the partners in this contract.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The problem, as far as I see it, is that competition has not created acceptable market conditions and I think that the government needs to get involved. I call for the quicker introduction of SEPA and for creating a clear framework for controlling the banks. I hope that the banks will then pay more attention to their customers and look after them better because, at the moment, they are simply a daily target for racketeering.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we were discussing consumer rights earlier on. One right which EU consumers are entitled to is that of food security and safety. They expect food coming into the European Union to be produced according to the same high standards as food produced internally. Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed. No lesser authority than the European Court of Auditors said recently that ‘certain standards, mainly on animal welfare, imposed on EU farmers cannot be imposed on producers of imported meat’. That is a damning indictment, especially as it also points out that as little as 2% of food coming in can actually be tested, in marked contrast to the situation within Europe where every animal is traceable from farm to fork.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of that, it seems foolhardy to be pursuing a Mercosur agreement, especially as the Swedish Institute for Food and Technology pointed out that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef can be 35 times higher than that of Irish beef.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, many experts are saying that the next crisis could be an energy crisis and that, moreover, we are not doing what is necessary to prevent it or that we are not doing it fast enough to prevent it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The World Wide Fund for Nature is calling for all of us to make a small gesture toward sustainability this Saturday. Many Europeans will turn out their lights for an hour and many public administrations too. That is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe cannot remain dependent on energy sources that do not belong to it and are far away, or on unsecure energy sources. We must help the Member States to build an energy model in which renewable energy sources are the heart of the new mix.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must also help to raise awareness of new patterns of consumption because, without any doubt, renewable energy and efficiency are the keys to future sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I should like to call on all the Member States of the Union to join the call, the desire of five Member States – including Spain – to reduce CO2 emissions by a further 30%. That way we would demonstrate that Europe, as well as being a leader in terms of freedom and rights, is also a leader in terms of its commitment to the planet’s sustainability.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am sorry to inform you at this late hour that this afternoon a group of Estonian cyclists were kidnapped by armed men in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The Estonians had crossed into Lebanon from Syria earlier in the day and were intercepted at about 17.30 by armed men in three vehicles with no licence plates. There is no information at the moment as to who kidnapped the cyclists or whether the incident was politically motivated. However, the Bekaa Valley is a stronghold of the Islamist Hezbollah movement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to plead with Baroness Ashton, despite her constant and necessary involvement in Libya, to help resolve the situation. It is a challenge for the established European External Action Service to provide for smaller Member States to help the citizens of the EU in distressing situations such as this.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are currently 30 million blind and visually impaired people living in Europe. Have you ever thought about how they must face unresolved situations even while on a common shopping errand? In many cases they are unable to determine the nature of a product by holding a simple box or bottle in their hands. If they take it off the shelf, they do not know what they are holding in their hands, even though without a doubt they, too, have the right to lead independent and safe lives.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Therefore together with five of my fellow Members from four groups I would like to encourage you to urge manufacturers of industrial products to affix Braille labels to their containers on a voluntary basis. I would also like to ask my fellow Members to support with their signatures Declaration 14/2011, which deals with this issue.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, in rivalries, the parties involved have always found people to blame, whom they declared responsible for the injuries suffered. I would like to draw your attention to one such case. Count János Esterházy was interned at the end of World War II, first by the Nazis and then, during the communist occupation, by the Soviets as well. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia he is still regarded as a war criminal, while, Mr Paška, the Russian Supreme Court already annulled his sentence in 1993, and the Polish head of state awarded him the prestigious Polonia Restituta Order two years ago on this very day.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Esterházy assisted in the escape of hundreds of Jews, Czechs, Slovaks and Poles, and he was the only member of the Slovak parliament, Mr Paška, who voted and raised his voice against the anti-Jewish laws in 1942. The joint building of a united Europe could begin after the ruins of World War II had been cleaned up, which included the rehabilitation of personages such as Esterházy. It is up to us to clean up the remaining ruins.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in order to say that a given country meets the requirements for a mature democracy, it is not enough to say that elections to representative bodies, including and in particular the parliament, are held there in line with the principles of universality, secrecy, equality and fairness. It is also essential to be able to say that the rights of minorities are respected in the country. I think that the Chamber in which we are holding our debates today is the most appropriate place to remind Members of the fact that on 17 March the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania amended its Education Act. In its amended form, the Act unfortunately appears to use administrative methods to violate the rights of minorities, including the Polish minority in this instance, by endeavouring to assimilate people who belong to the Polish minority under duress which is, as it were, imposed by the state.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Suffice it to say that the Education Act means an identical teaching programme will be imposed on all schools, including those where the only pupils are those from national minorities. It increases the number of compulsory subjects taught in Lithuanian. Under the pretext of ‘optimisation of the school network’, national minority schools, including Polish schools, are to be closed in small towns, and only Lithuanian schools are to remain there. The Act violates international conventions ratified by Lithuania.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worth noting that various individuals have spoken about this matter many times. I think that the European Parliament is the appropriate forum to speak out about such matters, and to call for the fundamental rights of national minorities to be respected.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0042/2011) by Mr Baudis, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (2010/2233(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-326-000" speaker_id="1759" name="Dominique Baudis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all I should like to stress that this report is the outcome of very constructive work with the political groups and I wish personally to thank Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels and Mrs Brantner, as well as Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for their collaboration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, this report relates to the overall strategy in relations between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our work started several months ago, so before the events that are now taking place in the Arab world. Since then, we have observed everywhere – including in the Gulf – powerful demonstrations, which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, right at the beginning of our work, even before the events began, the report – and the amendments adopted in committee – raised all the issues that are behind the uprising. We condemn all forms of discrimination – including those founded on gender or religion – we highlight the issues relating to labour law, social and trade union rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and of opinion, women's rights, the need to reform the justice system, the abolition of the death penalty and of mutilating sentences, and political rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the events in Bahrain have unfolded, and faced with the repression of demonstrations, as well as the military intervention of neighbouring countries, members of the GCC, we have prepared, with the shadow rapporteurs, a series of oral amendments that offer support to the demonstrators fighting for freedom. We have highlighted the legitimacy of their demands and condemned the violent reaction by the Bahraini authorities as well as the military intervention of GCC countries that came to take part in the repression, and we express our grave concern in respect of the violent response of those in power. Finally we offer our full support to the process of democratic transition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, this report also outlines long-term strategic prospects. It touches on the potential of a partnership in many areas (geopolitics, energy, education and science and in the area of regional integration).</p>
      <p sl="fr">From a geopolitical point of view, Iran clearly represents a genuine threat. Between Iran and Israel, the Gulf States would inevitably be the collateral victims of a conflict. These countries expect a lot from us in trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The GCC countries, which make up a quarter of Arab League member states, play a very important role in the peace process. Let us remember that they are behind the Arab peace initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to energy, the GCC is the European Union’s leading oil supplier, so the EU is highly dependent on these countries, but their oil reserves are dwindling and they are preparing their transition thanks to the development of renewable energy. We can offer our experience in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On an educational and scientific level, these countries are making education one of their priorities. Because of the limited number of universities and lecturers, we are seeing units of prestigious American universities being set up. Unfortunately, the European Union, although committed, is very much lagging behind the United States. For example, only eight students from GCC countries came to Europe last year as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in the area of regional integration, the GCC is slow to make progress. Wiser for its experience, the European Union can offer its help, advice and know-how; finally, we call for the signing of a free trade agreement which has been in negotiation for over 20 years.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the states of the Persian Gulf have significant economic potential, offering broad possibilities for greater cooperation with the EU. The Gulf Cooperation Council, just like the European Union, has a serious interest in improving commercial cooperation, which therefore depends on our ability to communicate cooperation priorities to Gulf state representatives.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Our views are close on many issues regarding the economic management of international security or the fight against terrorism, and it would therefore be a pity to limit potential cooperation only to the commercial and economic sphere. It is surely clear to us all that our current cooperation with the Gulf states has considerable potential for growth, and the drafting of a new, more ambitious plan for EU policy in the Gulf Cooperation Council and its member states might, along with trade improvements from economic cooperation, also bring a closer partnership with representatives of the moderate Islamic world, which, in difficult times, might be a worthwhile interesting political bonus from this activity.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, personally, I too am in favour of a free trade agreement coming into effect between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The region could become an important strategic partner for the European Union with regard to commerce, including an increased oil supply. I believe it is essential that we strengthen economic relations. In order to ensure the competitiveness of the European Union, we must find additional new markets and new partners, whereas in areas where the European Union already plays a substantial part, our priority is the official reinforcement of relations. The successful conclusion of the negotiation process which has been going on for twenty years requires a constructive yet flexible approach from both parties, so that the current, rather rigid positions can be approximated. If we seriously believe that the European Union must be able to compete with the United States, China and India, it is essential that we also penetrate various economic areas and market segments where other major powers may already have seized predominance, and that we focus on our existing market priorities and increase their importance.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, first of all, I too would like to congratulate Mr Baudis for this report. Parliament therefore supports the resumption of negotiations between the EU and Gulf Cooperation Council at a critical time.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The events in Bahrain indicate that political dialogue between both international organisations needs to be stepped up. Indeed, I think that the six Arab states can initiate peaceful change in society by improving the human rights situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, the EU’s oil supply is affected by the events in the Mediterranean region. In this situation, cooperation between the Union and Council is vital for guaranteeing energy requirements and avoiding a rise in the oil price on the global market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also think that it is time to conclude the 20 years of negotiations by signing the Free Trade Agreement, which would be so beneficial to both sides.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are here this evening to discuss this Parliament’s reports on the Gulf Cooperation Council. I understand that some political groups would have preferred to have postponed the discussion so as to better reflect the strategic times the Arab world is going through.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, at the time you started drafting no-one could have guessed what the world would be like today, nor what challenges the countries and people of the entire Arab region would be facing. In line with our conviction that each country is different from the others, the European Union is responding to different situations with different adapted responses. You heard Cathy Ashton yesterday on all these: whether Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen or Bahrain, the European Union is faced with many critical choices and decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report we are discussing this evening is focused on the Gulf Cooperation Council and its countries, some of which are also experiencing calls from their populations to take better account of their political, social and economic aspirations. Gulf governments are responding in different ways: substantial financial packages to alleviate the most pressing and social needs, announcements for political reforms, ceding some legislative powers to elected bodies, or openness to comprehensive and inclusive national dialogues.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we have also seen violence. Within the limits of our discussion tonight this is especially true of Bahrain. We have been following this closely; Cathy Ashton has repeatedly stated her concern at reports of serious violence on the streets and at the signs of increasing sectarian tensions. She has also called on the security forces present in the country to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. She has raised her voice many times in calling for dialogue as the only way forward. All of this has been done using a mix of public statements, which you have seen, and direct contacts with the authorities concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question for us is: where does all this lead to? What should the EU do? How should we read your report against the backdrop of these events? Yesterday Cathy Ashton noted she preferred engagement to isolation and I share that view. Your report calls for more contacts and not less and I agree. As trade Commissioner I would welcome better opportunities for exchanges between businesspeople. This is a time for us Europeans to stand ready to foster more contacts with the populations of the Gulf countries. It is also time for us Europeans to stand ready to respond positively to any request we may get for Europe to facilitate unprecedented dialogue leading to reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not shy away from defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, but we should not dictate or impose our models of democracy on others either. Europe firmly believes that reforms must come from within. I believe this is right also with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It is not for me to tell this Parliament how to go about dealing with the report before it. What I believe is that we need to think in strategic terms, and for that dialogues and engagements are essential.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should stand ready to lend all its support to dialogue and reform processes in the region. We are ready to provide political support to reform, and also know-how and expertise to address more specific issues. We welcome any such opportunity but this can only happen if and when the countries in the region ask for our assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">One final word on the free trade area with the Gulf for which I am directly responsible. I trust that when the right circumstances on the ground materialise we will be able to proceed on the basis of a common EU determination to further trade relationship objectives in relation to the Gulf Cooperation Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Needless to say stability is a necessary condition both for the political contacts between governments and citizens to be enforced, and for trade flows and business to operate effectively. Thank you for your attention and I would more specifically thank the rapporteur, Mr Baudis.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I believe that it is absolutely vital for the EU to formulate a more ambitious policy in respect of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and its member states, particularly at a time when the European Union is exiting an economic crisis and in view of the disasters – an earthquake together with a tsunami – which have hit Japan. I am pleased that the report covers issues such as energy in its broadest sense, industry, scientific research and the development of education. The European External Action Service should therefore allocate more employees and increase the number of diplomatic missions open in GCC countries, in order to bring about closer cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also believe that we should welcome all efforts undertaken as part of free trade negotiations to guarantee safe and secure supplies of raw materials. Cooperation between the EU and the GCC should encompass further support for exchange programmes involving students, scientists and professionals. In its report, the European Parliament stresses that the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and the GCC is a priority for further cooperation with our Mediterranean partners. The European Union should therefore develop an appropriate strategy to support the process of regional integration.</p>

      <p sl="de">It seems that the people of the six states in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which incidentally are the EU’s most important trading partners in the Arab world, do not believe that the reforms that have been taking place there over recent years are adequate. It is not yet clear to what extent the plans to inject huge sums of money to support the economies and improve social conditions in the two poorest of the six member states could help to bring an end to the ongoing demonstrations. Although the Gulf Cooperation Council disputes the legitimacy of Colonel Gaddafi and supports the idea of a no-fly zone, demonstrators have been fired on in Saudi Arabia, which is also a member state, and in Bahrain demonstrators have also been subjected to violent treatment. Even the sending of special units by the Gulf Cooperation Council to protect important infrastructure facilities in Bahrain is controversial, because the Shiite opposition is calling on the international community to protect the people from military intervention. It seems as if the introduction of a no-fly zone has opened up a Pandora’s box. The EU must not allow itself to be dragged into the internal affairs of states in the Middle East and that is what is threatening to happen, because the balance in Bahrain could change very rapidly. We have seen what agreements are worth after a coup in the case of the readmission agreements. Therefore, we should wait to see how the situation develops instead of pressing ahead now.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the adoption of the Baudis report as, now more than ever, the European Union needs to have a coherent strategy in its relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Firstly, the member states of this organisation have a growing influence on the Arab-Muslim world and can play an important role in intercultural dialogue. Furthermore, I believe that specific measures need to be taken to raise the Union’s profile in this region and promote mutual understanding. Ways for doing this include establishing cooperation in the press and audiovisual sector, so as to remedy the lack of information about Europe. Finally, I believe that the recent events in Bahrain force us to base the Union’s relations with the GCC more firmly on respect for human rights and basic freedoms. At the moment, we need to ensure that the demonstrators’ calls for democratic reforms are heard as part of a genuine political dialogue. The way to resolve the recent conflicts in Bahrain, for example, is by engaging civil society and not by using violent repression.</p>

      <p sl="en">A free trade agreement means fewer barriers to mutual cooperation and trade. I therefore support such an agreement, in principle. The states belonging to the Gulf Cooperation Council are undoubtedly important trading partners, particularly because they possess the basic raw material of our age – oil. I also welcomed the fact that the report, in addition to trade, also mentions the shortcomings of our trading partners in the area of human rights. Despite this, however, I hesitated for a long time over whether to vote for the report. Some of the states represented in the Gulf Cooperation Council have two faces. One face smiles at us in a friendly way and says it is our ally in the fight against Islamic terrorism. The other, however, is less visible and devotes billions of dollars every year to the spreading of religious ‘education' which calls for violence against Christians, Jews and all non-Muslims. Eventually, however, I voted in favour of the report, because I also expect the Commission to tell us who is providing financial support for this hatred, when it begins detailed monitoring of manifestations of violence against Christians in Islamic states.</p>
