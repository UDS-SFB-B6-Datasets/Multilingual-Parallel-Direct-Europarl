      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to make a few comments about the reform of our wine sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to offer my particular thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for his remarkable hard work in bringing this draft together. Parliament has made a valuable contribution to a debate which, I must say, has at certain times been very emotionally charged. I am ready to follow your suggestions in a number of areas, at least to some extent. For example, with regard to the grubbing-up scheme, I see some advantages in reducing the five years to three years as suggested in the report. I have also listened to your concerns about channelling some spending on wine through the rural development budget. But let me remind you that all the money from the wine budget will be allocated specifically for the wine regions. Nevertheless, I will be willing to propose a lower transfer of spending into the rural development budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three big issues where the Commission, the Presidency and most Member States still have to find a consensus in the final sprint to get reform finalised this month. The first issue is the national envelopes. There was always going to be a debate about exactly what measures should be allowed in this envelope, that is to say, which menu we should put into the envelope. I am prepared to be a bit flexible here. For example, I am open to putting into the envelope certain ideas concerning innovation and the restructuring of wine sellers, but I think we still need to keep a clear demarcation line between what is possible within the national envelopes and what is possible within rural development policy, to avoid a situation where you can actually finance an investment from both sides, what is called the ‘double guichet ’.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, the national envelopes are no place for permanent crisis distillation measures. Support for crisis distillation holds back competitiveness and we must abolish it completely and not try to reintroduce it through the back door. Also there is no possibility of reopening a general discussion on how large the envelopes of the different Member States should be. If we reopen this debate – a Pandora’s box – I can guarantee that there would be no agreement at the end of this year. I can foresee a very long and very difficult discussion if this is going to take place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second big issue is capitalisation. There has been a huge row about this and I have not simply blocked my ears to this discussion. Nevertheless, the status quo does hold a genuine problem to be solved. Aid for enrichment with must cannot continue at the same level in this manner. It is an old-fashioned, inefficient, ineffective, costly and trade-distorting support and, this being said, I clearly understand the importance of keeping the balance between enrichment with sugar and must in order to arrive at a compromise supported by the wine producers in both the southern and northern parts of Europe. We will find a way through this. I have listened to the broad call for continuing to allow enrichment with sugar, but – let us be clear – I am not inclined to accept the status quo, so any compromise would imply new conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third big issue is the discussion on the end of the planting rights system. I am listening to arguments about when the system could come to an end, but we cannot afford to kick the whole idea into the long grass. The wine sector clearly needs more freedom to respond to demand as soon as possible, so my suggestion of prolonging the system of planting rights until the end of 2013 was based on the clear idea of a two-stage approach to balancing the sector – first grubbing-up to bring down the production, and then liberalisation to give the successful producers the freedom to expand. I have listened to the comments from the sector but one thing is clear – the final date for the planting rights system is indispensable. What that exact date will be, will be part of the final compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">So overall, I have been listening to arguments from all the different sides, including all the arguments from the European Parliament, but one iron fact has not changed: our wine sector still needs reform if we want to keep it at the front of the pack. We have to seize the chance now and agree on a real reform. Carrying out reform will mean that we have to invest effort, but I am quite sure that we will get a good return. The cost of inaction is too high for us to accept, and I hope that we can agree on this point.</p>

    <intervention id="2-016" speaker_id="28459" name="Giuseppe CASTIGLIONE" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Italy" birth_date="05-10-1963" birth_place="Bronte" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats" m_state="IT">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her cooperation with Parliament during this lengthy process. I also thank her for her appreciation of the European Parliament’s work, a significant and interesting job of work involving a major input from the Committee on Agriculture, but also from the entire House and all colleagues. Thank you, Commissioner, for having proposed a very ambitious reform, one whose aims we cannot fail to endorse.</p>
      <p sl="it">Consumption is falling and imports are rising, all of which means that a radical form is vital. Our wine-growing sector needs a fresh start: new life blood, new energy and new proposals. You are right when you say that if we wish to remain competitive, if we wish to remain world leaders in the sector, we need to invest in the wine sector. We have to keep an eye on the market, we have to produce for the market, and we have to penetrate the market with top-quality products.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, Commissioner, I have attempted – along with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and the European Parliament, whom I would thank once again – to envisage in the report a comprehensive, coherent reform which is above all transparent. The system must be capable of meeting our producers’ needs, of supplying the wherewithal for them to be competitive and successful.</p>
      <p sl="it">All in all, we have sought to draw up a text providing suitable responses to common requirements, but also to respect, stimulate and in some case settle differences between the different national settings. I have just one preliminary remark: we need a radical change of mind-set, of production strategy. We must break away from the logic of quantity and instead pursue quality production – excellence – in a way that celebrates the specific national, regional and local characteristics of European wine-growing.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why, Commissioner, we agree to the abolition of market mechanisms which have proved inefficient, which are ineffective and have merely added to surplus, poor-quality production. I would give only one example: crisis distillation, which has now become a routine structural measure and is no longer a means of responding to emergency situations. EUR 500 million per year for distillation had become untenable. We therefore support a more efficient use of economic resources: for national development programmes and for the implementation of measures better tailored to the specific needs of each producer country.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, Commissioner, we saw fit in the report to extend the list of available measures: we decided to include restructuring of the sector, research, innovation and qualitative improvements. All these actions will encourage that entrepreneurial creativity so badly needed by our wines. It is crucial in the same vein to encourage promotion campaigns, not only on international markets but also on domestic markets. We have said so before, and this fact also emerged from the analysis conducted by the Committee on Agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is absurd to think we can compete beyond our borders if we cannot be at the front of the pack at home, if we cannot convince our fellow citizens of the quality of the wines we produce. That is why the report advocates a harmonised system of protection for designations of origin and geographical indications, clear and transparent labelling, and positively identified oenological practices. Only then will consumers, who are central here, have faith in what they buy.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is thus essential, Commissioner, for designations of origin and geographical indications, which embody the quality of European wine-growing, to be well protected. Protection means the obligation to produce within the designated area, but it also means confining the reference on the label to the vintage year exclusively to wines with a designation of origin or a geographical indication. These are the only wines subjected to ongoing checks, and hence the only ones for which it is possible to ensure the truthfulness of the information given; otherwise producers of quality wines would be at a disadvantage and consumers would be misled.</p>
      <p sl="it">With the same logic in mind, and for the sake of coherence, the report supports the proposal for a voluntary grubbing-up scheme with payment of a premium, so that those wishing to leave the market can do so with dignity. Furthermore, I cannot refrain from expressing my satisfaction that the Commissioner has just agreed to my idea of reducing the five years to three. It seems in fact that the number of hectares eligible for grubbing-up has fallen from 200 000 to 175 000.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unlike our original proposal, the report also strives to meet wine-growers’ need for future certainty. Given this need for certainty, we cannot decide to liberalise planting rights as of now, before seeing whether – and above all how well – the new system functions.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why the report provides for planting rights to be preserved at least until 2013 and calls on the Commission to present an impact assessment on the first phase of the reform, so as to be able to decide what to do next in full knowledge of the facts. It should of course be borne in mind that decisions taken in areas with geographical indications must be taken with due regard for – and under the supervision of – those who have invested their capital and labour in these projects. If it then proves that the system hampers the development of those who are competitive, we can increase circulation at Community level and ensure that, where reserves exist, they are properly used.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have one final remark, Commissioner: there can be no denying that the debate has been dominated by the question of sugaring. Coming as I do from a country like Italy where the use of sucrose is prohibited, and especially coming from Sicily where must is produced, no one can understand better than I do the Commissioner's disappointment on this issue. Nevertheless, we are talking about the need to give European wines a new lease of life and make them competitive, equipping them to compete in the marketplace.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is our goal, and in order to attain it we have attempted to look beyond national differences. Thank you, Commissioner, for your cooperation and above all for your appreciation of the European Parliament’s work. We have put into this reform …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a long and sometimes contentious debate on this subject. Let me express my thanks to the rapporteur. He has earned a great deal of respect for his work, which he performed in a focused manner, cooperating well with all his fellow committee members.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, the common organisation of the wine market must be reformed. It must be adapted to take account of present circumstances and future markets. At the same time, Commissioner, this proposal raises the question as to whether the Commission ought to interfere in the small things that help to create a regional identity, in the methods that have been practised in particular regions for centuries and underlie the culture of those regions? Such interference certainly does not help ordinary people. People sometimes do not understand what is going on. It is incomprehensible that we should prohibit sucrose while at the same time be signing agreements to import wine produced with sucrose from countries outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, as the third institution alongside the Council and Parliament, the Commission should concentrate on its own specific task, namely making proposals which foster the continuing development of the Community, which promote that whole development process. The common organisation of the market in wine is part of that process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say on this point that the compromises we reached in committee, for which we grappled and, in some cases, are still grappling, are good for the whole House. I endorse them on behalf of the PPE-DE Group: we all support the compromises. We shall reject any amendments that run counter to them.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, today the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are to decide on the future of one of the most complex common organisations of agricultural markets in Europe. The European Parliament gave its opinion in good time before the Council’s opinion, and this is due to the intensive efforts made by our rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, and all the efforts of the political groups.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, I would like to stress certain points which you must take into account in the Council’s final decision on reform of the common organisation of the wine market.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, reform of the wine market cannot be carried out on a linear, bookkeeping model like the model you used in the common organisation of the sugar market, which we were called on, two months ago, to re-examine because it has reached an impasse. Reform of the wine market cannot be based on the disastrous model of the common organisation for cotton and tobacco, with the transfer of funds to the second pillar, which has resulted in a decline in production of these two products, while the countryside has become depopulated. The wine market needs a strong budget in the first pillar in order to strengthen the measures directly for the vine-growers, who will be called on to improve quality and to monitor their production, and also to strengthen the policy of promoting all wines, inside and outside Europe, thus boosting their commercial distribution on the markets.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, the European Parliament wants a new common organisation of the market which will prioritise an aggressive promotion policy rather than a defensive import policy. The European Parliament’s report will secure aid for vine-growers who apply measures to stabilise supply, upgrade quality and protect the environment. Market regulation measures are retained and adapted to current needs, such as the distillation of by-products, which operates as a mechanism for improving quality and at the same time regulating the market and supply. The report proposes a rationalised grubbing-up scheme which does not waste valuable Community funds on reducing the dynamic of the European wine sector, and it fixes aid for wine-growers at the regional average for assistance, without the restriction of the EUR 350 per hectare ceiling.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, we take the view that restrictions must be placed on all those measures that create surpluses, disrupt the balance of the market and create distorted and unfair prices at the expense of other wines. Here, on behalf of the Socialist Group and also personally as Katerina Batzeli, I shall applaud any measure proposed by the Commission that maintains balance on the question of enriching with sugar, because, as has also been said by the Socialist Group, we have contributed to a balanced motion in order to avoid creating transitional problems.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nevertheless, the new common organisation of the market should enrich and also respect the consumer’s wine knowledge and enhance consumer protection through labelling policy. The Committee on Agriculture has specified, amongst other things, indication of the CO2 percentage in Amendment 166, information relating to public health matters in Amendment 157, and information on the production of wine from hybrid or genetically modified vines, in the zu Baringdorf amendment. We should reinforce this respect for the consumer with labelling that includes details of the wine-making practices followed.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, we wish to signal a new policy on two categories of wine: the category using geographical indications or a designation of origin, and table wines. These are two different products and both have a place on the international European market, and I do not think we should have dividing lines which have regional impact.</p>
      <p sl="el">In conclusion, I would like to say that the complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy reform cannot be treated as an impasse or as a failing of the institutional bodies. It is due, Commissioner, to the cultural dimension of this product, which we should respect in our proposals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in vino veritas or, to quote Goethe, life is too short to drink bad wine. These sayings sum up the essential point of reforming the EU market in wine. What our report is about is the quality of European wine, which can certainly stand comparison with that of imports from the New World. So what is the status quo ? In 2006, wine production accounted for 5% of the total value of agricultural output in the EU. With 45% of the world’s vineyard surface, 65% of its production, 57% of its consumption and 70% of the volume of exports, European wine enjoys a leading position in the world market. In the world of wine, we are a global superpower!</p>
      <p sl="de">Accordingly, there was a need for action to consolidate our superpower status and particularly to raise the quality of our wines. The reforms that you proposed, Commissioner, included an immediate end to crisis distillation. I believe that many of the things you mentioned, such as private storage and the ending of export subsidies, must aid and, of course, the enhancement of wine with sugar, are central points of your proposals. We have to say, however, that they reflected a rather technocratic perspective from the outset, addressing questions such as whether there should be a link between sugaring and must aid.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view this Parliament has negotiated quite a good compromise between North and South, given that their respective concerns have dominated this issue. In the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we struck a very, very good balance with our compromises. In this context my special thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, who made great efforts to broker compromises, and we managed to take account of everyone’s concerns.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we have moulded the initial technocratic solution into a new elegant shape. We have a balance between North and South. I also wish to thank you, Commissioner, for indicating in your speech that you essentially intend to follow this line.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are the main points? Besides the compromise that allows continued sugaring, another key aspect of our report is the protection of regional products.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the light of this quality drive for European wine, there is also a continuing need for national support measures, and these have been set at EUR 1.3 billion. We believe that these matters should remain part of the first pillar, so that payments can actually go direct to growers. In addition, there was a need to refer – and this, I believe, is one of our primary achievements – to the need to give special attention to designations of origin and geographical indications on labels. That is an extremely important issue in our view, because indications of the geographical origin of wines are, of course, a matter of intellectual property. That has to be protected, and I believe we have obtained a very good compromise on this point.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ALDE Group will support these compromises, that is to say the whole package of compromises, because we believe they constitute a good solution. We hope that the Council will now adopt our suggestions. The voice of the European Parliament is the voice of the people as well as the voice of the wine producers and consumers. We ask you, Commissioner, to fight for these things too in your dealings with the Council and in the public domain in general.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the text on which we are about to vote constitutes a good compromise and considerably improves the Commission's initial proposal.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our aim is still to launch a reform geared to revitalising the sector on both the domestic and international markets. Global demand is not falling, but rising, so the right approach is not to produce less but to invest in the quality and character of European wines, in cutting costs, in promoting wine so as to expand the market and in helping young people to establish vineyards.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is equally necessary to limit the reduction in European wine production, as proposed by the Commission, by increasing the Member States' autonomy to govern the grubbing-up scheme. We must avoid destroying vineyards which, while perhaps not having a particularly strong market position, produce high-quality regional wines, have well-established historical traditions and even today make up the social fabric of entire regional areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">Despite creating the conditions for greater competitiveness, this reform must retain links with the past and promote the continuation of wine-growing as a factor in preserving the land and the environment. We are therefore in favour of allocating the earmarked resources over three years rather than five and distributing them primarily on the basis of historical data, broadly according to the same criterion used for all other reforms adopted until now.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, we are opposed to the liberalisation of new oenological practices and the use of imported must to enrich our wines or blend them with third country wines, because we believe that this could be detrimental to the wine's image and could compromise the consumer's trust in the product, with extremely serious consequences for consumption. On the other hand, we think it is vital to provide aid for concentrated musts and rectified concentrated musts used for enrichment purposes, so as to protect an oenological practice common in many Community regions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We believe that investment by producers must be borne in mind and that any disruptions to trade flows which could increase available supplies must be avoided. This reform must encourage the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, as a means of better guaranteeing and protecting European wines in the context of multilateral negotiations and bilateral trade agreements.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, Commissioner, we are against the full liberalisation of planting rights from 2014 onwards for wines with designations of origin and geographical indications, and we can endorse the rapporteur's proposal that the new reform should enter into force on 1 August 2009.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, we want wine to be a unique beverage, both in its production and in its consumption. What I mean is that we do not want any oenological methods that take us in the direction of Coca-Cola; we want the future of designations of origin and geographical indications to be secured. We want to see support for organic production methods, and it is our wish – we have tabled an amendment to this effect – that regions should be able to decide by a majority vote that their wines can be traded in bottles only. We agree with you that permanent distillation of wine is inappropriate, and its introduction through the back door of crisis distillation must be prevented. We share your view on that point.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the question of planting rights, we believe there must be a grubbing-up option. In point of fact, if no indication is given that new planting will be authorised at some time in a given location, the decision to grub up there is not based on the quantity of wine that can be sold. This linkage, in short, is imperative, and we support it.</p>
      <p sl="de">When you speak of enrichment with grape must or sugar and say that there must be a shift in the balance between these two methods, that is fine by us, because it basically means that chaptalisation will remain legal. If a compromise were found on that basis, we would regard it as an acceptable outcome. Sugaring is an old oenological process. We should therefore preserve it and reject the Americans’ many unreasonable demands regarding our winemaking processes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Provided that our amendments are carried, we shall support the rapporteur’s draft in its entirety.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Castiglione that - as the Minister, Mr De Castro, has said - the proposal having emerged from the committee responsible and now before Parliament is worse than the one originally put forward by the Commissioner. We are talking here about millions of individuals who are dedicated to a product which has made Europe great on account of its quality and links with the land.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first point I should like to make concerns grubbing-up. We are told that the area affected will fall to between 175 000 and 200 000 hectares. My first question is this: who will grub up the vines and who will take over this grubbed-up land, and what is wrong with proposing that the funds be used - and perhaps even reduced rather than increased - with a view to restructuring these vineyards so as to improve quality? I would ask Parliament the following: why must we expel dozens or even hundreds of workers and farmers in order to make way for large multinationals, as is happening in Sicily, Mr Castiglione?</p>
      <p sl="it">The point, then, is this: why use European funds for grubbing-up, rather than using them to improve quality and for business restructuring? We have adopted so many measures in this House and in Community policies over recent years!</p>
      <p sl="it">My second point relates to the free market in the rights of areas under vines. Why should the market be liberalised for the whole of Europe? What is the sense in buying a hectare under vines in Sicily, Campania, Greece or elsewhere and transferring it to another area? That hectare under vines is linked to a given quality and production, a typical product, an ecotype established in that area. Why make this sort of proposal?</p>
      <p sl="it">Are we seeking here, too, to encourage the large-scale buy-outs which are occurring in some parts of the Mediterranean? This is the key point, and it is why we believe that the Commission's proposal was better. The proposal emerging from Parliament is worse than the one advocated by the Commission, if what we want is a reform that improves quality and keeps farmers and other workers on the land. That is why we shall vote against a reform of this kind.</p>

      <p sl="cs">(Mr Chairman, the proposed wine sector reform puts the Czech Republic at a disadvantage and discriminates against it. The European Union, which did not object to the diluting of US wines now legally accessing the EU market with up to 30% of water and which tolerates the addition of acid to oversweet wines in southern Europe, that same European Union proposes a ban on the use of sucrose in the more northern European countries. The use of sucrose has been a tradition in our country for over 200 years. The EU wants to replace it with must concentrate, which will be willingly supplied at an inflated price by the southern European countries. The subsidy for the Czech Republic works out at EUR 85 per hectare of vineyards, while some favoured countries receive as much as EUR 245. This is because the European Union is trying to establish a so-called historic principle, which will discriminate against the new Member States. However, the wine grown and produced in the Czech Republic also gets consumed there. It does not, in any way, contribute to the surplus European production. In addition, that same Union now requires the Czech Republic to contribute financially to the advertising of European surplus wine in third countries. We demand therefore that the money for the wine sector reform be put into the national envelopes so that the Member States can allocate it according to their own needs.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Union has two ways of dealing with the surplus wine production. One is the senseless and barbaric distillation of wine into industrial alcohol and the other is the grubbing-up of vineyards: grubbing-up everywhere but where it should be done. In fact it would be enough to grub up all the illegally planted vineyards in those traditional southern countries, and one of them in particular, and the whole reform would be accomplished. The total area of those illegal vineyards actually equals the number of hectares that the EU needs to grub up. It is not as if the EU did not know the exact location and did not have the satellite pictures of the vineyards in Italy that were planted secretly and are over the quota, for example. In conclusion, yet another topic favoured by the Eurocrats comes up again in the proposed reform: the handing over of the competence in this matter from the Council to the Commission, that is to say to non-elected EU officials. In this way the smaller countries will be stripped of their right to decide, and the wine which has been traditionally grown in the Czech Republic since the time of the Roman Legions will become yet another product taken away from us in favour of the often illegal production in the southern countries of the EU. However, we have no intention of letting them deprive us of this wonderful tradition of ours.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I ask myself, is the reform really about good wine? Good wine, as we know, is the wine that sells. That means that the customer accepts its quality at the asking price. However, some EU countries produce unsellable wines at the cost of EUR 500 million a year.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Slovak Republic and other Member States have carried out an uncompromising reduction of their wine sector, which is the reason why they no longer produce unsellable wines. To create the national envelopes of financial aid on the basis of the so-called ‘historic principle’ runs against the rules of the market. It discriminates against us, penalising us permanently for not having supported the production of unsellable wines.</p>
      <p sl="sk">According to the proposed reform, we should be permanently receiving just a fraction of the aid being afforded to the producers of unsellable wines. That is the reason why we demand that aid be based solely on the area under vineyards, and it is on the same grounds of discrimination that we disagree with the changes to the labelling of wines and want to keep the existing system.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, next weekend the Council of Agriculture Ministers will likely take the political decision on this reform of the COM in wine.</p>
      <p sl="es">Wine is not just a foodstuff, it is also an economic gem in the agriculture sector, which has been severely penalised by Commission decisions in recent years. We are on time, for the first time in a long while: Parliament is going to draw up a report that can be used by the Council to determine its ultimate political decision this weekend. I must say I am genuinely satisfied with this, and wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, since for the first time the EP has resolved to focus on quality, culture, tradition, a Mediterranean product that has also been taken to other parts of Europe, a product which enhances our stature not only on our own continent, but around the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our wine – and let there be no doubt about this, ladies and gentlemen – is the best in the world; Europe’s wine is the best in the world. That is why we have to protect it and focus on promoting it: promoting it not only outside the EU, but here, too, because young people in Europe have stopped drinking wine in recent years. Why have they stopped drinking wine? Because we have not bothered to promote it or to encourage them to drink it.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must supply the tools of competitiveness to the wine sector to keep it competitive within and outside the European Union. We must promote wine consumption and involve young people and European society as a whole in a culture, the culture of wine tourism, the culture of wine consumption, the culture of wine know-how and the culture of discussion and participation within society.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, there is a shortage of funds for rural development because a political decision taken in December 2005 did not provide enough money for the second pillar. However, funding must not be secured to the detriment of the COMs, but by encouraging the Member States to allocate slightly more of their national budgets to the Community budget. It is not by taking money away from the farmers that we will fill a gap as huge as rural development in the European budget under this financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to planting rights, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that tools must be given to the sector to allow it to regulate itself. These tools must be legal tools and they must be issued here so as to continue to protect planting rights, which enable production to be controlled. There are already indications that it may be profitable to control such production, just as the designations of origin are strictly controls.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commitments must be upheld, and therefore we will vote against all the amendments tabled, especially any amendments that do not respect the commitments already made, and here I am referring to the Socialist Group.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I too want to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work, and also the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group, not only as shadow rapporteur for this report, but also for the own-initiative report that preceded this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Her work typifies the spirit of compromise and constructive attitude of the Socialists towards finding a balanced solution. The long months of debate have confirmed three things: the great importance of this sector in economic and social terms, despite being so badly mistreated in the past by the common agricultural policy; the fact that the current rules are out of step with the current market situation and changes in consumption patterns; and the need to introduce reforms to solve these problems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This debate has also revealed the high degree of consensus on the list of problems affecting the sector. However, we have not all agreed on the solutions proposed by the Commission, which is why the European Parliament’s constructive attitude is proven by the broad compromise reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and by the PSE Group’s detailed proposals. These proposals aim to supplement this compromise on the most sensitive issues such as: liberalisation of planting rights; grubbing-up of vines; addition of sugar and must aid; maintenance of potable alcohol, which is so important for some prestige wines such as port, the competitiveness of which must be guaranteed; crisis prevention; promotion and so on.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament’s position therefore provides real impetus and is a good indication to the Council and the Commission of the path that must be followed. The general lines of Parliament’s position show that it is possible to ultimately find a solution capable of responding to the sector’s general problems and also to the specific issues of the production regions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, at a time when we are about to start discussing the Health Check and, something which is of particular interest to us, the scenario for agriculture after 2013, it is vital that this reform be completed quickly. I therefore hope that Parliament will inspire the Council in the decisions that must be taken because Parliament’s attitude and the general line of its recommendations are a good sign for European vine and wine.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner, but allow me to say a particular word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for his excellent, thorough and valuable work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Meeting the challenges of international competition, through schemes to improve quality and protect typical characteristics, is the key objective that must be pursued by the reform of the European wine market. However, it is important to ensure that we retain aid for concentrated grape musts and rectified concentrated grape musts produced by the European Community, since this is an oenological practice common to many Community regions. With regard to sugaring, any use of sucrose for enrichment purposes should be indicated on the label, so as to achieve greater transparency and consumer information.</p>
      <p sl="it">National aid programmes must be used to target promotion campaigns within the European Union, as well as for the purposes of crisis prevention, research, development and above all improvements in wine quality.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as the liberalisation of planting rights is concerned, the postponement until 2013 might be acceptable for wines protected by designations of origin and geographical indications. So as to achieve a balanced situation for other wines, liberalisation should be allowed only following the Commission's impact assessment, to be carried out before the end of 2012.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one of the fundamental problems of the wine market is that more and more wine is being imported from third countries. We might well ask ourselves whether wine from these countries is better. The answer is that it is not. The quality of wine from third countries is no better than that of our wine, but their wine is much cheaper.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My homeland is mainly a wine-consuming country. My fellow citizens are interested in two criteria, namely price and quality. The identifying label is less important to them, yet it is common to pay more for the brand than for the quality of the wine. Promotion alone will not achieve anything. It will not attract price-conscious customers in the countries of the old Fifteen either. I have observed that for myself in shops in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I very much welcome the fact that the possibility of using the term fruit wine has been retained. This is a specific segment of the traditional market, and is not in competition with the grape wine market. As in the case of the definition of vodka, it is not acceptable to act to the detriment of the traditions of particular countries, brands or quality simply because the wine sector is experiencing problems.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we certainly agree with your wish to put an end to subsidies that encourage overproduction and have unacceptable perverse effects, but we cannot accept the fact you intend to make wine, which is first and foremost attached to a terroir and an increasingly standardised product sold all over the world, subject to the whims of fashion and marketing. I wish to highlight two points here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first the absolute necessity to protect the geographical indications and designations of origin, which are often questioned but nevertheless establish the link to the land that characterises the European agricultural model. We want you to highlight this model and not sacrifice it at the altar of larger markets to the sole benefit of money-grubbers. We also call for more attention to be paid to ecological vine-growing methods, which still require significant various chemical products and additives. In this regard, we would ask you to provide specific support for organic wine, the specifications for which are now being drawn up.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Biodiversity of terroirs , cultures and tastes, development and promotion of quality, and the extraordinary richness of European vines: these are the future and the principles that ought to form the basis of this reform.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we are highly critical of the European Commission’s proposal to reform the common organisation of the market in wine. In addition to the grubbing-up of vines, the proposal to liberalise planting rights is particularly worrying. We consider that the report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does not offer any protection in this respect. At stake are the European wine-growing heritage and the future of vast regions which not only form wine production areas with designations of origin or geographical indications, but also areas producing good table wines. As a result, in order to defend the traditional culture of vine and wine, employment and biodiversity, we insist on defending planting rights and maintaining support for restructuring vineyards, monitoring of production and maintenance of quality, with particular attention being paid to family-based agriculture and cooperative producers, support for the distillation of potable wine and use of grape musts produced in the region. However, we do not support the addition of sugar.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, beyond its technique on envelopes, premiums or plantings, this project – the third in 15 years – boils down to three ideas focused on a single objective. The first idea is Malthusianism. The winemakers are not to the Commission’s liking, so it wants to grub up, throw away the grapes, ban chaptalisation and curb production, in the same way as the milk or wheat shortages were brought about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second idea is laissez-faire capitalism for profit, laissez-faire for plantings, imports, watering down, adding wood shavings, fake wine, must imported to concoct a global wine gruel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third idea is globalism. After the single market and the single currency comes the single wine: a flavoursome woody ‘parkerised’ Coca-Cola wine, which would not even require any winemakers, because the real aim is to free up the Mediterranean’s winelands, especially those 250 000 hectares around Languedoc-Roussillon, two and a half billion square metres of land, where they will grub up the vineyards to plant houses, a market worth a thousand billion euro. The COM in wine would eventually become a COM in property.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here I am thus the Member for the winemaking Indians. I do not wish to take your scalp, Commissioner; All I want is for winemakers, who have been making people happy for over 2 000 years, to be left alone.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking our rapporteur for doing everything that was humanly possible to arrive at this compromise. Ever since the Commission first presented a document on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine and again in today’s discussion, we have seen that wine is one of the most sensitive of agricultural products; it is one of the most sophisticated but also stirs the emotions like few other products. I believe the European Parliament, especially the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, has managed to assemble and present a compromise package that reflects a wise choice of approach, ensuring, for example, that the traditional oenological methods used in the Member States are clearly explained on the basis of differences in European viniculture and – something I consider very important – that quality wines are set apart from table wines. It is imperative that designations of origin should remain in place. They are beneficial to wine producers, but most of all they benefit consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Preservation of the enrichment limits bolsters traditional wine production in Europe. The diverse climatic, geographical and structural conditions in which wine grapes are grown in Europe have to be taken into consideration. As an Austrian, I know how necessary certain measures are, but I am opposed to compulsory grubbing-up, because there is a need to observe consumer wine choices very closely and identify where there are prospects of further increasing consumption. Savings we achieve through these reforms – and I am also anxious to make savings – must remain in the first pillar and continue to support viniculture and wine producers in some way or other.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me conclude by saying that I believe the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has managed to present a coherent and prudent package, and I hope that tomorrow’s parliamentary vote will send a clear signal to the Council and the Commission that we want viniculture to have a future in Europe, too.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I first wish to congratulate the EP rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for his splendid work. The virtue of his report lies in that it includes many of the concerns expressed not only by ourselves as Members of the European Parliament, but also by the European wine industry.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, there have been certain changes since you submitted this proposal for a new wine COM. Some certain aspects have changed very little, while others have changed considerably, but I feel that many of the changes have been positive. For example, grubbing-up is no longer the main focus of the reform, and I was pleased to hear you say earlier that the Commission is now working with a time frame of three years, as Parliament is requesting, and not five years as you had suggested.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is a reform of a COM that is so important for European agriculture, as has been said from the outset, has some extremely positive aspects, and I thank you for that. For example, the regulations have been simplified and made more flexible, and that will help to make us more competitive. This point has already been made by Mrs Herranz in relation to the promotion of European wines within and outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">A large number of amendments have been tabled to your proposal to eliminate current market arrangements and replace them with a menu for national envelopes. It is obvious that market measures have already helped to maintain income for farmers and economic activity in rural areas, and continue to do so. Thus, without jeopardising Mr Castiglione’s compromise, I wish to table a new amendment to secure direct aid for diversification, aid which the Member States could include in their national allocations to help farmers in the transition to the new COM. The duration of this and the methods employed would be drawn up by the management committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, I feel that for stakeholders used to working with this COM, with back-up from the current market measures, this is the way to help them through the transition to diversification and guide them into the new COM which – I hope – the House will adopt tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I hope you can hear the message from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has made significant amendments to your reform proposal. I support the refusal to allow the automatic liberalisation of planting rights in 2014, particularly for wines protected by designations of origin and geographical indications. For other wines, the decision to liberalise planting rights ought to be taken only after the effects of the COM reform have been gauged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as chaptalisation is concerned, I feel that we should not waste our energy on this issue. What matters is maintaining the oenological practices that give European wines their quality and identity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would particularly like to mention table wines. The Commission’s proposal offers the possibility of referring to a specific place of origin: for example, wine from the coasts of Provence, wine from Andalusia, wine from Tuscany, etc. This will certainly confuse consumers and lead to unfair competition between quality designations of origin, which comply with strict specifications, and table wines, which have much freer production criteria. Let us therefore retain the current legislation, since the only reference ought to be the country in which the wine is produced: Spanish wine, Italian wine, French wine, etc.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As to the issue of the information to be provided on the label, I feel that it is important to mention the type of bottler: whether it is an independent winemaker, a group of producers, or some other format. The winemaking profession as practised in France has an extremely positive image, which is not necessarily the case for wines produced in other parts of the world. Therefore, I feel that it is important to provide some information in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, who has largely managed to unite the Members on a compromise text amid a debate which often aroused great passions, sending out a clear message so that the EU remains the world’s leading wine producer, guarantees a future for over one and a half million wine companies, and retains its ranking as leading exporter.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to focus on planting rights since, as we are all aware, the reform intends to liberalise the market by 2013 by eliminating planting rights and freezing funds, with no real alternative for 2.4 million vine growers in Europe. This would take out small and medium winemaking facilities at one fell swoop, and once again leave a market so culturally ours in the hands of half a dozen or so multinationals.</p>
      <p sl="es">I consider this to be unacceptable. Does the Commission fail to realise that the staunchest defenders of planting rights are the designations of origin – Rioja, in my case, for example – and that it is they who produce, sell and export the most wine and the best quality wine? I am from Navarra, where liberalisation has already been implemented: planting rights are worthless, but while in Navarra a kilo of grapes sells at 15 cent, the same kilo of grapes is worth more than 1 euro barely 10 kilometres away in La Rioja.</p>
      <p sl="es">While La Rioja sells all it has, in Navarra we have to resort to crisis distillation. Therefore, it cannot be denied that the gradual elimination of protectionism is a good thing, but it should not become a dogma. The Commission has not submitted a single serious report to show that liberalisation, elimination of these rights, in 2013 or whenever, will benefit the wine market.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Commission’s proposal aims to reduce funding and concentrate this sector in the large cartels. We know very well what the result will be: we have seen it with other crops. When thousands of hectares are grubbed up, thousands of small and medium-sized vine-growers will be wiped out, and areas – particularly those which are mountainous or less-favoured – will be deserted and depopulated, with an impact on biodiversity. The repercussions will be dramatic: unemployment and environmental problems will increase. Imports will increase, including wines of dubious quality, at the expense of public health.</p>
      <p sl="el">We reject the Commission’s proposal, and also the report by the Committee on Agriculture, because it introduces measures which are even worse: it allows the addition of sugars with a view to increasing the alcoholic strength with foreign matter, when we could achieve the same result with must. It also accepts the use of the term ‘wine’ for products which are not made from grapes, thus downgrading the quality of European wine, which is the world leader in exports.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, on his report. A great deal has already been said about the reform of the wine market and, although I have always been a supporter of the view that Community wines have to retain their quality, tradition and authenticity if they are to make progress and gain a competitive position, I nevertheless recognise that the advantage that southern Europe enjoys in terms of sunshine should not stand in the way of production in the north.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am sure that everyone here in this Chamber wants a balanced decision. I therefore believe that since the Council is gearing itself towards allowing the addition of sugar, it is right that it should make provision for maintaining the status quo, i.e. support for musts to enrich wines, so that the substantial difference in price between sugar and musts does not come as a serious blow to producers who traditionally use concentrated musts to increase alcoholic strength, especially as we are talking about an authentic wine product.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, I would like to add that the measure of grubbing up vines may be regarded as a way of limiting Community production, but we must take account of small island areas, where the Member State must be able to limit grubbing-up for social, economic and, above all, environmental reasons. Besides, those vineyards are not the ones responsible for Community overproduction; on the contrary, in most cases they produce wines of excellent quality.</p>
      <p sl="el">I shall conclude by saying that European wine is the best in the world. It is wine with tradition behind it. Wine originated here! We must therefore maintain quality and the tradition and also adopt a more aggressive policy: we should advertise because it is only here in Europe that consumption of alcohol is increasing among young people – an extremely unwelcome fact – while their consumption of wine is decreasing, and this shows that there is a lack of information.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this reform undoubtedly rewrites the fundamentals of the wine sector to make it competitive on world markets. Through the Castiglione report we have emphasised the fact that the competitive strength of European wine, and what has enabled it to overcome competition from the New World, is its quality.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, it is for the sake of quality that we have improved the Commission's proposal on certain points, such as on grubbing-up with reference to the time frame and the ecological constraints, and on the liberalisation of planting rights with the provisos recalled during this debate. We have supported the idea that there should be more careful checks to ensure that the approval of oenological practices is not made too easy, and we have come out in favour of increasing Community cofinancing for promotion campaigns.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, our support for quality cannot be reconciled with the practice of sugaring. We do understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this practice is favoured in some countries on economic grounds, but in that case we call for the same standard, the same scheme on aid for must as under the previous legislation. Above all, we believe that it is essential, for the sake of transparent and accurate information to consumers, that where sucrose is used this must be indicated on the label.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Wine is a drink with an age-old tradition, a drink which belongs to European culture. In vino veritas , the ancient Romans used to say. But wine is also an alcoholic beverage which is damaging to public health, in particular if it is consumed in copious quantities. Winegrowing is an important industry in many of the EU’s Member States and gives jobs and vitality to rural districts. I think of wine as a product which, to a large extent, should be able sell itself if it is of good quality. Hence the report’s proposals for substantial and increased support for its marketing are difficult to understand. It cannot be the responsibility of the European taxpayer to support the costs of Europe’s winegrowers so that they can sell products which could not compete in free market conditions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the one hand, the EU talks about moderate drinking; on the other hand, it wants to sell more wine. The two things do not go together. Of course, the EU’s wine market needs to be reformed, but let us do it sensibly. Wine markets vary and, by tradition, function in different ways, and the desires and demands of the public in the EU also vary.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, two proposed measures that stand out are those of grubbing up the vines and adding sugar to wine.</p>
      <p sl="el">The first is a counterproductive and environmentally unfriendly procedure essentially entailing the forced exodus from their jobs of thousands of small and medium-sized growers who, instead of receiving assistance to stay in their jobs, are being sent away to form a cheap workforce.</p>
      <p sl="el">As for the addition of sugar, our rejection is based on the fact that a permitted increase to 4.5% vol. and the use of the term ‘wine’ for drinks which are not made from grapes will downgrade the quality and special characteristics of wine. Furthermore, the so-called ‘simplification of labelling’ will contribute further to the downgrading of quality because it will not include the obligation to indicate the area where the wine was produced.</p>
      <p sl="el">Here I would like to point out that rightly or wrongly, for example in my country in the past, mass grubbing-up operations were carried out, for which, however, no financial assistance measures are now included at European level. With a clear conscience we shall vote against the proposal, and shall support the minority proposal which addresses the social and economic concerns of the producers in my country, Cyprus, and those of other European producers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Now should be the time to assist the producers, instead of sending them into a spiral of unemployment and reduced income.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I come from a constituency in Scotland which does not produce wine. Indeed, climate change will have to change things considerably before we can produce any wine in Scotland! However, we do produce some very good whisky, which I would recommend.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Parish, who has to attend a meeting with Mr Michel Barnier in Paris, and on behalf of the UK wine sector, which Members know is very small – it represents 0.01% of the whole of EU wine production – but which seeks no subsidy or financial assistance from Europe at all. However, unless there is an increase in the de minimis level of production to 50 000 hl, the UK would have to impose a planting ban up until 2014. In a tiny sector like this, where there is some need for expansion, it would be deeply unfair if we were to do that. Even if the UK sector expanded fourfold by the end of the planting rights system, which is highly unlikely, it would still only represent 0.05% of total EU production, which is one 2000th of entire EU wine production.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore hope that Members will be sympathetic to Mr Parish’s amendments. I am not trying in any way to undermine the compromise. Mr Castiglione has done a wonderful job – we had 795 amendments – and, by seeking a compromise, has got the amendments down to manageable levels. I do not want to do anything to upset that, but I hope there will be sympathy for the UK position.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I first wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for bringing about a considerable shift in the Commission’s positions. We are certainly faced with a paradox here: on the one hand, there has never been so much wine drunk all over the world, and on the other, although in 10-15 years we will be witnessing record progress in wine consumption worldwide, we are told that Europe is overproducing. Thus I have the feeling that, rather than overproduction, what we have here is a sales problem, mainly down to marketing, and that is why I do not want the reform proposed to us today to be tempted to lower the sector’s standards even slightly in order to fall into line with the new wine-producing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must remember what has happened to European industry. Today Europe’s leading industrial producer is Germany. Germany has stayed at the top of the class, it has refused to cut down on production and today it is the world’s leading exporter, even with the arrival of China and India on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot cut back on the quality of our vineyards and their brand image. We must not, therefore, give in to a crude industrialisation of the wine industry, which in the future would supply us with Heineken wine, Danone wine, Coca-Cola wine and Pepsi-Cola wine. I do feel, however, that the Commission is tempted to get rid of the smallest and favour the biggest. That would result in us losing our soul!</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am thus asking you, Commissioner, to ensure that all of the elements that contribute to the quality of wine and can improve that quality – reducing yields, marketing support, careful protection of geographical indications and designations of origin – are preserved, not only within the EU, but also outside it, when it comes to major multilateral negotiations. I feel this is extremely important: otherwise we will be losing what is undoubtedly one of the most important elements of our agricultural industry, and our European civilisation: wine is a product of culture and civilisation. This is why we cannot give in to the mirages of the market and industrialisation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, politics is the art of the possible. That maxim also applies to this latest reform of the common organisation of the market in wine. It must be said, however, that the Commission’s assumption in 2006 was unmarketable wine surpluses in the EU, which have not materialised, and that its legislative proposal largely disregarded the opinion delivered by Parliament in February.</p>
      <p sl="de">As was the case back in 1999, we have managed, by dint of tenacity and resourcefulness and in close cooperation with the trade, particularly in the cross-party working group on wine, to work out a compromise with which the wine trade in both southern and northern Europe should be able to live, provided that growers produce good wines and vintners are able to market them effectively inside and outside the EU. It is our intention to create the requisite set of instruments and make the regions responsible for using them within an appropriate financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the irksome dispute about winemaking processes that was unnecessarily fuelled by the Commission, we once again reached an agreement, very largely on the basis of the 1999 compromise, even though the Commissioner is still not happy with that. Common sense and awareness that sales problems in the South will not be solved by making it impossible to produce marketable wine in the North have won the day, and I hope they will also secure a large majority here.</p>
      <p sl="de">The devil, as always, is in the detail. I respect the compromise, for which the rapporteur himself had to make concessions too, and all credit to him for that. For this reason I do not intend to table any new amendments, although I shall not refrain from expressing my opinion when it comes to the vote on disastrous specific proposals that have nothing to do with the compromise.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is utterly counterproductive, for instance, to insist that wine labels bear an indication of the origin of EU grape must which is used to enrich the wine if the aim is to encourage that form of enrichment. The important thing is that the reforms help to guarantee sufficient production potential in terms of quantity and quality to maintain our global market lead and to ensure that we in the EU and elsewhere drink far more wine for the sake of our health!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur. In addition, I would also like to express my gratitude to all members of the Committee on Agriculture for the hard work they have put into achieving consensus on such an essential but also very complicated issue as reform of the market in wine.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think we all agree that changes in the sector are needed in response to the processes of globalisation and trade liberalisation. We do not always agree, however, on how to bring about such changes. There is therefore all the more reason for us to deem the agreement reached on key issues for wine producers a joint success. The agreement takes account of the needs and conditions of the various regions of the Community, which differ in terms of natural environment and climate. Wine production methods therefore differ accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In particular, I wish to highlight the amendment enabling Member States to use the term wine to refer to wines other than grape wines. In certain parts of Europe the fruit wine tradition dates as far back as the 12th century. This is all part of our common cultural heritage. Consequently, it is important not to introduce any potentially confusing changes to the labelling of fruit wines. Wines produced using fruits such as apples and currants are marketed under the designation of fruit wine or wine named after the fruit in question. These wines established themselves on the European market many years ago, and I am glad that the provision regarding fruit wine has been retained.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much. I would like to raise three issues, since the wine sector is too far-reaching for me to cover all the issues. The first issue is that of grubbing aids, the second is that of restructuring aid for upgrading vineyards, and the third is that of the compulsory distillation of by-products.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I agree with the bases for the reform. The current rules for the wine sector are unsustainable. Aid for distillation must be stopped because it is wasteful. Instead, surpluses are created, and in order to stop this we must grub a significant proportion of vineyards. We have been OK up to now. The trouble starts here, since this can only be done properly if we grub the vineyards and concentrate grubbing aid on the regions that produced the surplus. This is not happening. In fact, what is happening is that the Member States and regions that do not produce a surplus will have to bear an unfairly large burden under this reform. This is particularly unacceptable for the new Member States since, before the accession, when we were still outside the EU, we did not receive any distillation aid, nor did we produce any surplus. Since then, approximately 10% of our vineyards in Hungary have been grubbed. This is not taken into consideration by the reform, which moreover is taking place now, when not only do we not produce a surplus but we have become a net importer. This reform burdens most of all the countries that had balanced wine production, and indeed we produced more or less as much wine as was consumed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The second issue I would like to raise is that of aid for upgrading vineyards. It is particularly unacceptable that this form of this aid is falling in Hungary. Madam Commissioner should not be afraid that she is opening Pandora’s box! It is much better to have a debate than to make an unfair decision. The Parliament’s decision will offer an appropriate solution, and it will recommend that upgrade aid should not be less in any Member State than it was in 2007-2008, and this would be a good solution.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I also support the repeal of the rules relating to the compulsory distillation of by-products, because it is a wasteful, superfluous measure and it is not sustainable from the perspective of environmental protection. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I agree that wine regulation up to now has been bad, and at the same time it is very questionable whether this wine reform will be good. There are countless questions, because it is obvious that this reform is essential but will be to the detriment of the poorest wine-producing regions. The distribution of the national envelopes system – which the Commissioner spoke about – is extremely harmful to the new Member States. This wine reform is discriminatory and rewards those who have up to now produced poor quality wine for distillation because they receive their money all the same.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Parliament has moved in the right direction, and the final compromise could be that two thirds are the area and quantity and one third is the historical reference. It will be very useful to still have the opportunity for increasing the alcohol content for sugaring. Marketing is an extremely important factor, but this must be ensured within the Union too. I completely agree with the repeal of distillation, and this is the most positive element of the reform, but I reiterate that this money will be received by those who have produced for distillation up to now. The concept of grubbing aid is flawed, since it is very attractive for the poorest Member States. We in the new Member States will also have to grub grapes that produce good quality. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the main aim of this reform should be to achieve sustainability and improved competitiveness for the Union’s wine sector. It is also important to strengthen the position of renowned European wines that boast centuries-old traditions so that they do not lose out to wines from the so-called New World. The budget allocated to that market should be used more wisely. We should not promote distillation. Instead, we ought to promote European wines in order to recover lost markets and win new ones.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to mention three important issues. Firstly, as regards the option to add sugar, the status quo must be maintained. Secondly, the status quo must also be maintained as far as fruit wines are concerned. This means that it should remain possible to use the term wine to designate fruit wines. Thirdly, the de minimis level should be increased to 50 000 hectolitres, for example. This would stimulate production and contribute to the development of local winemaking in countries that do not produce large quantities of wine. The change would not have any impact on the Community market in wine.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, as we have heard today, the tradition of viniculture goes back hundreds of years. For decades we have been trying to improve the quality of our wines, and those efforts have been extremely successful, which I, as an Austrian, can say of my own country’s efforts too, particularly those of my home province of Burgenland.</p>
      <p sl="de">Part of this success, however, has been down to the use of sucrose as required. Having to top up the sugar content of wine with must concentrate from other regions would mean influencing and even altering the character of our region’s wines. We certainly cannot consent to that, nor would it make any sense to our growers, who have been nurturing high quality standards for many years.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is unthinkable that sucrose as an additive should be abolished and replaced with must concentrate to compensate for the abandonment of the very costly practice of crisis distillation. For this reason, I believe we should support the old compromise package, which will enable us, among other things, to preserve regional winemaking cultures and traditions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that new rules of play are needed in the wine-making sector. European viticulture is the last part of our agricultural policy that is still not reformed and still works on the principle of ‘the higher the yield, the more money from Brussels’. This often leads to wine producers paying more attention to quantity rather than quality, which has not escaped our European customers. They are increasingly choosing wines from California, Chile or South Africa in preference to our Moravian, Czech, French or Italian wines. We should support quality and competitiveness. However, this must not involve discriminating against certain Member States while favouring others. If we really want to agree on a reform of the wine sector, it cannot include the proposed ban on the use of beet sugar for wine enrichment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Each of our countries has different climatic conditions and different traditions. The geographic environment of the countries situated in the more northerly parts of Europe is vastly different from that of the southern ones. Our colder climate often makes it necessary to enrich our wines with sugar. In my country sugar has been used for wine enrichment for over 200 years; it is a traditional method. The European Commission suggests banning sugar enrichment and substituting it with wine must concentrate instead. Concentrated wine must, if not subsidised, costs at least twice the price of sugar, besides which it is only produced by a few countries. If we were to use wine must concentrate or rectified must concentrate to enrich our wines, we would have to import it from other countries, which would contravene one of the basic principles of European viticulture, and that is defining the origin of the wine by the origin of the grapes. Apart from that it would raise the price of the wine and consequently make it less competitive on the market. That, in my opinion, would be discrimination. While the Commission objects to the sweetening of wines, nobody seems to be concerned about their souring, that is about the addition of tartaric acid, mainly in the southern European countries. I would like to raise a glass of honest wine to an honest reform without discrimination and favouritism.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you for the floor, Madam President. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of reforming the wine market is to encourage the production of acceptable, good-quality wines. We welcome the fact that the recommendation will continue to make it possible to increase the alcohol content with sugar in those areas where it qualifies as a traditional method. There are good wines in the new Member States, including Hungary, and we do not usually produce a surplus. If a wine is of good quality, it does not matter whether or not it was produced by adding sugar.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, modernisation and restructuring are necessary to make wines more marketable. The role of marketing and the provision of a larger national budgetary framework are particularly important in the interests of making investments to promote the change in structure, especially in the new Member States. It is for precisely this reason that we cannot accept the recommendation that historically based distribution should have a prominent role in the shaping of the national envelopes, which would lead to discrimination and mainly benefit the countries responsible for over-production.

      <p sl="sk">The European Union is a wine producer of global importance. By producing high quality wines it has secured a dominant position on the world market. However, as a result of globalisation, European wine production is facing the threat of cheap wine imports from the US, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Cheaper wines from third countries may bring joy to European consumers, but they are a headache for European producers. Due to their higher production costs, European wine producers will struggle in a fully open market and that is why we need to reform our wine sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">EUR 1.3 billion is allocated to the wine sector in the EU budget. We must use that money to take positive steps towards increasing the quality and attractiveness of our wines as well as for research and development of this sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Wine-growing in Slovakia has a long history and it has always been, and still is today, a difficult business. As wine merchants put pressure on producers to lower their prices, they in turn cannot afford to pay the growers adequate prices for their grapes. There is a legitimate fear that in their struggle for survival the wine growers will be lured by subsidies into destroying their vineyards. The danger is that vineyards will be destroyed in areas where no surplus wine is being produced.</p>
      <p sl="sk">To try and limit the grubbing-up to the South of Europe, where there are surpluses and they are being dealt with by subsidised crisis distillation, would be politically unfeasible, as would simply banning sugaring in the north of Europe. In Slovakia, as in Germany and also in Austria, there is a very long tradition of wine enrichment with sugar.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, who has taken such a balanced approach to a topic as emotive as wine. He has managed to negotiate a viable compromise, which takes into account all the different aspects of the wine sector. Above all he endeavours to reconcile the interests of all the producers, North and South. Only a good reform of the wine sector can help preserve the best wine-making traditions in the EU, strengthen social structures, and enhance the quality and attractiveness of our countryside, while protecting the environment. I am sure visitors to all the various wine-growing regions of Europe will appreciate and enjoy sampling the characteristic wines produced from locally-grown grapes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, yes, a reform of the COM in wine is desirable, but are the means put forward by the Commission the most suitable? From the Brussels viewpoint, we can understand the mathematical equation between a decrease in production and a decrease in the number of producers, but from the viewpoint of south-west France, the plains of Italy, the Spanish or Portuguese coasts, Commissioner, I can assure you that it is not the same thing, and this is an issue which should not be observed through the prism of the economist’s spectacles. Winemaking means men and women who live off the fruit of their labours. Vines are their livelihood, and we cannot push them towards the exit door without concerning ourselves as to what they will do for a living. Moreover, what is the logic in grubbing-up, on the one hand, and on the other suggesting the total liberalisation of planting rights as of 2013?</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second question is as follows: why eliminate this regulatory tool when we have no assurances as to how the market will evolve? If we really want to fight overproduction, I suggest we order illegal plantings to be grubbed up first. For you know as well as I do that there are quite a few of these in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also makes provision for a greater variety of measures accessible through the national support programmes. This is a good thing, because the Commission’s proposal on this point is extremely restrictive. I therefore regret the insufficiency of the section dealing with crisis prevention. We know how liable wine production is to yearly variations depending on weather conditions, and crisis prevention measures will only help to mitigate the fluctuations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to conclude by saying that I understand the rapporteur’s caution on enrichment, which is a sensitive issue, but it is regrettable that authorisation has not been proposed to combine additive and subtractive enrichment methods, which would allow producers to reduce their use of sucrose.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the rest of the report, the general approach appears to be going in the right direction, and I will support the rapporteur’s excellent work.</p>

I do not have enough time at this stage to go into details, and we have already had in-depth discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, so I am just going to leave you with quite a simple message with regard to the future of our wine reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is time to do a deal. I am quite sure that a reform will make a huge difference for our wine sector and it is time to do a deal because, as rightly mentioned here today, we see an increase in imports, we see an increase in production, but we see a reduction in domestic consumption. It is time to do a deal because we can spend the budget of the wine sector in a much more intelligent way or in a better way than we do today, in ways which will strengthen the sector and also make much more sense to the public and to the taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that a deal is within our grasp but, of course, I say as well that it must be the right deal. We live in the real world, and I have shown considerable flexibility over many of my original proposals, but I will not allow the proposal to be watered down so far that the end product loses all its taste and all its value. The compromise that we find must give us a reform worthy of the name and it must give us a real chance of achieving the goals that we have set for ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can strengthen the competitiveness of our wine sector, we can achieve a better balance between supply and demand and we can make a big improvement in the rules on labelling and many other issues. We can do all this in such a way that wine production remains a jewel in the crown of European agriculture, as very rightly said by Ms Herranz García today.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not the time to make excuses for inaction and watch emerging opportunities just slip through our fingers. Now is the time to set our wine sector firmly on the road towards new successes.

      <p sl="fr">The European Commission certainly finds it hard to abandon the stereotypical approaches it applies to all sectors indiscriminately. Wine cannot be treated like spare parts for cars or some other industrially manufactured product. It is a product that shapes regions, cultures and ways of life.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the COM reform is concerned, if it is necessary it must preserve European winemaking, not get rid of it or disfigure it. It must support the adaptation of wine producers – particularly the subsequent restructuring of sectors – and give them the means to reconquer the internal market. Nor should planting right restrictions be lifted. They provide a guarantee for control of production and continued quality. In relation to crisis management tools, if the EP improves the situation with respect to the Commission’s initial proposal, I can only regret that crisis distillation – which, if compulsory, would not create the excesses we are seeing now – is no longer an option among the possible instruments for handling temporary crises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for its efforts on this report and, of course, especially the rapporteur Mr Mulder and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know from various talks that Mr Mulder closely follows this topic, and my services and I have carefully assessed the different amendments that have been proposed. I have read with great interest the report drawn up by Mr Mulder. I really appreciate the strong, dedicated interest of both Mr Mulder and the European Parliament on this topic. I also appreciate the support that the rapporteur repeatedly expressed for cross-compliance in his report.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said several times, this system is right and necessary and it needs to stay if we want society to support our agricultural payments. I know that we are completely on the same line.</p>
      <p sl="en">I could broadly agree with the explanatory statement accompanying the amendments proposed in the report. In particular, I can endorse the call for having the simplest possible system without watering down its efficiency. I think we have fulfilled this objective to a large extent with the proposal concerning the control and the sanction system. Of course, we have the possibility and the chance to continue this work in our health check, where we will mainly focus on the scope of the application of the cross-compliance system.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the amendments tabled to our proposal for a Council regulation, we all have to keep in mind that the discussions were very lively in the Council. Our initial proposal has evolved and we now have a compromise text agreed by the Commission that is the result of intense discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Portuguese Presidency has, as far as possible, reflected in the compromise the ideas that you have been raising in the preparation of your report.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the concrete amendments to the legal provisions you are now proposing, I have to say that they are not relevant to the Council regulation we are discussing just now: a number of them concern the control rules that are under Commission competence and, as I said, the new Commission rules will soon be finally approved.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think Mr Mulder’s main concerns have been taken on board, and this is the case, in particular, for the improved flexibility that Member States will have to adapt the control system to their administrative organisation. We have also widely extended the possibility for prior notice of controls.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another set of Parliament proposals has been discussed in depth at the Council and the compromise reflects all those different opinions. It is a case of the possibility of getting rid of the 10-month rule – I think fixing a date is a much better idea – the follow-up for the de minimis and minor infringement cases, and the phasing-in of full cross-compliance for the new Member States applying the simplified system. We want to stick to this compromise text, which was intensively negotiated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we will take the opportunity to discuss your proposal to extend the period for the prolongation of the Single Area Payments Scheme (SAPS) system; we will have this opportunity within the discussion on the health check. As you might have noticed, I personally consider this a very good idea.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will be back for final comments.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, following the Commissioner’s introduction there is not really much more debate required, but I would still like to throw some light on the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The first element is cross-compliance. I do not know what it is called in other languages but we have adopted this word in Dutch. It is a familiar term amongst the farmers. We do indeed support this, as the Commissioner just said: it is an essential aspect of agricultural production and we think that this is defensible, because it sets requirements for agricultural production that go beyond what is necessary to ensure that the products from agriculture are fit for human consumption. We go beyond that with all kinds of Directives: Birds and Habitats Directives, environmental Directives, animal welfare standards, etc.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The big question in all this is: what form should the checks take? As far as the checks are concerned, I think that as we have more and more reforms it will be essential to have widespread support and understanding of the system of cross-compliance among farmers. If the methods are too bureaucratic, as they are at the moment, that will not be fostered. What could we change in this area?</p>
      <p sl="nl">First, there are too many controlling agencies in individual Member States at the moment and they also still visit on different days. We are convinced in this report that the number of controlling agencies should be kept to a minimum, that the checks should also be carried out on one day, and that the farmer should be given reasonable advance notice of the visit. How much notice should be given will be decided in the vote today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We also believe that there should be a de minimus provision for minor infringements, for petty transgressions: the authorities should not come down too hard in such cases. You cannot find fault with everything and besides farmers should never be punished twice for something that is covered by both European and national law That would mean paying two fines and we are against that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">An important point in the report – and I think that the Commission is also in favour of this – is that a great many things that are checked by the authorities under cross-compliance are also checked by private industry. Why should we have two inspection systems? Why is it not the case that if private industry checks something, then the public authorities say ‘fine, we will check the private industry schemes from time to time and if they are good, we do not need to carry out checks on the farms themselves any more’. That could make a huge difference, also from the farmers’ perspective. I think that could be an excellent form of cooperation with private industry.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To the Commission and Council, we are meanwhile in agreement on abolishing the 10-month rule. I think that the deadline for submitting applications in the Member States is a guide date for the application for support.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We in the Committee on Agriculture think it is reasonable that the new Member States should also be given extra time to adapt and we have said that if they eventually get 100% agricultural support payments, they must also observe the cross-compliance rules in full. We do not know what the future of the system will be but we do know that it is incredibly expensive at present.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Would it be possible for the Commission to produce a rough estimate of what it costs to implement it in each Member State, how the cost in one Member State compares with another and how it compares with the total expenditure associated with cross-compliance? This study could also come up with various options for how it could be done more cheaply through cooperation with private industries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At a rough estimate there are at present about 18 Directives that farmers have to comply with in order not to have their income subsidies cut. There may be more to come. There is a soil directive in preparation, for instance. The Commission should investigate whether it might not be possible to reduce the number, and I do have one or two Directives in mind.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is ridiculous that we have both a Nitrates Directive and a Groundwater Directive. The Groundwater Directive says that the permitted level of nitrates in groundwater is 50 mg per litre (if you exceed that, you are liable to penalties); the Nitrates Directive says 1.7 livestock units per hectare. We should have either one or the other, but not both. That is too much of a good thing. One of them must go, and I would say the Nitrates Directive.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her comments this morning and also Mr Mulder for his cooperation on this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last week an RTE television programme (which I once edited and presented) asked the very simple question, ‘How many inspectors does it take to examine a farm?’ In the case of one farmer, Eamon Healy of Redcross, County Wicklow, it took seven inspections and nine inspectors in a three-month period to examine his farm! And I think that, by any standards, that level of inspection is excessive and very unwelcome on a farm that is active and busy. I think it says a lot about the need to radically alter the way we carry out our cross-compliance checks on farms and also the need to streamline – as Mr Mulder said – the many different types of inspections, whether they are Member State or private industry, or EU-required.</p>
      <p sl="de">About 68% of cases of non-compliance are considered to be minor, yet they lead to sanctions, and I think we need flexibility around this. I believe that a sanction of less than EUR 250 should not be imposed. I know the Commission has other ideas, but I hope it will be persuaded by our arguments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over 70% of cases are around the loss of an ear-tag or some minor issue about identification, with no problems or risk to human health or animal health, and I think we need more flexibility around this particular problem. We need to be proportionate. I think we do need to give farmers advance notice. Many are part-time and giving them advance notice allows them to plan for an inspection. They cannot really alter much on the farm within a short space of time.</p>
      <p sl="de">So I think we need to be practical. I doubt very much if Eamon Healy, the farmer I just mentioned, is aware of our debate here this morning. I do not think he is logged on and listening. But I know he will be very keen to find out the outcome of our work and our vote. He does not want seven inspections or nine inspectors on his farm in a three-month period and he is telling us that we need to streamline how we do our work. I think we owe it to him and to other farmers to get on with it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to thank and congratulate Mr Mulder for his work, and also for his methodology and the various consultations he carried out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">His report on implementation of cross-compliance for agricultural aid has acknowledged a start-up phase in the application of this rather complicated system. The aim is to increase acceptance by all the main players. It recommends a distinction be made between matters arising from Community frameworks and those subject to national implementation. It stresses the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the regulations and demands adapted to risks and local requirements, but also the importance of a common framework guaranteeing European farmers equal treatment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This dual level of rules has made it extremely difficult to implement the system. Insufficient information has been provided for farmers; risk criteria have been used very infrequently; the management, control and reduction system is too complicated; insufficient consideration has been given to cases of minor non-compliance; control rates are not harmonised; prior notification of controls poses a problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Personally, I do not wish to question the spirit of cross-compliance, which provides a response to the legitimate expectations of our society: respect for the environment, traceability, food safety and transparency. On the other hand, I do wish to highlight the heavy burden of regulations, the difficulties involved in applying them on the ground and the negative perception some farmers have of them, in the belief that their professionalism and know-how are being questioned. I therefore wish to point out the need for simplification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was disappointed with the Commission proposals, which were very limited, and I hope that Parliament’s proposals will be taken over and that the Commission will come up with more ambitious suggestions during the Health Check.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to emphasise that I do not agree at all with the compensation logic that since European farmers are subject to strict production conditions (animal welfare, environmental concerns, veterinary practices) they should receive agricultural aid. Aid for agriculture would to a certain extent establish a fair playing field as regards competition with farmers in third countries who are not subject to the same production conditions. However, I feel that it is because farmers receive public aid that they should, in return, respect a number of production rules. There should be a genuine contract between farmers and the EU. We must somehow move from constraint to contract.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore pleased that my amendment on this matter was adopted and that, when the farmer makes his single application and declares the area used for agricultural purposes, he must also agree to comply with criteria relating to public health, animal welfare and respect for the environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The reductions in payments must differ depending on whether non-compliance is deemed an intentional act or the result of negligence. I was also keen for the sanction to be proportionate to the importance of the sphere of activity affected by the non-compliance at the farm, particularly where this is a mixed crop and stock farming holding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Farmers in the different Member States must also be obliged to observe the same rules, and therefore it is important to ensure harmonious transposition of the management requirements set out in the Directives. I also welcome the adaptation measures for the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, even though I support the introduction of a threshold above which the Member States may decide not to apply any reduction of direct aid, the de minimis threshold, I am totally opposed to raising this threshold to EUR 250, as proposed in Amendment 16. If this were the case, most infringements leading to a reduction in aid would not be sanctioned and the cross-compliance system for aid would make no sense. I therefore ask you to support Mr Mulder’s Amendment 31 proposing a threshold of EUR 100, a compromise I feel could be acceptable to all.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank our colleague Jan Mulder for his report today and for his methodology. I am glad our Parliament is looking into the cross-compliance mechanisms for CAP aid, which have demonstrated since the major reform of 2003 the limitations of a system whose rules are often too finicky, and have transformed the job of farmers into a kind of ad hoc official within the European administration, when they are actually carrying out a mission essential to mankind: feeding us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 2003 reform is an unmistakable step forward which ought to help our agricultural sector protect the environment and health, and it was in this spirit in 2005 that we voted in favour of the new EAFRD Regulation replacing the EAGGF – Guarantee section.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am taking part in the debate today as the permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds for the Committee on Budgets in order to stress – like many of my colleagues – how important it is to reduce excess bureaucracy in managing these funds. On the subject of the budget, I feel firstly that it is vital that all players in the agricultural economy and rural development, the main guarantors of environmental protection, reduce useless administrative burdens so that they can focus on their main activity, which is continuing to achieve the quality agriculture we expect, and environment-friendly agriculture at that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I would also like the controls to focus on two matters which are extremely useful in guaranteeing a suitable cost-profit ratio. I feel it is vital that the rules we make do not hinder use of the available credits for which we fight so fiercely at each round of negotiations with the Member States in the Council. It is not normal to see such under-use of appropriations at the end of 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I thus intend to vote for all these measures to the extent that they endeavour to reduce the administrative burden.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to express our support for Mr Mulder. The concern underpinning the report has been to ensure that the principle of cross-compliance and its associated controls do not penalise farmers unjustifiably.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Agriculture is not simply one more economic activity. It has a specific social role. Payments conditional on fulfilling many environmental requirements are not only beneficial to farmers but also to society as a whole. This broad social role of payments should constantly be emphasised. A significant sector of society is unaware of this role and it should be explained to them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to make a very important point. We require our farmers to abide by the principle of cross-compliance. We impose conditions on them. We should impose the same conditions on those who export their agricultural products to Europe. In particular, the requirements concerning animal welfare should be imposed on all imports without exception. Economic and humanitarian interests require this to be the case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, a word of thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur, who certainly took a great deal of trouble, even if the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did not adopt all of his proposals. I regret that. I do not intend to go into detail now but to say in general terms that the compulsory requirement is, of course, compliance with the law. The new feature, following the severance of the link between production volumes and aid, is that this compliance with the law is now the basis for the payment of premiums.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those who do not take the premiums cannot have their premiums cut. Growers need only refrain from applying. Nevertheless, they still have to observe the law. Mrs McGuinness, when you speak of seven inspections and nine inspectors – or vice versa – you should be taking up the cudgels with your own national government, for it is up to the Member States to determine how inspections are conducted, and if you have no coordination because numerous different administrative bodies are responsible for enforcing particular laws, and each authority sends its inspectors separately, thereby imposing endless burdens on farmers, that is not a matter for the EU but for your own national tier of government. Sort that out, and everything will be fine.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe there is an urgent need to make these funds conditional. At the congress, we heard someone say these were farmers’ funds. No, they are not farmers’ funds: they are granted to farmers. Do not misunderstand me: it is right that these funds should be awarded, but it is also right that society expects them to be given to those who fulfil certain conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have just had an inspection myself. Two people came, having announced their visit. Although they did not let me choose the time of the visit, they did announce it; they duly arrived, and it went very smoothly. Of course, Commissioner, these inspections should also be used to develop an advisory service to help farmers by informing them how best to comply with and apply the law on their farms.</p>
      <p sl="de">That, as you know, was set in motion back then on the initiative of Parliament, so the possibility exists. Please make it compulsory for the Member States, and then we shall be one step further forward.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, theoretically the common agricultural policy was meant to guarantee food safety, stability for EU production and prices, and also a decent income for all farmers. Unfortunately, in the name of the dogma of savage competition, CAP 2003 and its aid decoupling system constitute another step towards abandoning these objectives, even though they are vital European components.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Single payment entitlements contribute to the serious difficulties in sectors such as wine, milk, meat, beetroot, fruit and vegetables. The entitlements’ environmental cross-compliance principle is nothing more than a trick devised to sell this reform to Bohemians who pass themselves off as environmentalists merely because it is fashionable to do so. How can we possibly imagine it is possible to increase our protection of the environment by stimulating competition in the agricultural sector and bringing down the prices of foodstuffs at the same time? The two requirements are contradictory: it is impossible to combine lower production costs with an increase in environmental regulations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the same way, the immediate consequence of decoupling the premium for maintaining suckler cows would be the disappearance of the natural carbon-absorbing meadows, which are particularly effective in combating greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Protecting the planet and maintaining production of quality European beef mean that decoupling must be rejected. In a more general context, what we actually need is another agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the rapporteur’s explanatory statement is instructive in that it depicts cross-compliance as a condition for continued public support, and tells us that farmers are now being paid for ‘complying with Community legislation in the field of environment, public, animal and plant health and animal welfare’. It further states that such regulations are very strict compared with standards in the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">That neatly encapsulates everything that is wrong with the EU’s attitude to agriculture, with an aggressive regulatory regime diverting farmers away from their natural ambit of producing food and turning them into guardians of the environment, or what this report calls rural development policy, all of which adds mightily to their costs and reduces output. It has also had the effect of putting farmers into direct competition for funding with establishments such as country parks and wildlife preserves, which would not naturally be their competitors.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am aware that the intention of this proposal is to simplify cross-compliance, because it is openly admitted that it has created a heavy, bureaucratic burden for farmers and for Member States to enforce. It is my contention that it was a bad idea in the first place, and simplifying it is to merely administer a band-aid rather than a cure. As usual, in EU parlance, ‘simplification’ means more standardisation and more control by the Commission. Again, the major differences inherent in agriculture across the wide diversity of climates prevalent in the EU do not lend themselves to such standardisation. This report enthusiastically trumpets the view that cross-compliance is an important instrument in justifying public support for farmers. I doubt that even one per cent of the public would have heard of cross-compliance, never mind understand what it means. For real simplification, let us do away with cross-compliance altogether and let farmers get on with what they do best, which is to grow crops and rear animals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, farmers are not unreasonable people, nor, as a rule, are they dishonest, yet cross-compliance often treats them unfairly, with disproportionate penalties for minor offences and no-notice inspections. We have heard that 68% of all cases of non-compliance are classified as minor, yet the sanctions imposed are too often, for the struggling farmer, almost crippling. Disparity in how cross-compliance is administered from country to country compounds the resentments which it has built up in some.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my constituency of Northern Ireland, we have had a particular problem with duplicate fields, arising from our conacre system. Instead of a pragmatic search for a solution, we have had heavy-handed rigidity. Much of the blame lies with the local Department of Agriculture, but it, and Brussels, could each have done more to resolve that problem. So, going forward, my plea certainly is for simplification and flexibility, and a good dose of good, old-fashioned common sense to replace the inflexibility of some over-zealous mandarins.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to welcome the report today and congratulate the rapporteur on his work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cross-compliance and how it is implemented at Member State level are crucial. We must not allow each other – and each and every Member State – to make their own interpretation. If you listen to what Ms McGuinness and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said this morning, it shows the difference in interpretation in different Member States. We have got to get it right at Member State level, and we have got to insist that each Member State implement this directive in the right and proper way in each and every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Farmers need and require less inspection, not more. When inspection happens, there must be sufficient notice before inspection occurs. It is madness, in my opinion, to fine any farmer for the smallest detail; this is already happening. Farmers should be allowed a period to put right any problem that is identified, not just be told that they have defaulted and will be penalised. There is a great need to reduce bureaucracy and red tape in farming. Cross-compliance must not become a system that allows farmers to be penalised and policed. We should be there to help farmers and to offer advice on how they can do things better. Cross-compliance could be a force for good, and those who do the inspections should have clear and proper training and know their responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is right. I had an inspection at my farm which lasted seven hours. The only thing they could find wrong was that one little part of it was no longer considered to be arable land and we had built a poultry unit, which we did not inform them about. Now, really, an oversight as simple as that – building a poultry unit on your farm and not having informed them within the 12-month period – I do not think is something that you should actually be penalised for. You should be allowed to put it right at the earliest possible moment.</p>

I should like to emphasise the way in which these rules connect with our citizens, with consumers: we have here a very significant means of raising awareness about a subject as topical as environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="it">I endorse the rapporteur’s efforts to simplify conditionality: indeed, in my opinion it is counterproductive to demand excessive efforts of farmers to comply with legislation. By introducing new issues such as climate change, biofuels, water resources and risk management, the Commission has demonstrated its wish to move forward, even though some ambiguity still surrounds the way in which conditionality is to be handled, if it confines itself to laying down a generic requirement for simplification without clarifying how - and to what end - it is to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="it">Elements such as simplification, deregulation and - I myself would add - transparency must always underpin any initiative emanating from the European Union. I shall stop there but, Commissioner, I am aware that ten days ago you visited Brescia, in my own province, and - even if this is not quite germane to the current debate - you were able to taste the wines and typical products of Brescia: I believe that not adding sugar to wine is a means of striking the right quality balance and fairly rewarding producers.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, guaranteed EU support to farmers should be provided under the common agricultural policy for the years 2007 to 2013. And that is why I cannot accept that Commission should attempt to scale down this guarantee by means of its recently announced ‘Health Check’. The Commission is seeking to cut back the amount of direct payments to farmers to less than 13%. This breach of the guarantee is, to my mind, unacceptable because farmers have entered into set-aside arrangements for those years and it would not be right to go back on them.</p>
      <p sl="ga">As regards standards, what I would say is this: if they are to be enforced throughout the EU, they should apply equally to the food brought into the EU – and farmers all over Europe should not be subjected to pointless checks.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We should look at the standard applying to the food that we allow into Europe, and the Commission should take action, instead of bothering farmers, who are doing their best in all parts of Europe, and that certainly includes my country, Ireland.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our colleagues, rapporteurs and fictive rapporteurs, who undertook the difficult mission of presenting before us this package of complex amendments that are essential for the future of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is obvious that the very high number of European regulations and directives that farmers must observe renders their access to the aid schemes more difficult. The rules of the single payment system must be simplified as regards conditionality. The legal basis allows the application of the minimum rule for reduction of payments, as well as for exemptions from reduction in the case of minimum infringements.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Fewer administrative obligations, harmonized examinations, combination of examinations, including at the level of European institutions, and payments made in due time would improve the overall assistance provided to farmers, thus increasing the efficiency of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is also necessary to provide increased assistance for preparing inspections, which, in my opinion, should be announced with limited duration and performed by adequately trained people.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, as new Member States, I consider the extension of the optional nature of articles 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 until 2013 to be judicious, as far as the provisions of these articles refer to statutory requirements in matters of administration.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, all types of agricultural activity and production should comply with the requirements concerning environmental protection, safety, quality and animal welfare. Mr Mulder's report contains many important provisions in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would ask the Commissioner to focus in particular on four amendments, namely Amendments 19, 26, 27 and 29. If the cross-compliance system is to be properly implemented in the new Member States whilst also responding to society’s expectations, it will have to be introduced in stages.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The full range of requirements should only come into force in those countries in 2013, when they begin to receive full direct payments. We should bear in mind that the financial perspective 2007-2013 does provide resources to enable holdings to adjust and for investment. Commissioner, the requirements and standards imposed on our farmers are stricter than in third countries. We need to support our farmers and protect them from unfair competition. Imported products must comply with the same production process standards as Union products.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to thank the Members very much for all their contributions to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will know that cutting red tape, and making things more simple, have been at the top of this Commission’s agenda from the very beginning. That was why, when we opened this debate on cross-compliance, we commissioned from Rambøll Management a report on simplifying the CAP that was specifically linked to cross-compliance. It is a limited study which only covers five different Member States, but it is very interesting and I will supply you with a copy.</p>
      <p sl="en">It shows, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf rightly says, that there is a huge difference between Member States. The way in which the cross-compliance system is implemented in Member States is different. So, as was rightly said, the role of the advisory system is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we should use this study for further discussions, within the health check, on what we can do to simplify the cross-compliance system without watering down the ideas underlying it.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a first step, along with the discussion in Council and the Mulder report, but it is not the final step. Let us continue with the health check to see what might be done, and use all the available information. This report will be worth looking into to see what can be done, what Member States can do, and how Member States can define best practice among themselves, in order to find a solution in which there is a level playing field.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for the discussion. I am sure we will return to this matter again.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I welcome the postponement of implementation of the expensive requirements relating to cross-compliance for the new Member States (the so-called new Ten). This is certainly justified. The countries concerned are not yet receiving the full direct payments that already represent the lion's share of all expenditure on agriculture in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also welcome the extension of the possibility for the new Member States to benefit from Single Area Payments (SAPS) from 2010 to 2013. This will avoid placing a heavy and unnecessary burden on the new Member States in connection with implementation of the Single Payments System (SPS).</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is a move in the right direction, but we should not allow it to obscure the serious situation concerning the distribution of resources between the old and the new Member States. According to the most recent information available, dating from 2005, the new Member States have received EUR 1.5 billion in direct payments. This is 21 times less than the old Fifteen. The beneficiaries, however, only received 2.4 times less (EUR 2 million and EUR 4.9 million respectively). These enormous differences are also reflected in the average payments received by each beneficiary. For the new Member States it amounted to EUR 723, whereas for the old Fifteen it was EUR 6 327, which is almost nine times more!</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ongoing discrimination against the new Member States is detrimental to farmers in those countries. It also calls into question the very spirit of the common agricultural policy and the development of agriculture across the whole of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members for their support in the drafting of the report. I am delighted that it is unanimously being brought for a vote in plenary, but this cannot stop us from speaking out strongly against the recasting procedure which the Commission chose for this particular proposed directive.</p>
      <p sl="el">This report is very important because it aims to provide a sound basis for the distribution of fruit trees, so that they are certified and safeguarded in terms of plant hygiene in order to protect the farmer, the consumer and the environment. It is of paramount importance that the producer should be able to obtain healthy propagation material, both to prevent the spread of new diseases and to protect his income, and also to reduce the use of pesticides, which are, as we all know, so harmful to the environment. This is why we tabled a number of amendments.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let us not forget that with the enlargement of the European Union to 27 countries, the movement of goods became easier, simpler and free of red tape. This conceals dangers. We must be careful because the movement of plant products without inspections poses the risk of the spread of diseases, with disastrous consequences for the environment and for the economy.</p>
      <p sl="el">To conclude, I would like to reiterate my opposition to the recasting procedure, which prevents us from making improvements where we consider them necessary. I believe this policy is dangerous, especially if the Commission chooses it in future reforms of other proposed regulations and directives.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In this regard, however, we are taking the opportunity afforded by the report to transmit some very clear messages. The first is that we need to determine whether or not the idea of definite arrangements based on the country of origin is still the aim of the European Union. We also need to offer the Member States more flexibility in the use of lower rates for goods of basic necessity for social, economic, cultural and environmental reasons. We must also offer the Member States space to use lower rates in terms of political objectives.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, for almost two decades the European Parliament has been awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to men and women from all parts of the world who campaign for human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I am delighted to bid a very warm welcome today, here in the European Parliament, to the winner of the Sakharov Prize for 2007, Salih Mahmoud Osman.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">It also gives me great pleasure to extend my warmest greetings to his wife, Salwa Ahmed Faragalla Ali, who has always stood by his side at difficult times in his life. We welcome you among us.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">The decision to award the 2007 Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman was taken unanimously by the Conference of Presidents, which comprises the chairs of the political groups, on the basis of a proposal adopted by a large number of Members of the European Parliament from various groups. The European Parliament has thereby reaffirmed its solidarity with the people in Darfur and its conviction that a sustainable solution for that region can only be achieved through justice, democracy and respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The conflict that has plagued Darfur since 2003 is exacerbating the plight of a country devastated by more than twenty years of civil war. As with most conflicts, it is the civilian population who have suffered most from militia raids, the destruction of villages, scorched-earth policies and forcible displacements.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The conflict has claimed at least 400 000 lives and has been responsible for more than two and a half million displaced persons and refugees, notwithstanding the signing of the peace agreement in Darfur in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Just like the European Parliament, the winner of the 2007 Sakharov Prize does not simply accept this unjust situation but protests against the impunity of those who caused it. For years Salih Mahmoud Osman has been defending the rights of victims of the conflict in Darfur. Thousands of people who have been imprisoned without trial, tortured and exposed to death threats, who have been driven from their homes, displaced or subjected to sexual violence are familiar with the name of Salih Mahmoud Osman.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">His commitment is remarkable in several respects. In a country where violence is constantly on the increase, Salih Osman risks his life on a daily basis in the cause of human dignity and justice.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the name of human dignity, Salih Osman reassures those destitute, defenceless and intimidated men and women who have sunk into oblivion that the world is aware of their suffering, that they have not been forgotten and that they have reason to hope for a return to a perfectly normal and simply human life.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Since 2004, Salih Osman has been committing himself to the establishment and administration of the Amal Centre in Nyala, amal being Arabic for ‘hope’, for the rehabilitation of victims of violence and sexual abuse. In a predominantly Muslim country, Salih Osman is one of the few men who campaign actively in support of women’s rights and especially for recognition of the right to compensation for victims of sexual violence.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the name of justice, Salih Osman strives, day after day, to ensure that those responsible for war crimes are held to account both nationally and internationally. While the Sudanese judicial system still has many defects that make it unable to put an end to the prevailing climate of lawlessness within the country, international jurisdiction seems to offer an alternative.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The fact that the Sudanese authorities are refusing to hand over alleged war criminals to the International Criminal Court, however, highlights the limits of international justice and shows how much progress is still needed before the rule of law can be established in Darfur and throughout Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">That is why Salih Osman’s work is not confined to the legal aid he gives the victims. As a member of the Opposition in the Sudanese Parliament since 2005, he does not hesitate to affirm his convictions in the Sudanese political arena and to engage in efforts to bring about genuine reform of the legal system.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">At the meeting between the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament on the eve of last weekend’s EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon, I had the opportunity and the great pleasure to meet Salih Osman. I was immediately impressed by his strong personality and his unbending will to fight for human rights in spite of all the persecution and hostility to which he and his family have been subjected. I learned a short while ago that Ali and you have three children, who are also very much in our thoughts today.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In 2004 Salih Osman himself was imprisoned for seven months without being charged, and it was only when he went on hunger strike that he was released. Members of his family have been tortured and murdered or have had their houses set on fire by the militias.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote, ‘Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do ’. Salih Osman embodies that kind of will and determination, showing his courage in his daily struggle on behalf of his fellow human beings. He is an exemplary campaigner for greater respect for the rule of law in his region. Salih Mahmoud Osman, you have our firm support and our warm acclaim.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As you know, the European Parliament has always been particularly receptive to the suffering of the African peoples. Salih Osman is one of a number of African prizewinners to whom Parliament has given its support in past years and whom it continues to support. Nelson Mandela was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1988, Salima Ghezali in 1997, Dom Zacarias Kamwenho in 2001 and Hauwa Ibrahim in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Salih Osman, we congratulate you on your untiring work in this cause, in this spirit, and we hope that the recognition this prize brings might grant you strength and protection from year to year for as long as your struggle continues. We are at your side.</p>

      <p sl="en">Sudanese lawyer acting for the victims of the war in Darfur . − Mr President, thank you for this tremendous honour. This prize is awarded as a unanimous vote of the European Parliament – a fact which gives me great satisfaction, but more importantly one which gives me the opportunity to speak to you today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am a native of Darfur, born in Jebel Marra, which is a mountainous region located in the centre of Darfur State. I have worked as a lawyer in Darfur in Sudan for many years. I have been a victim of detention and torture because of my work. Members of my own family have been tortured and displaced by the militia in Darfur. For many years, in my work, I have represented thousands of people who needed my help in front of the Courts. I have seen thousands of people who have been tortured; I have seen hundreds of women and young girls who have been victims of sexual abuse; I have seen the four million who have been forcibly displaced from their homes and those two and a half million who are confined, as we speak now, in the camps around the cities of Darfur: Nyala, Al Fashir, Zalingi and Al Geneina.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UN Security Council has adopted several resolutions related to the situation in Darfur. Unfortunately, none of these has been implemented effectively. The victims feel disappointed. They are waiting to hear from you; from the people of Europe. Your leaders have been talking tough about the policies of the Sudanese Government in Darfur. But so far we have not seen any concrete steps to address the situation in a strong and targeted manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a representative of the victims of the conflict, today I have an unprecedented opportunity to speak directly to the leaders of Europe. The people of Darfur need the European Union to show a strong, united position regarding protection of innocent civilians. The people of Darfur ask you to protect them from the violence, killings and abuse they are forced to face on a daily basis. The people of Darfur want you to protect their children and women from acts of rape and sexual violence, which are being used as ‘weapons of war’. This protection can be made possible through the deployment of the UN-AU hybrid force. The involvement of international, and especially European, forces is imperative, even though the Government of Sudan may be unwilling to accept that at the present moment. But Europe has a role to play in putting more pressure on the Government of Sudan to facilitate the deployment of these troops and the protection of the people of Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, in Darfur, and in Sudan, I tell you there will be no peace without justice and without protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">Peace can also be facilitated by Europe. The European Union has a great responsibility to promote peace internationally. The leaders of Europe have the ability to lead the peace process also in Sudan. I ask you to increase your efforts in bringing the rebel groups and the Government of Sudan to the table of peace negotiations as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the fact is that rebel groups are splitting among themselves, and this does not help the situation in Darfur. I want you to think about taking on board other stakeholders: the millions of victims who are voiceless in the camps and other, directly affected people of Darfur. Take on board also the civil society movement, NGOs and community leaders. That would help the situation in Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even if we can provide protection and promote peace in Darfur, justice and accountability must not be compromised by any political deal. Presently, none of the victims can return to their houses or homes, because of the absence or lack of security. Not only are our communities being attacked by militias, but even helicopter gunships of the Government of Sudan are destroying our villages in aerial bombardments. Despite these serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice, because the Sudanese judicial system is incapable, incompetent and unwilling to provide justice. All the perpetrators are beyond the reach of our domestic justice. This conflict is one which is marked by a culture of total impunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a lawyer, and a native of Darfur, I know that there can never be a lasting peace in the region without justice. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has made some important and significant steps in promoting accountability. Yet, the cycle of impunity has not yet been broken. The people of Darfur ask you to support the work of the ICC. The ICC is the most competent international criminal tribunal which can make the many notorious perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable for their actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Right now, the two identified suspects Kosheib and Haroun are still beyond the reach of justice. The Government of Sudan is insisting that it will never hand them over to the ICC.</p>
      <p sl="en">Darfur is not the only region of Sudan which suffers from abuses of human rights. Indeed, citizens from every part of Sudan face daily restrictions on their freedom of expression, freedom of association and other basic rights that many people in Europe take for granted. I urge you, also, to encourage and promote the rule of law in my country, so that all citizens of Sudan can enjoy their individual and collective rights. In the light of the upcoming elections in 2009, we must ensure that free and fair elections take place, and that a free and fair result will be respected by all sides.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I would like to thank you, the Members of the European Parliament, who came to Sudan in June of this year to see with your own eyes what I have described. This was a visit coordinated by the office of the European Commission in Khartoum. The office of the European Commission has been a source of great support and a partner to me in my work for many years now. The recognition of the European Commission and of you, the European Parliament, for the work of human rights defenders in Sudan gives us the courage and determination to continue to speak for the victims, and relieve some of their suffering.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I am proud to accept this honour on behalf of the other candidates to this prize: the Russian journalist assassinated last year, Anna Politkovskaya; the Chinese dissidents, Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia; and the Afghani MP and women’s rights activist, Joya Malalai, and also on behalf of so many Sudanese who believe – as I do – in human dignity and the pursuit of justice.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Costa on amendment of the agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on certain aspects of air services. This relates to a proposal for a Council decision on agreeing a Protocol amending the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on certain aspects of air services to take account of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Romania.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Protocol provides for essential changes to bilateral agreements on air services between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Romania pursuant to the accession of the latter two countries to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Both Bulgaria and Romania had previously concluded agreements on air services with Morocco, in 1966 and 1971 respectively. The European Community, however, concluded a horizontal agreement in December 2006. It is therefore necessary to adjust the agreements to Community legislation and enable both new Member States to accede to the horizontal agreement.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Romanian Members of the European Parliament from the Group of European Socialists abstained from voting on the report regarding the agreements between the EC and Georgia, Lebanon, Maldives, Moldova, Singapore and Uruguay on certain aspects of the air services due to the reference, in the text of the Agreement with the Republic of Moldova, to the Moldavian language in the phrase “Concluded in Luxembourg in two counterparts in the Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish and in the Moldavian language”.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The delegation of Romanian Social Democrats emphasizes that Romania’s participation in this agreement does not involve the acknowledgment of the designation of “Moldavian” language. The Romanian Members of the Group of European Socialists reiterate that, in compliance with the factual and scientific evidence, including the interpretation of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Moldova (of September 1994), the correct designation is the Romanian language.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is necessary to take into consideration the fact that, in many other agreements, the Commission has used the neutral wording “Concluded at … in … day of … of the year … in two counterparts in each of the official languages of the Parties, each text having equal legal power”.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We regret the fact that this wording was not used in the agreements with the Republic of Moldova and recommend the use of this neutral wording in the official documents regarding the EU relationship with the Republic of Moldova.</p>

      <p sl="en">Briefly I want to raise through my support of this report the problems still being experienced by EU airlines in regard to rights to fly over Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">These rights are not only restricted by the Russian authorities but they are also expensive, issued in a discriminatory way, and in a manner that clearly disadvantages EU carriers, particularly those flying a number of routes to the Far East.</p>
      <p sl="en">This problem has been known about for some considerable time but the unwillingness of the Russian authorities to renegotiate with the EU on this issue has been both expensive and unhelpful.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now need the Commission and the Russian authorities to reinvigorate their efforts to find a solution to this very serious problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Even though various reactor accidents occurred many years ago, we are still paying the price of past mistakes. Immediately after nuclear accidents, things like game, berries and mushrooms are temporarily removed from our menus, only to reappear after a short while. It is important to set restrictive maximum permissible levels, but there is still a shortage of studies on the effects of radiation on humans, just as the emerging field of genetic engineering has been insufficiently researched.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU must devote itself without delay to these important and urgently awaited impact studies, make preparations for the abandonment of nuclear energy and leave it to the Member States to take their own decisions on the use of genetic engineering. Since the aforementioned points were not adequately addressed in the report, I abstained.</p>

      <p sl="en">The common organisation of the market in fisheries products is intended to ensure stability in the market and security of income for those involved in the sector. These aims and, indeed, the aims set out in the EC Treaty are worthy and should have led to prosperity in Europe’s fishing communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately the past two and a half decades of centralised Brussels control in the form of the CFP have been disastrous for those communities. A thriving market with job security are not achievable within the context of the CFP and control of fisheries management must be returned to the nations dependent on fisheries.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I voted against the report because it deals with provisions for the common agricultural policy, which we want to abolish. The common agricultural policy needs to be radically reformed, and for a few years now we have been calling for a discussion to start as early as possible. We think that the EU should already start to cut back on agricultural support in 2010, after the so-called health check on the long-term budget for 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is why the Junilistan Members are usually unable to vote for the various reports on agriculture which come before the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="el">Plant hygiene and the certification of propagation material for fruit-bearing plants and fruit trees are of the highest importance for the producer because the initial establishment of an orchard, when properly accomplished, is a guarantee of good produce. Undoubtedly the legislation needs to be adapted to developments in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, although we agree with most of the amendments to Mr Gklavakis’s report, we have reservations and disagree with those amendments which accept genetically modified propagation material, even as rootstock, because it poses risks to human health and the environment. As yet there are no scientific studies guaranteeing that there are no effects. As regards imports from third countries, we agree that there should be no deviations because there are risks of the spread of pathogens in the European Union, with repercussions on production, product quality and agricultural income.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We defend the application of the principle of subsidiarity. As a result, we agree that the Community should not impinge upon Member States’ competence. This is the case, for example, with locally supplied services which do not involve cross-border activities and therefore have, in principle, no effect on the functioning of the internal market. As a result, in the area of indirect taxation and as regards the setting of VAT rates, each State must be totally free to act.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Even if the Council decides on a definitive system for the taxation of intra-Community transactions, Member States should be able to apply reduced rates or possibly even zero rates to goods and services which meet basic needs, such as food and medicines, and also to locally supplied services, including services and provision of goods linked to education, welfare, social security work and culture.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Even if a definitive system for the taxation of intra-Community transactions is decided by the end of 2010, Member States should be able to apply reduced VAT rates in order to reinforce the existence and maintenance of locally supplied services as well as their role in the formal economy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For once we were tempted to vote in favour of a report on VAT by this Parliament. It favours abandoning the aim of definitive arrangements based on taxation in the country of consumption, and this objective alone justified the increased harmonisation of rates. It also favours applying the principle of subsidiarity, which would allow the Member States to apply zero VAT to services provided locally, such as catering or other aspects, as a solution to social, educational and cultural aims etc. It also seeks to maintain many derogations which should have terminated in 2007 until 2010. We agree with all this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we cannot agree with the desire to maintain European legislation on VAT and the wish to secure identical rates whatever happens, in the name of simplification of trade and customs formalities for intra- EU trade. Taxation is a sovereign responsibility of individual countries, and the disparities concerning one type of tax often offset inequalities in another. They are not, therefore, always illegitimate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the context of the ongoing debate on transitional VAT rates, the European Parliament was asked for its opinion regarding extension of the temporary provisions concerning these rates. We are today voting on this opinion. It somewhat belated, as we are aware that the European Union has decided to continue applying preferential VAT rates after 1 January 2008. Nonetheless, I believe this is a very important opinion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It certainly is the right decision for the countries that joined the Union in 2004, and we fully endorse it. Parliament's opinion on the subject is unambiguous and advocates retaining certain temporary provisions concerning VAT rates. The decision merits broad support.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the van den Burg report on VAT. The report highlights the importance of the subsidiarity principle in taxation matters and, correctly I believe, states that the principle should apply where services have no cross-border element and accordingly have no impact on the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Commission can never get it right on the subject of VAT. In the 1980s the Cockfield Report called for a range of VAT rates. In fact, there was only a minimum rate of 15%, 5% as the normal rate and the lower rate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then the European Commission wanted VAT at the rate applied by the country of origin. In practice VAT was levied at the rate applied by the country of destination. It was a provisional system that became a definitive system: the so-called ‘Bolkenstein VAT’ was not introduced. There were now lower rates of VAT for French catering entities, CDs and activities generating a workforce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission gave in at least provisionally in its list in Annex H to the Sixth Directive in 1977, because it realised that Germans could hardly drive their Mercedes to a cross-border lunch at the low-VAT restaurant.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What a shame it did not realise in 1993 that with no border controls intra-Community VAT was an inexhaustible source of large-scale fraud. The philosophical logic of VAT, an intelligent tax since it is economically neutral, is inaccessible to the vast majority of Commission officials. That is why their legislation has failed constantly on this issue for the past 20 years.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to draw attention to the two amendments that I proposed and that have been approved in the final report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first proposal states that every country should have the right to apply reduced rates of VAT or, in exceptional circumstances, possibly even zero rates to basic goods and services, such as food and medication, for social and environmental reasons and for the benefit of the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second proposal states that it should be possible to apply reduced or even zero rates of VAT to goods linked to education, social security and culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">At present, reduced rates of VAT can already be applied to goods linked to education. This amendment reinforces this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Our abstention on this report is due to the doubts surrounding the establishment of ARTEMIS, its functioning and its management. The formation of joint undertakings in the context of public-private partnerships, as is the case with the establishment of ARTEMIS in order to implement a Joint Technology Initiative, as set out in this report, includes the idea of using public funds for private purposes and interests, whereas cooperation in the other direction, either financial or involving the transfer of knowledge, seems to be absent.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, the objectives seem to be contradictory as the private initiative pillar is founded on the accumulation of profits whereas the public service pillar is founded on the service of public interests and on the response to the concerns of the population.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, investment in research, particularly in the area of integrated IT systems, is a contribution which we regard as essential for the development of technology in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ARTEMIS is the first of four proposed joint undertakings with a joint aim and justification. The others are Clean Sky, ENIAC and Innovative Medicine. All four enterprises even have a joint headquarters in Brussels, which remains a joint capital for the Fleming and Walloon peoples.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Parliament's Committee on Budgets expressed its support for the four new institutions provided for under the Seventh Framework Programme. It did so in the hope that the public-private partnership model devised for them will prove more realistic than was the case for the Galileo Programme. It should be noted, however, that the time frame and budgetary arrangements for ARTEMIS and the other joint undertakings (2008-2013) are not in line with standard financial arrangements laid down in the seven-year financial perspective 2007-2013. This could give rise to certain problems in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We also noted the relatively low figure allocated to administrative costs in the breakdown of total expenditure on the four joint undertakings, namely EUR 84 million for the years 2008-2017. This represents around 3.5% of the total expenditure and substantiates our concerns. The question of proliferation of institutions within the framework of the European Union remains open, however, and does not only involve the institutional reconstruction of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Innovative Medicines Initiative is a unique initiative instigated by the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, which will have a budget of EUR 2 billion to 2013. That is why I also voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I am one of the critics of the lack of cooperation between large corporations and universities and I also object to the low level of resources available for research within the EU, due to the fact that, compared with the US, only one third of funding here comes from the private sector. Today at last we are sending very good news from Strasbourg to the European research industry by adopting a seven-year plan for innovative medicine at the cost of EUR 2 billion. The format of this undertaking is innovative in itself as it represents a partnership between the private and public sectors. This can double the available resources and also helps to unify research targets. I believe it will give a fresh impulse to knowledge management, education and vocational training. I am convinced that we can reverse the trend of falling efficiency in the European pharmaceutical industry and achieve a more easily accessible high-quality treatment, especially of cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. I would like to thank the rapporteur for getting the report to its successful second reading.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In my capacity as rapporteur I am very pleased with the adoption of this report on setting up an Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Implementation of this public/private partnership between the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries’ Associations (EFPIA) and the European Commission represents a major promising step forward for large-scale research programmes. The European Commission is duty bound to consider European needs from another angle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The IMI will have a total budget of EUR 2 billion between 2008 and 2013. The European Commission’s contribution of EUR 1 billion will be disbursed to SMEs and universities. In return, major companies will match this amount with a contribution in kind. They will involve the SMEs and universities by providing them with tools and methodologies to better predict the harmlessness and effectiveness of medicines, intelligent infrastructures and knowledge management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This cooperation between leading businesses, small-scale research centres, SMEs and universities will help fashion their research projects. IMI will also make improvements to knowledge transfer at universities and in business, and to the involvement of smaller companies in European research.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The subject of innovative medicines is particularly close to my heart, because I am actively involved in Poland with helping children suffering from rare genetic diseases. Unfortunately, these children are not covered by any health insurance programmes, and the medicines they require are too expensive. In most European countries, the cost of the medicines needed to keep such children alive and give them the opportunity to live near-normal lives is refunded.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a Member of the European Parliament, I realise how important a European approach to the whole issue of medicines is. I refer to innovation, Union support for research and for scientists, and also to Union encouragement of pharmaceutical concerns, urging them to develop new medicines. In my opinion, the report by Mrs Grossetête is very important indeed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree that the Union must change to a new and more effective method of managing research and innovation aimed at promoting the economic development of our continent, bringing relief to our citizens and even saving their lives in some cases. The European Commission's proposal to create joint technology initiatives will harmonise and simplify project financing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">With regard to research programmes on innovative medicines, it is important to involve SMEs, universities, patients, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry, to ensure that medicines are safer, cheaper and more readily available. The public-private partnerships proposed by the Commission are therefore an excellent solution. They represent a new option for the pharmaceutical research sector.</p>

      <p sl="de">The case of Muhammad the teddy bear has brought home to us once again how easy it is to get into a tight spot in a foreign country. It does not always take a natural disaster, an accident or the loss of a passport; a cultural misunderstanding can be enough. We still have a great deal to do in this area. In Turkey, for example, an applicant country for accession to the EU, life can be dangerous for Western travellers, since – as a very recent study demonstrates – the oft-proclaimed improvement in the protection of minorities exists only on paper, and the situation on the ground has actually deteriorated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two things, therefore, need to be done. The first is to establish a sound network of diplomatic missions that can serve our citizens as an anchor, and the second is to ensure that the travelling public are not only aware of an ambassador’s responsibilities but also know that they can seek assistance from the embassy of any EU Member State.

      <p sl="pl">On 11 September 2007 the Belgian police beat up and arrested Mr Borgheio, a Member of the European Parliament, in front of the European Parliament's building even though he identified himself as an Member of the European Parliament and informed the police about his parliamentary immunity. This incident shows that it is not necessary to seek out third countries to appreciate that the protection provided is not as good as it could be, even in the case of parliamentarians. I believe we should first deal with the situation in our immediate vicinity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This seventh Amending Budget for the year 2007 includes a further EUR 4 324.8 million in revenue and also a decrease of EUR 1 651.4 million in expenditure, thus allowing the Member States to reduce their contributions to the Community budget by around EUR 5 976.2 million.</p>
      <p sl="pt">While the increase in revenue is largely due to the VAT and GNI balances, budgetary under-implementation is mainly responsible for the significant reduction in expenditure, with the cuts essentially affecting the headings of cohesion, fisheries, environment and agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The late adoption of many operational programmes of the Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period (and others) is the justification given by the Commission and by the Council for not using the appropriations forecast for 2007. However, these amounts are not transferred to the 2008 budget to respectively boost the appropriations for these policies. It is noted that the amounts forecast in the 2008 Budget for these headings are within those agreed in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The non-implementation of these amounts in the Community budget is very worrying and should be very closely monitored given that 2007 is the first year of the new financial framework 2007-2013 and that Rule N+2 is still being applied in relation to the previous financial framework within which the appropriations must be fully used by 2008.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The provisions of this document are very relevant to modern Europe and should be introduced as a matter of urgency. They refer to the tools with which to create a new generation of working environment in customs and trade. I refer to the establishment of a paperless environment, which is so necessary mainly to relieve our officials, who are reeling from the demands of unnecessary administrative paper documentation. We should also keep in mind issues pertaining to environmental protection and the quantities of trees that have to be sacrificed to meet the demand for paper required for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I consider the introduction of electronic customs systems to be particularly important and urgent. I also advocate the creation of ‘Single Window’ and ‘One-Stop Shop’ facilities.

      <p sl="en">We are now confronted with a serious problem of trying to control the immense volume of imported goods, mainly from Asia. Solving this problem requires customs systems that are electronic and interconnected. Electronic trade and customs have already become a necessity for an efficient European market, even prior to the introduction of the modernised customs code. I would like to point out that we also need a system capable of intercepting goods which do not conform to the European safety standard and preventing such goods from entering the EU. The text we adopted today will provide for much more effective control of imports. It also has the advantages of a single window and a one-stop shop, which will provide access to information on international transactions not only for customs authorities but also for suppliers, buyers and hauliers. No doubt this system will also be used by the national supervisory bodies responsible for controlling the safety of goods on the market. The Commission has slowed down the implementation of the system into three stages to be introduced in 3, 5, and 6 years. I am afraid, however, that much faster action is needed and I hope that the Commission will soon be pressurised to revise its decision.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Today we adopted the recommendation for second reading on the common position establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Bearing in mind the economic, social and environmental aspects, it seems fairly important to have a policy for the marine environment with the necessary cooperation and coordination between the various countries, while all retaining their full sovereignty over their territory and resources. However, the central issue is respect for the sovereignty of the Member States, particularly over their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and their capacity to adopt independent measures to protect their resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a result, we cannot forget that the proposed ‘Reform’ Treaty contains a clause which aims to give the European Union exclusive competence for the management of marine resources within the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Furthermore, it must also be taken into account that marine pollution and intensive maritime transport impact on fishing activity and the protection of marine resources. Fishermen are therefore the first to be interested in protecting and regenerating marine resources. As a result, measures to ensure recovery of stocks must include measures with adequate financing in order to offer economic and social compensation to the sector and its workers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The marine environment hosts vital resources and its ecosystem provides essential services such as climate regulation and oxygen production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Policies concerning maritime transport, fishing, energy or even tourism have evolved separately, occasionally leading to failures, inconsistencies or usage conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A more global approach was necessary, taking account of all aspects of a sustainable development policy for Europe’s marine environment.</p>

Central control from Brussels is no way to manage the seas and oceans of Europe and the wider world.

Even though the administrative obstacles have been largely removed, we are still left with some very real technical obstacles.

In order to create a European area of transport without borders which genuinely encourages the free movement of people and goods, we must create the necessary conditions so that a journey from Lisbon to Helsinki is viable on all modes of transport.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Rail transport must be able to develop as a fully fledged partner in order to achieve the objectives of the common transport policy. We cannot forget that this is a safe and environmentally friendly means of transport that enables the transport of large quantities of goods and passengers.

However, there is another aspect to this matter and that is the through-running of trains from the continent and the opportunities this might give illegal migrants. The report aims to boost the free movement of trains through the removal of technical and operational barriers. There is no consideration of the security aspects.

      <p sl="el">The simplification and reduction of bureaucracy is desirable, but here it is being used as a pretext for more policing of farmers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Multiple conformity is therefore an extremely hypocritical notion because it knowingly overlooks substantial issues relating to the environment and public health, such as GMOs, and places particular emphasis on matters of only minor importance.

      <p sl="el">Overall, multiple compliance, without any substantial benefit to the environment, public health or the health of animals, for which purposes it was supposedly introduced, has placed a heavy financial burden on farmers and stock breeders. In our country, the costs of compliance for livestock facilities are intolerable for goat and sheep farmers, with negligible benefits for the environment, public health and the health of animals, although these are areas where the problems can be dealt with effectively if production methods are suited to the physiology of animals and plants. If, for example, a ban is placed on GM crops, meat meal, mineral oils and hormones, and systematic checks are carried out for pesticide residues in agricultural products, then the results for public health and the environment will indeed be much better.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0492/2007) by Kyösti Virrankoski and Ville Itälä, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2008, amended by the Council (all sections) and on Letters of Amendment No 1/2008 (13659/2007 – C6-0341/2007) and No 2/2008 (15716/2007 – C6-0435/2007) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2008.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as rapporteur I would like to warmly thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Böge. It is to his merit that the outcome, following conciliation, is so well-balanced. I would like also to thank Mr Virrankoski, my fellow rapporteur, for his great cooperation during the budget procedure. I am especially glad that Mr Virrankoski made possible the pilot projects in support of the sustainability of the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">My main objective as rapporteur for the budgets of Parliament and the other institutions was to keep any increase as low as possible. That is why I named this budget ‘the taxpayers’ budget’. That objective has been achieved, and the increase has been kept to below 4%.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I just wish to remind everyone that paragraph 48 in the motion for a resolution concerns Article 29 of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament. The administration has requested, regarding this, that we should send a letter to all the governments of the Member States, asking how they want Members to proceed if they are re-elected with regard to the Statute for new Members. I hope that my amendment concerning this gets through and that this matter gets dealt with via the quaestors, because that is the right way to go about this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As there has also been a public debate on this issue, I would like to say that this Article 29, decided by the Council, means that the governments of the Member States take a decision whether to apply the old rules or the new rules to re-elected Members. It is not the case that Members themselves are free to make this choice. Moreover, because this is a matter for the quaestors, it is only right that they should also decide whether to send this letter.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the grand total for the European Union’s budget for next year is EUR 129 149 700 000 for commitments and EUR 120 346 800 000 for payment appropriations. Although this is an increase of 5.71%, the payments are just 0.96% of GNI, i.e. EUR 9.3 billion under the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Parliament’s unconditional priority has been heading 1: sustainable growth and competitiveness. Parliament did much to promote financing for the two-year project for the Galileo Positioning System and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. In this we succeeded. The Council agreed to a revision of the multiannual financial framework so that the Galileo project might be financed entirely out of the EU’s budget. There was a gap in the financing of EUR 2.4 billion when the private sector pulled out. Parliament insisted on the gap being filled with money from the EU’s budget. There was no longer any question of carrying on in this vague and fragmented way. A choice had to be made in this budgetary procedure: either to continue with all the resources needed or end it immediately.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Fortunately for Europe, the Council chose to continue. For this we are grateful to the skilled work of the Portuguese Presidency. For the funds needed we took EUR 1.6 billion from this year’s unused agriculture expenditure, and EUR 200 million from the flexibility instrument, and the rest we obtained by prioritising and reallocating expenditure from heading 1a. Rescuing the Galileo project was a huge victory for Parliament in this budgetary procedure.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another significant achievement was the promotion of the EU’s external actions. For that, EUR 70 million was obtained from the flexibility instrument. All this is needed for such operations as preparations for the police service in Kosovo and the continuing difficult challenges concerning Palestine, and getting ready to launch these operations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Committee on Budgets has created a special reserve to boost activity-based management. This is something which will be returned to in the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A particular problem is management of the Structural Funds. More than half the operative programmes are still unapproved. It is important that they should be approved right away.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I wish to thank in particular the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency for their excellent work. The same goes to Commissioner Grybauskaitė for her constructive approach and initiative. I also want to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Böge, all the coordinators and all Members. My thanks also go to the office holders on the Committee on Budgets and those in my own group, who were able to produce good results in drawing up the budget under all the pressure of a tight schedule.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With these words, then, I leave the budget for Parliament to deliberate upon in its plenary session.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be taking part in your debate on the second reading of the budget for the year 2008. I have listened carefully to the first two speeches and should like to express my thanks for the words of praise on our joint work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As usual, the budget procedure for 2008 was extremely complex and I am delighted to note your intention to fully respect, in the budget for 2008, the agreement reached between our two institutions at the budget conciliation meeting on 23 November 2007. This agreement had two different but equally important objectives: firstly, to define the framework for establishing the budget for 2008 in order to allow the European Union to function properly and its policies to be correctly implemented; secondly, to ensure the financing of Galileo, one of the most important projects undertaken by the European Union in recent years on a political, industrial and financial level. In this context, please allow me to express my great pride at the leadership role played jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as budgetary authority, with the support of the Commission, in the overall agreement reached on the Galileo project.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On 23 November 2007 we managed to reach agreement on a Community budget consistent with such a vital project, thereby speeding up the approval of all its other legislative and technical aspects. This financing decision was undoubtedly a decisive step in launching the Galileo project towards its final orbit.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In addition, I should like to express the Council’s satisfaction at the agreement that we have reached on the budget for the common foreign and security policy for 2008. This is an extremely important political priority for the European Union. Also, I believe that the budget for 2008 as a whole represents a balanced compromise between, on the one hand, the need to ensure the necessary budgetary discipline and solid financial management and, on the other hand, our duty to meet the expectations of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Please allow me to add that this satisfactory result was only possible thanks to the synergy between the efforts of all those involved and the excellent and constructive climate which, in our opinion, characterised this whole process from the start.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a result, I could not end my speech without taking advantage of this opportunity to personally thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Reimer Böge, for both his frankness and the spirit of dialogue that he showed during the negotiations, and also the two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, for their constructive interinstitutional cooperation. I also want to express my gratitude to my colleagues on the ‘Budget’ Council, and to all those who cooperated with them, for the firm support that they gave the Presidency. My special thanks go to Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaite who fully played her role as neutral mediator and, last but not least, I should also like to thank the staff of the three institutions who took part in these negotiations for their very valuable and professional contribution. Thank you very much to everyone.</p>

    <intervention id="2-217" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dalia Grybauskaitė" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of Commission. –  Member of Commission">
      <p sl="lt">Congratulations to everyone. I would like to remind you that during the presentation of the draft general budget 2008, the European Commission allocated the biggest share of expenditure to investments in the development of economic growth. This is an unprecedented case in European financial history, when finances allocated to the development of economic competitiveness constitute the biggest share of the budget.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This is a new, historic quality of the EU budget and it reflects the EU’s political priorities – competitiveness, economic growth, cohesion and social harmony.</p>
      <p sl="lt">A significant element in negotiations on the 2008 budget was the need to make a decision on two innovative trans-European projects – the GALILEO project and the development of the European Institute of Technology.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The budget negotiations have been really complicated. However, the constructive position taken by both the European Parliament and the Commission have enabled positive results to be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to thank the European Parliament and especially the budget rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, for having considered the Commission’s explanations regarding certain reserves. At first reading these reserves for appropriations were lifted. However, I would like to point out that there still are several outstanding problems that the Commission has drawn Parliament’s attention to.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, there are still some reserves that will make budget implementation more difficult and complex, and I hope that they can be lifted as early as possible.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Two reserves are a specific source of our concerns, and I would like to draw the attention of the plenary to them. One reserve reduces by EUR 17 million the preparation for staff salaries at headquarters in the policy area of external actions, and that would force the Commission to leave posts vacant and to block recruitment from the beginning of January. This means, in fact, that there would be EUR 22 million in the combined reserve on staff salaries, and I really hope that Parliament will be able to reconsider its position on this in the plenary session.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As regards the general reserve for EUR 5 million on staff salaries, the Commission is firmly committed to delivering the required study on the ABM implementation and the reports requested by Parliament on the follow-up or the screening exercise and on the implementation of Article 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, regarding the requested action plan on the reorganisation of the coordination and support activities, I want to be very clear on behalf of the Commission. The European Parliament will be fully informed of all different steps in the follow-up to the screening exercise. On this we can give you the Commission’s commitment. However, I also want to stress that the Commission cannot launch a major reorganisation exercise during the last year of this Commission and, therefore, there will be no action plan in this regard. Major organisation can only be decided by the next Commission.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The Commission is committed to implementing progressively the results of the ongoing assessment of the number of activities identified in the screening. We are moving on a step-by-step approach. We have started working on the communication activities, the delegation network, the balance and the category structure of the Commission’s establishment plan. This we promised, and we will deliver.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We hope that Parliament will take into account our commitments and our capabilities to deliver in this matter and, during the vote on Thursday, will reconsider its proposals.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to finish by thanking the European Parliament, especially the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Böge, and the budget rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, as well as the Council, especially Mr Santos, for their very efficient cooperation and their constructive role. I do hope that today’s discussions will prove useful and fruitful and that they will contribute to the results of the vote on the European Union’s budget for 2008.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this 2008 budget is a good result and for that I must compliment my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets, especially our chairman, Mr Böge, and our two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, who I think have done an extremely good job. Like the Commissioner, I believe that this budget reflects more adequately the changing priorities of the Union today and it is more appropriate to the challenges which we face.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the fact that it represents 0.96% GNI and I am also happy to see that the funding for Frontex is much more appropriate to the challenge that this organisation faces.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are, however, two areas of concern. My first area is Galileo and, while it is not for me to comment on the technical merit of this project, I can and I certainly must comment on the financial disciplines which I see imposed. It was of concern to me that the private sector appeared to show a very low appetite for investment in this project. It would appear to me that there is little or no provision for cost and time overruns with the project, which are almost inevitable, and it does concern me that the vision for the business model after the development phase leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point which I want to mention is that this budget falls under the shadow of the Court of Auditors’ report. I have to say that, after 13 failures, this is something which must be taken very seriously. It is something which is extremely damaging to the public perception of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two points are absolutely clear. I make my points here to the Presidency, the Member States and the Commission. They must give greater urgency to achieving a positive DAS because – I repeat my words – it is very, very damaging to the perception of the Union. Secondly, and on that point, I believe it is time for Parliament to be more assertive in ensuring that the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement are met.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, the EU’s general budget reflects the serious tendencies of economies marked by current financial prospects. There will be EUR 120 billion in payment appropriations, accounting for 0.96% of the Member States’ total GNI. All this is quite modest, and a far cry from the actual needs of the political project announced by the European decision-makers in the Council, in the Commission and also here in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have often cited the causes of this in the House: national egoisms rocking the common boat, excessive caution by the Commission when implementing our budgetary guidelines, or the EU’s general inability to come up with innovative, realistic projects. This year, once again, led by our excellent rapporteurs – including Mr Virrankoski – we had to find solutions to develop policies that we feel are essential and new pilot projects that our fellow citizens expect. This year, once again, we have witnessed the slender financial framework for the EU’s international action, which does not make it any easier for us when taking up our commitments concerning Palestine and Kosovo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This year, however, one project managed to overcome such rigidness: Galileo. I would especially like to thank Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Mr Romero, Chairman Böge and Mr Virrankoski, and all the members of the Committee on Budgets, both Members and administrators, whose firm conviction and negotiating strategy were rewarded by a financing agreement with the Council. I feel like saying: ‘Luckily the Commission and Parliament were there’, but I cannot neglect the role played by the Portuguese Presidency and Mr Santos, who got things moving with his know-how and his ability to listen. We should remember that after the negotiations it is Europe as a whole that has secured the financing of Galileo entirely through Community funds. With the European Technology Institute, the package totals EUR 2.7 billion, without jeopardising any EU policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This example of a joint political demand is a rare item in the EP’s budgetary history. The Socialists interpret this as a sign of hope not only for the autonomy of the EU’s satellite navigation as of 2013, but also as an indication of Parliament’s ability to make use of its powers and fulfil its responsibilities in the preparation of the EU’s budgetary future.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I would also like to highlight the excellent negotiation result that we can celebrate in connection with the adoption of the 2008 budget on Thursday. I congratulate my colleague Mr Virrankoski as rapporteur on the Commission’s budget. He has succeeded in doing what many had thought impossible, namely to strike a compromise involving the revision of the multi-annual budget framework and the financial perspective, without us having to involve the Heads of State or Government or have a large-scale negotiation drama in late December.</p>
      <p sl="da">The results of the negotiations that we have before us provide the billions necessary for financing the Galileo satellite navigation system without us having to reduce funding for other essential programmes. It is available agricultural money, it is money from the flexibility instrument, and it is money that would not otherwise have been used that will now be spent to ensure that the EU can go ahead with the important investment in Galileo. It will place basic infrastructure and important skills at the EU’s full disposal. Extra money has also been found for Palestine and Kosovo through use of the flexibility instrument.</p>
      <p sl="da">Overall, we have arrived at a historically good solution here. We need a more flexible EU budget, where each year we can secure funding for essential needs. This does not necessarily mean a more expensive budget, but a more rigid implementation of the rules and a focus on relevant problems. Many people have contributed to the excellent solution. Mrs Grybauskaitė has guided us both prudently and with authority. Parliament has stood united and ensured that there was support for the wishes of the Commission. I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Böge, for his strong and capable leadership, and also the coordinators of the other groups for their excellent cooperation. Thanks are also due to Mr Itälä for his sound efforts and to the Portuguese Presidency for the work done towards achieving an excellent result. This has been a victory both for the EU and for common sense.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are today discussing the draft 2008 European Union budget for the last time. It appears to correspond to our expectations, though the most heated debate has centred on its size, as is usually the case. Nonetheless, we have to operate within the agreed framework and adjust individual positions to it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We endeavoured to take account of all the amendments, but sometimes this proved impossible, as they were mutually exclusive. I am especially pleased that discharging Europe's responsibilities as a global partner we tried to increase resources for action of this nature as much as possible. On the basis of today's address by Mr Salih Mahmoud Osman, the Sakharov Prize laureate, the world is most certainly counting on the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this connection I should like to say that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on whose behalf I am speaking, will vote in favour of the draft budget tabled. I should like to thank all colleagues very much for our achievement. Everyone has commended it. Thank you again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the Verts/ALE Group too, the crucial question is whether the European budget is truly geared to future needs and responds to the formidable challenges of the coming years, particularly as regards our responsibility in the field of foreign policy but also in relation to research and development, education and, of course, the struggle against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do not believe that the budget as a whole is good enough yet to rise to these major challenges. Nevertheless, we find it gratifying that the decision in favour of Galileo has now been taken. That represents something like a bridgehead from which we can go on to change the budget and fit it more adequately for the future, and it is also a historic step for the European Union to put on track such an ambitious project in the realm of industrial policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe it is very important, particularly in the light of the Lisbon agenda, that Europe should not leave these new technological developments, this navigation system, to the United States or China but that our aim should be to play our own self-assured role in the world and in the global marketplace.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, I believe we must do even more in the coming years to engineer these changes and to find appropriate answers to global issues. I am also delighted that we have managed to reallocate resources from the Euratom programme to fund Galileo. In my opinion, spending existing money on better and less environmentally harmful technology is another step forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to add my thanks to my fellow committee members, to Mr Böge and to the two rapporteurs for their hard work on this budget. I certainly believe it is a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, tomorrow we shall adopt the EU’s budget for next year, one in which payments clearly fall below the 1% ceiling, to say nothing of the fact that it will be 1.24% of GNI. In that respect the outcome is satisfactory to those in our group who want to save their own countries’ taxpayers’ money. On the other hand, there are many in our group who would have liked the Commission’s budget to follow the policy that Parliament adopts in the way it uses its resources, which smacks of poorer budgetary discipline. It is always trying to find new areas for expenditure, although there may be no good use for the money.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In our group there are also two attitudes to the Galileo project. Some want to see it financed out of the EU’s budget; others entirely reject Galileo on account of its huge cost. It is feared that it will be poor value for what is public money. As the private companies have pulled out, Galileo’s future now depends on financing by the EU. Our group takes a dim view of the militarisation of the Galileo project, which was originally meant exclusively for civil use.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We also take a dim view of the additional financing out of the EU’s budget for the Union’s foreign, security and defence policy. We adhere to the notion that the EU is a peace organisation and that it should not be militarised and become a superpower’s agent. For that is what it will be if the Council wants to put more money into financing the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We do not want to be involved in the use of EU budget funds to prop up the political heritage of old transitional states in Africa or the illegal actions of the United States of America, which has acted as a torturer in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In view of all this, our group will vote, in a spirit of amicability, against Mr Virrankoski’s budget report.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank and pay tribute to the rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä. They have done a very competent and responsible job and, in so doing, have also been able to keep the budget down at a lower level than I had thought possible at the outset. But they were, of course, obliged to work within the limits imposed on them and I would point out that these limits are unreasonable.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, the revenue side is essentially a predetermined amount. About 1% of gross national income goes to the EU. But that is not how it should happen in a rational system. The right approach is first to decide what the EU has to do, then see how much it will cost, and finally collect the money for it. What should not be done is first to collect money and then wonder what it can be spent on. That is quite the wrong way to proceed, and everyone knows it. So let us change it!</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, we know that at least 75% of the money spent by the EU is devoted to completely useless and harmful causes. Hence we have a huge amount of money to spend on useful projects. Roughly half is still spent in practice on the agricultural policy and a further quarter to a third on something called ‘the structural funds on the structural side’. In fact the EU should not be doing any of this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What the EU should be doing is to develop and monitor regulatory systems for the internal market and for environmental cooperation. This costs amazingly little. If we switch to this for the future, we shall be able to reduce the EU contribution and still have money left for other things that the EU should be doing. In my opinion, these include Galileo, which is now to be financed. That is a success. We should invest heavily in basic research, since that would enable us to develop fusion energy. This is the proper task of the EU. Not agents to combat forest fires, structural adjustment to globalisation and other schemes which are pure propaganda spending.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, many of the common policies which receive financial support from the EU budget are not good. They neither foster the effective development of the European Union’s production structures nor do they increase their competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The agriculture sector, which receives almost 40% of the EU budget, is typical in this regard. In the context of the overall developments, the EU’s common agricultural policy appears very inflexible and rigid. It has been deformed in the course of its history by various compromises based on gradual concessions, predominantly to large Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Up to now, with all the reforms we have more or less preserved the inefficient redistribution of resources. We still have a situation whereby 80% of European resources are being used by 20% of companies, concentrated in the old Member States. This creates unequal conditions for the new Member States and discriminates against them.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It clearly runs contrary to the basic rules of the market to create the national envelopes on the basis of the so-called historic principle, as is being considered in connection with the wine sector reform. The EU common agricultural policy must guarantee that its tools have equivalent effect and that there is equal access to the EU budget as well as the national budgets of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">They say that budgets reflect or mirror the intended economic policies. I am afraid that through no fault of its own, the part of the European budget dealing with agriculture unfortunately offers a distorting mirror.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, this is a fine draft budget, and we all ought to congratulate ourselves on it. Enough, however, has been said as to the content of the draft document.</p>
      <p sl="es">I wish to state how pleased I am with two aspects: implementation of the budget and the successful conciliation procedure.</p>
      <p sl="es">To start with implementation of the budget, I think this year we have managed to add value to the money spent from the budget, we have fulfilled our commitments more successfully and we have had good cooperation and sound exchanges of information with the European Commission. I think we can safely say for most areas of the budget that implementation has been satisfactory in 2007, and among other things this means that we can have lower reserves vis-à-vis the Commission than in previous years. This in turn entails a much smoother procedure, even in the knowledge that we are in one of the initial years of financial programming, of the new financial perspective period: this means that that implementation of the Structural Funds will be a little low, but I feel sure that it will pick up pace.</p>
      <p sl="es">With respect to conciliation, the basis of this fine agreement, I wish once more to congratulate the European Commission on all the assistance from the Commissioner, the EP delegation and of course the Portuguese Presidency, which operated in such cohesive fashion. They have operated as a genuine team and its members even come here wearing the same ties, meaning they really do operate as a team: it is certainly thanks to them that we have been able to finance technological development and protect taxpayers through non-excessive use of payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should not change this formula in the years to come, and for future budgetary conciliations we must always bear in mind that this House represents citizens and that their will is expressed through the political groups. Nor should we forget that the budget is a political act in itself.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the budgetary procedure for 2008 has shown how far the European Parliament can progress in negotiations with the Council if we are determined to implement our ideas for a European policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">From the outset we have said that, following the demise of the public-private partnership idea, Galileo would have to be financed with European funds on the basis of the Community method. Anything else would have been unacceptable to Parliament. Parliament stood its ground on that point and then pressurised the Council – or, let us be honest, forced the Council – to break new ground in voting by a majority – not unanimously, mind you – to approve the compromise with us, which includes what is termed a small revision. I say that here as a German who is grateful to the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a result, we shall be able to fund Galileo and the European Institute of Technology properly until 2013. While this makes me proud of our Parliament, I am not forgetting, of course, the extremely helpful role that the Commission has played in this budgetary process. My sincere thanks go to you, Commissioner, and to all the staff of your departments. You unquestionably helped to ensure that the Council was put on the right path, not only in relation to our competition and innovation policies but also with regard to the arrangements on foreign policies. Our compromise will also provide us with enough funds for the time being to honour our European commitments in Kosovo and Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="de">It goes without saying that Parliament has had to pay a price for this progress. In 2008 an appropriation of EUR 285 million will be made to the common foreign and security policy. While this is EUR 125 million more than the 2007 allocation, we are all well aware that heading 4 will remain chronically underfunded until the end of the period covered by the financial perspective. However delighted we in Parliament might initially be at this shift in the Council’s position, we must also strongly emphasise that the Council has not only remained focused on its main aim of paying out as little as possible but has actually achieved that aim. Total planned expenditure amounts to EUR 120.3 billion, which represents only 0.96% of the combined gross national income of the Member States, whereas the financial perspective provides for 1.04%.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2008, then, we shall have a tight-fitting budget, although we should have preferred something more comfortable. All the more reason for a concerted effort on our part to ensure that the Commission implements the multiannual programmes swiftly and correctly, that it acts on our comments on specific budget lines in ways that match our intentions, that its initial response to our proposals for pilot projects and preparatory measures is to seek ways of implementing them, not to describe all the obstacles to their realisation. I call on all Members, including those who serve on specialised committees, to monitor the implementation of the 2008 budget systematically and critically.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me conclude by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, all my fellow Members and the secretariat for their wholehearted constructive cooperation in 2007. I hope for the same parliamentary solidarity in 2008 whenever I have the task of drafting a report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I would like to compliment and congratulate our rapporteurs and the general rapporteur, our friend Kyösti Virrankoski, and the entire EP delegation, expertly led by Mr Böge. I also congratulate the Commission and, more unusually, the Council Presidency, which dared to take up its responsibilities. Minister, if there were a European légion d’honneur , I feel you would richly deserve it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main concern I and many of my colleagues had in relation to the 2008 budget was ensuring full Community financing for the launch of the Galileo project, and consequently the European Technology Institute, without jeopardising the funding for programmes aimed at implementing the Lisbon Strategy. The result has been achieved: this is good news for Europe as a whole, and also good news we can explain easily and simply to our fellow citizens, who understand its scope.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If I can put on my LIBE Chairman’s cap for a moment, I wish to express my satisfaction that the Commission on Budgets supported the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs concerning the elimination of the reserves in connection with SIS II and Frontex. These are two essential instruments for the surveillance of the EU’s external borders, and we must increase their operational capability. On the other hand, I request that we leave in reserve all appropriations relating to the European Return Fund until Parliament and the Council have adopted the proposal for a directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is hard to be optimistic regarding the 2008 budget, because it is the lowest for many years in relation to the gross national income of the Member States, in terms of both commitment appropriations and payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to remind the House that in the financial perspective 2007-2013 the ceiling for commitment appropriations for 2008 was set at 1.08% of gross national income. It was set at 1.06% of gross national income for payment appropriations. There is therefore a significant difference between what the European Union was prepared to finance only two years ago, and what it is now prepared to finance. We cannot have more Europe for such limited funding in any of the areas to which the European Union allocates financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I welcome the fact that the conciliation procedure resulted in an agreement on financing the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology. I hope, too, that the European Parliament will agree that budgetary reserves may be drawn on to finance the Frontex Agency. This is particularly significant for countries such as Poland. As early as December the borders of these countries will become the external borders of the European Union in the full sense of the term.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, at the heart of a policy without any ‘-isms’ is credibility. Credibility has a great deal to do with the purposes to which available tax revenue is put, and people can see this most clearly in the amounts spent on administrative bodies. Regrettably, this budget once again fails to indicate precisely how much is actually to be spent on administration. We have an item with EUR 6.6 billion there, but administrative expenditure is also hidden away inside many other appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Besides, whether the lifestyle of the political classes bears any relation to the living conditions of the vast majority of the population or not says something fundamental about the democratic nature of a society. We have a glaring example of a gulf between the two inside the European Union in the form of the pension scheme for officials as well as for those in this House who are in the luxury-class supplementary pension scheme. In the case of officials, the total volume of annual payments now stands at EUR 963 million, to which these officials themselves contribute no more than a third. The bill, moreover, just keeps rising. The number of pension recipients alone is set to increase by 5.5%. The inflation rate is automatically factored in. In this way Brussels is becoming increasingly remote from those it claims to represent, and that is bad for democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">This would be a starting point for rational budgetary reform, and it is also a call to action for you, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me begin with my warmest thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Itälä and Mr Virrankoski, who have done a very good job over the past few months and have produced extremely sound reports. I extend these thanks to the coordinators and staff of the political groups and also wish to express my sincere gratitude to the committee secretariat. Let me pick out the names of Anne Vitrey, Ian Vollbracht and Marie-Cécile Bernard as a way of thanking the entire team, who have worked extremely hard for all of us. I must also say that we could not have arrived at this final cumulative outcome on which we shall be voting on Thursday without the great solidarity shown by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, with your knack of seizing the right moment, as you did once again at these negotiations, you made an absolutely vital contribution to their successful outcome, for which I warmly thank you. As someone who has experienced a good few budgetary coordination processes, I wish to pay glowing tribute to the Portuguese Presidency for the way it conducted the Council’s negotiations in this difficult situation. It wrote a new chapter in the history of the EU institutions in securing the final vote and consent of the Council, an achievement which we deeply and keenly appreciate.</p>
      <p sl="de">All in all, then, we have a budget for year two of the financial perspective period with a volume of EUR 120.3 billion, corresponding to 0.96% of the Member States’ aggregate gross national income, a budget that is very heavily geared to fiscal discipline.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a budget that safeguards the programmes which create added European value, such as the ones we have just adopted here. We have a budget that safeguards the foundations of the strategic Galileo project until 2013 in the first instance, and the secret lay in a mix of revision, flexibility and reallocation. We have a budget that provides extra resources for Frontex, thereby permitting essential responses to pressing challenges, and we have a budget that funds the common foreign and security policy, albeit only for 2008, and makes it possible to draw on the flexibility instrument for CFSP purposes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say here that we should have preferred a long-term, multiannual approach that would have shored up the chronically underfunded heading 4, ‘the EU as a global partner’. That, however, is a subject to which the CFSP, Palestine and Kosovo will surely compel us to return in connection with Mrs Haug’s forthcoming report on the priorities for the following budget. I commend to the House the present budget in its agreed form.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me a brief summary in the area of ‘other sections’.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Parliament’s work on the budget has resulted in major achievements and I will mention just a few. Firstly, we reached a compromise on the overall size of the budget.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Secondly, as regards providing EU citizens with information about the work of the European Parliament and its results, we now have the tools for better cooperation and communication with citizens. It must be stressed, however, that making progress in improving Parliament’s information and communication strategy, would not in itself be sufficient. If it is to be effective, the strategy requires the involvement of the Commission and of the European offices in the individual countries. It must be coordinated and its results evaluated on a regular basis. In that way we can achieve not only better access to information but also more transparency and a better use of resources.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for supporting our efforts in building our knowledge management system. It will help you in your future legislative work.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Fourthly, we have achieved more flexibility for groups of visitors.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Fifthly, I believe that the measures taken to support language services will result both in higher quality services and a better use of resources.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Finally, we reached agreement on several points concerning the environment and access to employment for the disabled.</p>
      <p sl="sk">What is important for the budget for ‘other sections’ is to assess each institution individually. I would like to mention the Court of Auditors as an example of good practice in terms of drawing up a budget. Savings were made in some budget lines by working out the budget on the basis of real expenditure rather than index-linked calculations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank our rapporteurs as well as all the teams from the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. Our meetings, debates and conciliation procedures have all left me feeling very satisfied. When you feel that all those involved want to reach an agreement, it makes for a positive environment, which can only lead to good results.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know in 2006 many of us voted for the multiannual budget for the financial perspective with a heavy heart . We were in fact fully aware that the contributions by the Member States would not be enough to take up the major challenges facing an EU comprising 27 nations and, notably, half a billion citizens. This inadequate budget, aggravated by the withdrawal of the private partners who had hitherto been stakeholders in the Galileo project, made us vulnerable to serious problems and was the source of much concern.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore glad that Parliament has been heard this time after a very long battle with the Member States in the Council. This 2008 budget is in fact a victory for Europeans and for the House, and I also wish to express my most sincere thanks to our general rapporteur and his entire team for their difficult negotiations, and also of course to Chairman Böge and the COBU Members and administrative staff.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased that after hours of intense negotiations we have secured total credits of almost EUR 120 billion, representing 0.96% of the EU's GNP. This is due in particular to use of the flexibility instrument, which will allow us to considerably increase CFSP appropriations (heading 4), with particular emphasis on Kosovo and Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, like my colleagues I welcome the payments secured for Galileo, which is a major crucial project that will enable Europe to retain and even improve its ranking as a space power and guarantee us independence from other countries. This is a great success, not only politically but also in terms of employment, attractiveness and, notably, visibility of European integration for our fellow citizens: quite simply it is a great success for our future.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ‘And yet it moves!’ Galileo Galilei allegedly said. Now, after many years of fault-finding, the Galileo programme moves yet. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission, the Commissioner and Parliament on forcing an agreement. But why is force needed? Why did the Council not act sooner? Why is it shocked and horrified that the Union has to pay again? Why are we not glad that the Union is willing and able to implement important programmes like Galileo? Why did we need to scrape together the necessary amount from left-over money instead of everyone bearing the costs of investment as well as the profit? Why does the Council try to reduce resources for cohesion policy from one year to the next – by more than EUR 100 million this year? Why was it necessary to withhold agricultural aid for the new Member States for ten years, and to make European citizens who are aided in different ways compete with each other in the common market?</p>
      <p sl="hu">When the Austrian emperor and king of Hungary asked for help with the wars of Maria Theresa, the Hungarian nobles gave the spirited response, ‘Our life and our blood!’ But they added ‘No oats,’ in other words, we will not bear the costs. It is difficult to be successful with such behaviour. We should not regard the Union’s budget as wasted money. It is an instrument through which European citizens get value for their money. Parliament, the Commission and finally the Council have worked on this. If only the thoughts and intentions had clicked sooner. Thank you for your kind attention.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, once again we can congratulate ourselves that an agreement has been reached after so many attempts. It was a long and painful process and everyone who played a part can now look back on it with a clear conscience. The big question is whether this is the best procedure for adopting the budget. I think that it would be a good idea, once the new Treaty has been ratified, for us to look again at whether we cannot find a quicker and more effective way to do this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We could also, for example, consider the question of whether deciding on pilot schemes and preparatory actions at this late stage is the best method or whether we should do that at an earlier stage. I think the latter. If we look at the negotiations, the major successes of this budget are the Galileo project and the European Institute for Technology.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When I read the press reports about all the negotiations, it always seems as if there is only one institution that matters and that is the Council of Ministers. Once the agreement was concluded and you read the press reports, it was always ‘agreement has been reached in the Council of Ministers’. Is it not possible to get the message through to the public for once that it was not exactly like that? It was difficult to persuade the Council to adjust the multiannual budget.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In itself that is commendable: the Treaty is still new, but there was a pressing need for it. I think that we should adhere to the Treaty and to the multiannual budget, but that also applies to the Council, especially as regards the point in Article 44 on the presentation of country statements concerning sound financial management. Perhaps the Council could also give that some attention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in terms of both structure and size, the 2008 budget indicates that we are still at the early stages of introduction of new generation multiannual programmes linked to the financial perspective 2007-2013. One relevant example is the record low level of payments in relation to gross national income.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am cautiously optimistic that in 2008 the beneficiaries of this budget will give the European Parliament a pleasant surprise, and simultaneously give an unpleasant one to the Finance Ministers by calling for a so-called amending budget as a result of higher implementation than currently estimated, notably concerning the Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Conciliation was extremely successful, and was indeed a joint success for the three participating institutions. I congratulate Mr Böge on his role as the head of Parliament's delegation. Congratulations are also due to the rapporteurs, the secretariat and others involved. As has already been mentioned in today's debate, however, the conciliation procedure generated an unpleasant impression. It felt as if rather than being actively involved in reaching the agreement and party to it, the role of Parliament's delegation was that of some kind of observer in a deal-making arrangement between certain national delegations. The latter were particularly interested in the method of financing and even more so in the public procurement contracts related to the Galileo programme.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This unpleasant impression was subsequently reflected in media comments on the event. It should be remembered that the main purpose of the latter was budget conciliation. It was more than simply a meeting between the Finance Ministers of interested countries. On behalf of the European Parliament, I hereby undertake that we will draw conclusions from this experience for future meetings of this nature in 2008.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, allow me to begin by paying a compliment to the President of the Council. I believe you have greatly adorned this Chamber with your Portuguese Presidency ties, and you have generated an esprit de corps in the Council that we should never have thought possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">From the perspective of budgetary control, there are two points on which we wish to lay particular emphasis for this coming financial year. The first point, to which the Commissioner has already referred, is the continuation of the screening exercise focusing on the staff establishment in the realms of coordination and administrative support. We know that the Commission itself has doubts as to whether it actually needs to have 1 700 employees assigned to communication or 3 500 to document management or 1 700 in the personnel directorate. All of these together amount to almost a third of the staff in the support and coordination services. We seek to ensure that the administration is not concerned with itself but that its workforce contains employees who can implement the political priorities of the Commission as well as those of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason we continue to call on the Commission to shed further light on these areas of activity in an action plan. This issue must remain on the agenda, and it will remain on the agenda, with or without the reserve, with or without paragraph 11 of our resolution and even with or without the fulfilment of prior conditions. I urge you very strongly to continue to pursue this matter. You have commented on it; I have heard those comments, and I shall judge you by them. I believe that this Commission certainly can draw up an action plan, for this particular Commission is in a position to do so. Its successors, however, will not be. This is why I believe it is important for you to fulfil this prior condition, to carry out the appropriate preliminary work. I myself am very interested in this matter and am always willing to discuss it with you.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point to which we attach importance concerns national management declarations for funds that are subject to shared management. Mr President-in-Office, during our conciliation procedure you made certain statements in which you indicated to us that you would deal with this matter. So far you have not said precisely how you intend to set about this task. Our call for action on this issue also extends to the Slovenian Presidency. We strongly urge the Commission to use the relevant guidelines to establish the conditions in which we can initiate talks with the Member States in the first place. Without recourse to these guidelines and without corresponding activities on the part of the Member States, it will be difficult to take any action.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr. President, the European Union budget for the year 2008 is a pragmatic one, of results, guided by the current development priorities of the European Union. All through the budgetary procedure, the European Parliament used its prerogative of control over the other institutions for promoting the main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, economic competitiveness and employment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Parliament transferred funds designated to the Commission to reserve, due to deficiencies in the approval system for operational programmes, because exceeding of deadlines means money lost by the European citizen. The same thing happens in the case of delays in recruiting personnel from the new Member States, which has generated important costs and affected the activity of the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thus, I consider it is very important that, after the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, the competence of the Parliament will significantly increase, co-decision will become a general rule and the veto of the Parliament in adopting the budget will be extended to agriculture as well.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The solutions found for financing the great technological projects of the European Union, namely Galileo and the European Institute of Technology, result in significant assistance for research and development. Nevertheless, we have to make sure that the European assistance will be distributed uniformly and will not deepen the already existing technological and informational development gaps between the Member States. Although it is a technical solution for financing these programmes, the use of the agriculture margin should not become a rule. Agriculture should not be a field whose fate is decided beforehand and whose funds are systematically deviated. I am very glad about the support you provided for increasing the amounts designated for the European programme for financing the school milk scheme and expanding it to other products as well.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I consider the increasing involvement of the European Union in the educational field, in general, and the expansion of scholarship and continuous training programmes, in particular, to be very important. For this reason, I thank you for supporting the amendment regarding the significant increase of the budget in this field for the next year.</p>

Simply put, the European Union shows that it can provide Community solutions to large-scale, complex problems where others have failed.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is the first positive message. However, there is another, negative message connected with the broader trend of the budget figures: the fact that this year we are spending, for next year, 0.95% of the Community GDP does not strike me as good news. I have heard that some fellow Members regard it as a success. For me it is not. It proves that we are spending as much now, with 27 Member States, as we were when there were 15. Budgets at this level do not represent the scale of ambition of the European enterprise. Building on this year’s success, we should start preparing the future allocations in good time, and I am glad that discussion of this has already begun.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me end on a personal note: on Thursday when we vote on the budget, it will be a year since Loyola de Palacio – the architect of this great European project – passed away. A great European, a great woman, a woman who initiated this process, the successful conclusion of which we shall be voting through on Thursday. I believe that for a politician who speaks through her work, there can be no better memorial.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Thank you, Mr President. One of the points on which Parliament and the Council are agreed is to substantially increase the Frontex agency’s budget – in fact this has been doubled. I would like to state that between this budget’s first reading and its second reading, at which it will be approved this week, Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs had an intensive session with the Head of the Frontex agency, in which we spoke and were given a detailed presentation about the agency’s work programme for the coming year. This presentation, Mr President, convinced us that we are doing the right thing in increasing this agency’s budget and that with more means at its disposal throughout the coming year, the agency will be more effective than it has been so far. The Head of the agency also supplied us with the details of several new missions to be carried out in the course of next year on the external borders of the Union – land-, air- as well as sea-based missions. As regards sea-based missions, it gives us great satisfaction to see that Frontex’s activity will increase substantially on maritime borders, especially in the centre of the Mediterranean, but also in the Eastern Mediterranean, where we have recently seen problems increase substantially. Meanwhile, missions will also continue near the Canary Islands. Mr President, I am in no doubt that the citizens of the countries affected will welcome Frontex’s more effective presence to help them meet the influx of migrants, which, as we all know, is a main preoccupation for citizens of these countries. They will therefore appreciate the decisions we have taken as regards budget. Moreover, I have no doubt that with this budget we are going to send a clear message to the organised crime network that is benefiting from the trafficking of migrants, a message that their activity will not be tolerated. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the Members’ speeches and I must say to you that, while I indicated at the beginning my delight at the success achieved, I now have all the more reason to feel extremely satisfied, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Council, at the results that we have all managed to achieve together.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Please allow me to add that not only do these results allow us to feel satisfied, but they also give prestige to our institutions: Parliament, the Council and the European Commission. In the eyes of European citizens, we have demonstrated a common will and a common ambition to continue building the European Union, now with 27 Member States, as an area of peace, democracy, freedom, justice and also prosperity. I must take advantage of this occasion to express my great hopes, not only for the correct implementation of the budget to be adopted, but also for the correct implementation of the projects which were covered by these negotiations. Many thanks to everyone for their generous words addressed to the Council. Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

This reflects the changes in the Commission’s priorities. The size of the budget has long been known: just under 1% of GNI, which means around EUR 120.3 billion for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The budget also looks to the future, with the result that EUR 3.4 billion will go on the Galileo satellite radio navigation system, and EUR 309 million on the European Institute of Technology (EIT). There was also further investment in the Common Foreign and Security Policy. This is immensely important for strengthening our credible international role.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As regards Parliament, Mr Itälä has highlighted the importance of budgetary discipline and that of the responsible use of public funds.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be here today to witness this debate on the ninth EU Annual Report on Human Rights. This report covers the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007 and was formally presented to the European Parliament on 26 November in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As in previous years, the ninth EU Annual Report on Human Rights 2007 is a genuinely joint report prepared by the Presidency, the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the human rights-related work of the European Union during the Finnish and German Presidencies. The report aims to illustrate how the common values on which the EU is based translate into concrete human rights-related activities in its bilateral relations with third countries, in multilateral fora and in relation to a number of thematic issues. A second objective of this report is to ensure transparency in the EU’s human rights-related activities and also to ensure the visibility of these multiple and extremely important activities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should now like to highlight the most striking general aspects of the EU’s policy on human rights during the period in question. These were as follows: implementation of the EU guidelines on human rights – as you know, we already have guidelines on torture, the death penalty, human rights defenders and children in armed conflict; the development of new more comprehensive EU guidelines on the rights of the child, initially focused on the issue of violence against children; the first year of functioning of the UN Human Rights Council; the conclusion of the institution building process of this new body and, finally, the mainstreaming of human rights into all aspects of EU policies, including crisis management in operations and missions of the European Security and Defence Policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although the structure of this report largely follows the same format as last year, this year’s edition strives to provide additional focus on analysis in order to offer a more comprehensive and in-depth overview of the impact and effectiveness of EU action in the fields of human rights and democratisation. This focus on analysis stems from the suggestions made by the European Parliament contained in the Coveney report from April.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report therefore presents the EU’s human rights-related activities from both thematic and country perspectives. This year two new sections have been added: one on the neighbourhood policy and the other on freedom of religion and belief. We wanted, in this way, to underline the importance we place on the fight against intolerance based on belief or religion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The annual report includes comments on the resolution sponsored by the European Union on this subject during the 2006 session of the United Nations General Assembly. I have pleasure in informing you that this year we again sponsored a resolution on intolerance based on religion or belief which was adopted by consensus in the UN Third Committee.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the Human Rights Council session which began yesterday, 10 December, in Geneva, another EU resolution on religious intolerance will be presented. This particularly aims to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. We hope that this resolution will also be adopted by consensus. The report also includes a more comprehensive section on the European Parliament’s activities to promote and protect human rights and democracy, particularly through resolutions, but also through hearings and debates organised in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development and with representatives of third countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Parliament’s vital contribution to our joint efforts to promote and protect human rights is undeniable. The report also mentions the mechanisms developed within the EU to guarantee respect for and protection of human rights. Mention should be made in this respect of the establishment of the Agency for Fundamental Rights on 1 March of this year, replacing the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. The report highlights, among other activities, the steps taken to implement the EU guidelines on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to start by mentioning the steps taken throughout this year to implement the guidelines on the death penalty. By cooperating with countries in all regions, the EU has given great impetus to its campaign against the death penalty. Throughout the reporting period, the EU took numerous steps on the death penalty, trying to convince countries to change their positions on this issue and also trying to save human lives. It was also in the context of these guidelines that we presented a declaration on the death penalty in 2006 to the United Nations General Assembly which led this year to the adoption of the resolution against the death penalty on 15 November.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have also reinforced our position against torture within the context of the guidelines and continued to improve the implementation of the guidelines on children in armed conflicts and also on human rights defenders. This year, the EU has also taken a new initiative and developed a set of guidelines on the rights of the child which will in all likelihood be adopted by the Council at the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The core of the report continues to be the EU’s activities in the area of the common foreign and security policy, dialogues on human rights with various countries and troika consultations. Information is given on the development of policies and actions in relation to 20 different thematic issues, including not only those areas in which the EU has adopted human rights guidelines, but also other thematic issues, such as women’s rights, children’s rights, the fight against racism and the trafficking of human beings.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report includes an analysis of the EU’s activities in neighbouring countries and provides an overview of the EU’s activities in international organisations. I would remind you in this respect that the period analysed in this report coincides with the first year of activities of the Human Rights Council, with the European Union having actively contributed to the latter’s work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another priority for the EU in relation to human rights has, as in previous years, been the streamlining of human rights into all aspects of EU policies. I am thinking of the planning and execution of crisis management operations and missions under the European Security and Defence Policy and the assignment of dedicated human rights and gender advisers to missions. The mandates of the special representatives of the European Union have also now become concrete instructions in this area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I also welcome this EU report, which is a joint report by the Council and the European Commission. Those of you who were present the first time I spoke here as a Commissioner will know that it has always been my wish for us to address this issue together. I would also like to thank those in Parliament who have contributed to our report. At the end of the day, this is a very good document which expresses what we have to say, and shows what we have been doing, in the field of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday the world celebrated International Human Rights Day, which is particularly significant this year as it marks the start of the celebrations to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That was the first step in establishing a comprehensive international framework for the protection of human rights, which has now been followed by an impressive codification of international human rights law over the past decades.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, the challenge is to turn implementation into reality, worldwide. For instance, the deplorable human rights situations in Burma/Myanmar, in Sudan/Darfur, Iran and Zimbabwe are a stark reminder of the challenge we face, and one brought home to us today by the winner of the Sakharov Prize, Mr Osman. He has clearly shown us the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to draw your attention to four key developments which have particularly marked the European Union’s activities over the past year. First, we have seen important changes within the United Nations human rights system. The institution-building phase of the Human Rights Council has been more or less successfully completed, and there is ground for cautious optimism, provided the Council addresses human rights violations in a timely manner whenever and wherever they occur.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that light, we were pleased to see that, further to the EU’s initiative, the Human Rights Council has taken steps to address the grave violation of human rights in Burma/Myanmar, and also in Sudan/Darfur. Moreover, we also welcome the creation of the system of the Universal Periodic Review which, as of next year, will also allow for a regular thorough examination of the human rights records of every UN member state.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the creation of the Human Rights Council, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly remains, of course, an equally important forum for human rights issues. The European Union will continue to make full use of that Committee to propose both thematic and country resolutions. At this year’s session there was a particular success – namely the adoption for the first time of a resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Thanks to the EU’s initiative and the building of a cross-regional coalition, the historic condemnation of the death penalty marks a crucial step in building an international consensus towards its eventual eradication.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, one of the most important tools at our disposal for raising human rights issues with third countries is the human rights dialogues. They also enable us to raise particular human rights concerns with a partner country, make recommendations for improvement and also discuss possible ways to promote reform through training projects or cooperation. The last year has seen a considerable increase in the number of human rights dialogues.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now conduct dialogues with around 25 partner countries. For example, we have established human rights dialogues with most of the European neighbourhood countries, and initial meetings have generally been quite – and sometimes highly – constructive.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first round of the human rights experts’ dialogues, including with the African Union, has opened up new possibilities for engaging with the African continent on human rights. In May 2007, the European Union held the first human rights dialogue with Uzbekistan, and the EU strategy for Central Asia foresees the establishment of such dialogues with all Central Asian countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as the number of dialogues increases, we must be vigilant to ensure consistency and effectiveness – a point that the European Parliament rightly underlined in its resolution of 6 September 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, let me turn to the EU human rights guidelines. I am pleased – and the Council Presidency has already noted this – that 2007 has seen the adoption of the new guidelines on the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, jointly with an implementation strategy. As a first priority, we shall address under those guidelines the crucial issue of violence against children.</p>
      <p sl="en">As in the case of all EU guidelines it is, of course, implementation that counts. The European Union has, in particular, been active under the guidelines on the death penalty, torture and ill-treatment, with numerous general démarches, but also with many specific representations on individual death-penalty or torture cases in a range of third countries. We will consistently raise these matters in political dialogue meetings with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I must mention the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which has been in place since January 2007. The EIDHR enables us to provide funding directly to civil society organisations worldwide, without the intervention of governments. This has become a vital instrument for strengthening grass-roots organisations throughout the world, without which human rights and democracy could not flourish. The EIDHR puts a new emphasis on the promotion of democracy and also allows us to provide support for actions in support of the EU human rights guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="en">A further innovation is that funds can now be mobilised to assist human rights defenders who are in danger as a result of their activities. In total, some EUR 140 million will be available each year under this instrument, and the first calls for project proposals are now open.</p>
      <p sl="en">Time allows me only to touch on those few points today. However, I think any reader of this good and interesting annual report cannot fail to be struck both by the sheer geographic scope of our activities on human rights and by the range of thematic issues covered.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to the topics I have already mentioned, I would like to say that the European Union has been active on issues as diverse as promoting membership of the International Criminal Court (ICC), women’s rights and the rights of persons with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The year 2007 has been a year of achievements. Nevertheless, we are also aware that human rights violations remain, unfortunately, endemic throughout the globe. In this 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we will, of course, continue our efforts to ensure that the rights contained in that Declaration eventually become a tangible reality for all of us.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First of all, I would like to thank all those who have prepared the annual report. Not only the European Parliament, but also such institutions as The United Nations Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and NGOs that continue to work in the sphere of protection of the human rights, a dialogue that cannot be overestimated, have been looking forward to this document. I am talking about the dialogue between the European Parliament, its Subcommittee on Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council, society and the groups within them.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I agree with the ideas expressed by the country holding the EU Council Presidency and by the Commissioner. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight several points.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The annual report is a detailed survey of the actions taken by the EU globally in the sphere of human rights. It covers the activity of the EU Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament. The report gives an account of situations in certain regions of the world, but I feel there are several issues missing that would have made the report even more valuable.</p>
      <p sl="lt">First of all, the report is lacking in the evaluation of the EU human rights policy. At the end of the year it would be good to learn the opinion of the Council and the Commission of the results and the effect of the actions mentioned. Such an account would be of much greater value than one that simply provides a list of actions taken, no matter how long that list might be. A result-oriented outlook would highlight all the actions taken by the EU in the area of protection of human rights and would underline the insignificance. This also applies to the individual cases mentioned in the report: what results has the European Union actually achieved? Could it be that our tactics and activities have yielded no results at all or have even had negative consequences?</p>
      <p sl="lt">On the other hand, I am missing a clearer explanation of the European Parliament’s work and the recommendations for resolutions that we have adopted. The European Parliament would benefit from having information on which of its recommendations have been taken into consideration by the Commission and the Council, which of them have been implemented and what the results have been.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I wish to make three rapid remarks on this ninth report, followed by a brief reflection on future reports.</p>
      <p sl="es">The remarks are positive remarks. First I wish to say that, although this report follows the structure of previous versions, there is greater concern for detailed analysis. Some issues are even examined from a dual perspective: geographical and thematic. This is a positive feature.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, another positive feature is the report’s increased emphasis on abolishing the death penalty, torture, children’s rights and greater concern about the protection of human rights defenders.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should also be pleased with the increased concern about the particular vulnerability of women in situations of abuse, and consequently the need to reinforce their protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">My third remark is that this report covers the first year of the UN’s Human Rights Council. The EU has played an active role in the introduction of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, and this could create some extremely positive synergies.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I wish to share a reflection partially coinciding with the thoughts of Mrs Andrikienė. We are making good progress towards the establishment of a much more comprehensive diagnosis every year, but we still have a long way to go to turn this exhaustive and discerning analysis into more tangible and effective results of the European Union’s action.</p>
      <p sl="es">This means, therefore, that we must develop a conceptual and analytical device that allows us to assess our own instruments. The way in which we approach dialogue with third countries, conditionality, the terms of the discourse we use to speak out against certain situations, whether or not we apply double standards depending on the proportions or the strategic importance of such-and-such a country, all of this we feel ought to be thoroughly examined, and we hope it is considered in future versions of our annual reports.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think the European Parliament has started off well towards the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the impressive Mr Salih Mahmoud Osman.</p>
      <p sl="de">But he told us that we are failing in our duty to offer protection to the people of Darfur and that the EU needed to put determination and resources, including troops, into that effort. How can it be that an EU that preaches human rights allows the murder of 600 000 people and the displacement of four million? The EU must build up its capacity to intervene in crisis situations such as this. Without action, our words on the promotion of shared values are so much hot air. I think many of my constituents and the suffering people of Darfur will have been astonished at the sight of EU leaders enjoying cocktails in Lisbon last weekend with the Presidents of both Zimbabwe and Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="de">A major gap in the Council and Commission’s 2007 human rights report is any response to the revelations, not least by this Parliament, of EU governments’ collusion in extraordinary rendition. We are told that the EU has been active on the issue of torture. How can it be that an EU that stands for human rights and the elimination of torture has offered no true accountability or establishment of the truth, but only blank denials and bland assurances for its own involvement in this barbarity? The signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights this week – welcome as it is, not least as it will be the first time that sexual orientation discrimination is banned in an international human rights instrument – rings hollow if we see hypocrisy in practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, Mr Osman also warned that justice and accountability must not be compromised by a political deal and that the cycle of impunity must be broken. I think we can apply that warning to the current situation in the Balkans. The European Union must not allow itself to be blackmailed by Serbia into signing the Association Agreement as a sweetener for the loss of Kosovo, unless and until Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karadžić are delivered to The Hague. We cannot sweep aside the judgment of Hague prosecutor Carla Del Ponte that the Serbian Government has deliberately failed to deliver Mladić and Karadžić to justice. We cannot reward Serbia for holding back from a violent reaction over Kosovo.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, defence of human rights should be a matter of conscience, rather than of keeping up with whatever the latest intellectual fashion happens to be. I therefore call for the European Union’s activities in this area to be imbued with greater sensitivity towards the issue of religious freedom. Believers’ consciences are coming under attack ever more frequently, and the problem has now reached dramatic proportions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I could mention China, Burma, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Vietnam and also Russia, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Cuba. Is that a long enough list? It is therefore striking that so little attention is devoted to this problem, especially in the first part of the report. I welcome the fact that gender issues and children’s rights have been prioritised on our agenda, but regret the lack of attention to religious freedom. This may be interpreted as an indication that certain people in Europe are prejudiced against faith per se .</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union should develop general guidelines on religious freedom as a matter of urgency. Religious freedom is the human right most commonly infringed with impunity in the contemporary world.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I welcome this annual report. It is an important piece of work providing us with a comprehensive view of the initiatives taken over one year and two presidencies to implement EU policy on human rights. It is obviously no mean feat: it is a practical tool and a reference document.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For all that, I feel Mrs Andrikienė is right. The report lacks a certain amount of objective appraisal, analysis and critical spirit, and as it does not draw any conclusions from the issues it considers, it lacks any recommendations. The successes or failures of this policy are not sufficiently developed in the report. That, I hope, and I feel sure this will be the case, will be the work of Members in the report to be drawn up by Parliament in the spring: their work must move in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are also some disturbing silences in this report. As Mrs Ludford mentioned, the section on human rights in relation to the fight against terrorism fortunately concludes with a reference to Parliament’s work on CIA flights and extraordinary renditions, but it says nothing about the Council’s lack of action in pursuing inquiries, charges against those responsible, and even less about compensation for the victims unjustly transferred, imprisoned or tortured.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Likewise, the section on asylum and migration says nothing about the mass violations of the rights of migrants; no assessment is made of the implementation of agreements for a series of readmissions, nothing on the quasi-militarised administration of borders, nothing on the thousands of people who die trying to reach our coasts, although the work of Members is extensive and regular on these issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nor, on reading this report, can one understand the reasons why our Member States have placed themselves in an extremely embarrassing position vis-à-vis our partners and vis-à-vis international law by refusing outright to ratify the Convention on migrant workers and their families. On these issues our internal policy has consequences on human rights outside our borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which will help us take a much wiser look at ourselves, including Great Britain and Poland. Analysis of our successes could also be useful for inspiring our future strategies. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is right: the decisive role of the EU in the UN Human Rights Council’s adoption of promising and demanding work mechanisms, such as the recent adoption of a resolution calling for a moratorium on the death penalty, must be analysed. An active presidency, a mobilised Council, a European Parliament on the offensive and tenacious civil organisations are helping fashion Europe as an effective world player: this is very good and encouraging news.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, ‘a new man of human rights has been born who has nothing in common with his ancestor of 1789 but the name’: that was the piqued description used by the philosopher Marcel Gauchet to describe the Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed here and made binding made by Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that in many respects the large number of rights it contains contradict the rights and freedoms protected by our national constitutions. European law is superior to national law, even constitutional law. In that case, what will be left of the secular principle when faced with Article 10 of the Charter, which states that religious freedom includes freedom to manifest one’s religion both publicly and privately? What will be left of the principle of equality when faced with Article 20 and subsequent articles of the Charter, which draw up a catalogue of victims’ rights based on their belonging to a particular group? What will be left of the principle of liberty, which includes the right to self-determination, when faced with Articles 6 to 19 which confuse this with personal rights and the simple power to demand a service from others?</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are trying to do is speed up the transformation of citizens who control their own future into mere consumers, passive service-providers, and we could not do this any better. To my fellow Members who appreciate their countries’ secular freedoms and rights as protected by their constitutions, I can only say two words: wake up.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, a human rights policy that is not consistent is hypocritical and lacks credibility. The European Union is right to want to support human rights in third countries, but to be credible, we must also respect all fundamental democratic rights among ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We do not always do that, especially in the case of the right to freedom of expression. That right is one of the most basic rights, if not the most basic right, but it is increasingly being seen as a problem. In particular, criticism of the failed immigration and integration policy is always labelled as racism and so is criminalised.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report we are discussing now also makes this mistake. People risk being prosecuted and convicted, not because of something they have done, but because of their opinions and the expression of those opinions. In this way the policy being pursued does not produce solutions to the problems, but the policy itself becomes part of the problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am grateful for this report, but would like to point out that our human rights are still selective – they are politically correct. Even in this House we could not hold a photographic exhibition on the atrocities in Chechnya, because we were afraid that the Russians would not like it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning our human rights dialogue with China, there was no mention of the 30 to 40 million girls who are missing, demographically-speaking, in China. Where are those children? They have been aborted, murdered after birth or abandoned, or are in the hands of organised crime. Therefore, next time, our mission should be to take up this matter with the Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Are things any better in the EU? I by no means want to make anyone feel guilty. All I am asking is for you to consider what the basis of humanity is. Why do we point a finger – quite rightly – at those countries which have the death sentence when we also have a death sentence in the EU, with over one million children in the EU being murdered before they can be born? All I am asking is whether this is humane. Can we build a sounder society when human life does not have an absolute value?</p>
      <p sl="en">Our first mission is to defend the defenceless, those who are the most vulnerable. That is called real solidarity. This may not be politically correct thinking, but we have to ask where the values lie. Are they negotiable? Can human rights values depend on a majority reached one day, which may be a minority another day? To put it simply, the first human right is to be born. I am very happy I was born, and I am sure my colleagues are happy that they were born. By seeing the absolute value of human life, we can build a society of compassion and love. We cannot build a better tomorrow on sand that is wet from the tears of unborn children.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we have before us the EU Annual Report on Human Rights. This is an excellent report. It is actually one of the best documents produced recently in the European Union and is a positive example of coordinated action in the area of human rights across the main European institutions, in this case the Council and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union’s policy on human rights is the best developed of all its policies. It symbolises what the European Union stands for in contemporary civilisation at the start of the 21st century, over and above the common market. The European Union does speak with one voice on human rights on the international stage. It has no hesitation about presenting its own stance that is not always in line with that of the United States. The Union is proving increasingly effective and helpful to individuals persecuted under undemocratic regimes the world over.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nonetheless, Mr President, we do realise that much still remains to be done. The winner of this year’s Sakharov Prize, Mr Salih Mahmoud Mohamed Osman, has made this clear for instance in today’s address to the House. We should consider what action is required to make the European Union’s human rights policy more effective. I have in mind in particular a study of the situation regarding human rights in Russia following the elections in that country. I am also thinking of the situation in China in the run-up to the Olympic Games due to take place there next year. There is a lot for the European Union to do there, especially regarding human rights.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council said that human rights issues should be taken into account in all policy. That is true, and that is what should happen in foreign affairs, but the EU should also take a look in its own backyard. Are foreign workers within the EU treated in a way that takes account of everyone’s human rights? There is much poverty here. In fact, that does not come under the EU’s official policy. It is outsourced to the Church and charities. The EU must take a more determined stand on human rights; only deeds mean anything, not words.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I would like to raise the issue of the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, which is about to reach catastrophic proportions. Some 4.5 million people have had to leave their homes, and the Iraqis last year represented the largest group of asylum seekers in Europe. The EU has responded to the crisis by allocating EUR 4 million to the work of the UN Refugee Agency and the Netherlands Red Cross, and a further EUR 11 million is planned for the country’s health services and schools. Is this sufficient support, however, from a rich European Union for these 4.5 million people who are, through no fault of their own, in such a plight? The Iraq crisis is now one of the world’s worst.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in this report I particularly welcome the section on the actions of Members of this Parliament. The award of the Sakharov Prize to Alexander Milinkievich, along with the strong and unequivocal condemnation of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya showed that Europe will not stand idly by, ignoring infringements of human rights beyond our Eastern border. Much remains to be done in this regard, however.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The latest parliamentary elections in Russia proved that fundamental principles and freedoms are being infringed there as a matter of course. The events that took place in Russia call into question the regular consultations between the European Union and the Russian Federation in the area of human rights. The time has perhaps come to redefine the nature of these meetings, to introduce sanctions for lack of progress in implementing commitments made and to establish mechanisms for monitoring their implementation. One thing is certain. Russia is moving ever further away from democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We can but hope that next year we will have more grounds for congratulating ourselves on not having wasted time and opportunities to make the world a better place.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the report contains good innovations. There is, for example, a chapter on the European Neighbourhood Policy. The report also describes the worsening human rights situation in Russia but sounds a warning against any moves to isolate that country. Nevertheless, it is important that subsequent dialogues should involve further discussion of issues such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and religious freedom, anti-NGO and anti-extremist legislation, the fight against terrorism and the Chechnya question. The Council and the Commission should establish a follow-up mechanism. Moreover, there is a complete lack of willingness on the Russian side to engage with the NGOs. We must hope that the Russian Government will agree at long last to take part in the consultations leading up to the human rights dialogues.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report shows that the EU has become more active in the field of human rights, but it regrettably misses the opportunity to engage in more critical reflection on the human rights situation within the EU itself. That, however, needs to be done if we are to pursue a credible policy on human rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the European institutions for drawing up this report, which represents a true indicator of the importance the European Union gives to human rights and the promotion of democratic values worldwide. It is a detailed report and I appreciate the initiative to extend it to other fields as well. At the same time, in the same theme of improvement, I would like to point out three aspects of major importance, which should be the priority of European action in the future.</p>
      <p sl="ro">First of all, I would like to emphasize the importance of promoting and respecting human rights, in the capacity of peace guarantor in Europe. Today’s Europe is a globalized and multiethnic Europe, and recognition and mutual respect of our rights and freedoms should lay at the basis of promoting tolerance and understanding. Therefore, guaranteeing the rights of minorities, especially in the Western Balkans and in the Neighbourhood Policy, as well as intensifying the European Union’s efforts in this direction, is of major importance.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, promoting the rights of the Roma and their integration into the European community, including by creating an agency responsible in this field, should continue to be consolidated.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The situation of human rights on the territory of the European Union, which aspires to the role of human rights promoter, is not less important and, therefore, of reference. In this regard, I express my concern regarding the recent deterioration of the situation of Romanians in Italy, which has resulted in massive infringement of their rights. Therefore, I request the Commission and the Council to take firm actions in order to restore the rights of Romanians and prevent this type of situation in the future.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the end, I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the need to consolidate the European Union evaluation mechanisms within the annual human rights reports. Only by knowing concrete results will we be able to develop these actions in a coherent and efficient manner. Also, the examination and evaluation of the European Union’s regional actions, including in developing the Black Sea synergy, should be integrated in the future reports.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I also welcome this year’s Council and Commission annual report. It certainly makes progress in terms of extra detail, which we have called for in past years. But, if I can say so, it is still a little longer on description and a little shorter on analysis than we would like.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I want to wholeheartedly congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on their new guidelines on the rights of the child – a major step forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope in the next year that successive presidencies will ensure an effective role for the Fundamental Rights Agency and the upgrading of EU legislation to provide effective protection against discrimination on all grounds, and maintain pressure on the countries of the Western Balkans to bring war criminals to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to call today for specific European support in the next year for the final report of the UN Secretary-General’s personal representative on business and human rights. As Parliament’s rapporteur on this issue, I am deeply concerned that in Bangalore this week Indian courts will seek to execute an international arrest warrant against seven Dutch activists from the Clean Clothes Campaign because they posted a report on labour violations at the Indian supplier of the fashion label G-Star, including forced overtime and physical and verbal abuse, on the internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is in contradiction of the Indian Government’s responsibilities under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I ask the Council and Commission to investigate this case, and I appeal for all EU governments not to cooperate with this arrest warrant on a fundamental issue both of labour rights and of freedom of speech.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the report contains information on talks with Russian and Chinese leaders regarding respect for human rights. Unfortunately, the information is not very specific. In the meantime, the conflict between the police and the army in Russia over organs belonging to Chechens continues. Chechens are being seized from their homes, and when all organs suitable for transplantation have been removed from their bodies, they are dumped.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In China, organs are taken from political prisoners. The Council of Europe issued statements on these cases earlier in the year. All our Parliament managed to do was dismantle a display illustrating crimes committed by Russia against the Chechen people. The display was taken down one evening because it was deemed too shocking. I should stress that it was the display that was considered too shocking, not the actions it illustrated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">How long will we condone genocide? I should like to ask for clarification as to whether the problem I have referred to was raised in the talks with Russia and China.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I must congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on this report which contains a detailed description of the valuable work carried out, in particular, for me, the moratorium on the death penalty. However, it is lacking one critical and, above all, self-critical analysis. I am referring to the lack of a response from the European Council on the recommendations of this Parliament and Senator Dick Marty on the so-called CIA flights. Despite having been confronted with proof that the territory and agents of various Member States are implicated in the kidnap and torture of terrorism suspects, who were therefore denied justice, the European Council, and the Portuguese Presidency in particular, have done nothing to date to properly find out what happened, to apportion blame and to prevent such criminal actions happening again.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Despite admissions and investigations in the US, the European governments still have their heads firmly in the sand, thus offending basic European values and interests and seriously compromising Europe’s credibility in terms of the universal promotion of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to say how glad I am that my country, Poland, decided to withdraw its reservation regarding establishing World Day Against the Death Penalty. Not only does this decision accurately reflect the feelings of the Polish people, but it also allows the Union to speak with one voice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">With regard to the report before us, I welcome its Chapter 4.5, entitled Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. It is good that the European Commission included gender equality and women’s rights amongst its priorities and action frameworks for 2010. Every Member State must now keep these issues in mind and take them into account in all political initiatives and cooperative actions aimed at development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We would do well to consider the situation on the ground with regard to these issues. Can we really feel satisfied when we hear what is actually happening? I could refer for instance to a 24-year-old Iranian woman named Delaram Ali who was sentenced to 32 months in jail and 10 lashes simply because she took part in a demonstration against the persecution of women. In addition, in July of this year, the bodies of 42 women were found in Basra. How do we react to the fact that those women were murdered simply because they had failed to cover their heads or had worn make-up? Surely we cannot condone the needless deaths of those women?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief. Firstly, on the report presented and debated here today and on the manner of this debate, I must thank you for your support. In fact more than that, I must thank you for your recognition of the work carried out by the Council, the Commission and also the General Secretariat of the Council in preparing this report and its contents. The comments we have heard have been music to our ears as they have recognised the detail, the merits and the effort put into this report. We have also heard criticisms, specifically that we could here and there have improved the analysis and gone deeper into the causes and consequences. This report is definitely heading that way: it is more analytical, or aims to be so, than previous reports and you should not be in any doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that we will continue along these lines as you have advised and suggested.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Comments were also made on the substance. There was one Member who said that Europe has done something, or has done a great deal, but there is still a long way to go. I believe that Europe is probably the greatest area of freedom, justice, human rights and rule of law. It has followed a consistent and constant path in its ever stronger and more solid defence of human rights. However, it is clear that there is always more that can be done because we will never reach the end in terms of freedom and human rights: there will always be something to defend, to develop, to protect and to safeguard. However, we should recognise that, both internally and also externally, the European Union has done a great deal. A recent case was cited: the decisions or measures that we have adopted in the area, for example, of the protection of children’s rights. We have done this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also point out four or five initiatives in the area of human rights that indisputably prove what the EU is trying to do in terms of defending these human rights. Here, tomorrow, we will solemnly proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In this half of 2007, the European Union has secured the adoption, in the United Nations, of a resolution on a moratorium on the death penalty. We have established the European Agency of Fundamental Rights which is in its final stages of preparation. We have also created the European Day Against the Death Penalty. These are concrete, specific and recent examples of how our work to defend human rights is continuous, persistent and solid. We must accept that there will be problems and that there will be measures or actions or attitudes that may be less than perfect!</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet we must also recognise the great successes that we have had in this area. Specifically in terms of external action, reference was made to the EU-Africa Summit which will be debated next. There can be no doubt that the issue of human rights and good governance was an important, in fact, a very important issue in the dialogue that we held in Lisbon during the EU-Africa Summit. You all know, ladies and gentlemen, as do all European citizens, that, in our dialogue with third countries, the issue of the defence of human rights is a constant and priority theme on our agenda and in our bilateral dialogue. This is proven by our condemnation whenever violations of human rights occur in third countries and by the measures that we have taken in response to violations of human rights in third countries, in particular by adopting sanctions which are specifically aimed at preventing these violations from reoccurring. We should therefore recognise our merits and the efforts that we have made. Of course we must also correct what can be corrected, but we should have, on this issue, a confident and positive attitude and a belief that we are on the right road in line with our humanist traditions.</p>

    <intervention id="2-270" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Benita Ferrero-Waldner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, before responding to some of the issues that have been mentioned here in the debate, let me say that we have brought a number of copies for you, just in case you would like them. They are available.</p>
      <p sl="en">Going into the discussion, let me begin with the general remarks about the report. I am glad many of you find it a useful report and we also take note of the suggestions and the recommendations that you mentioned in this debate. On the question of analysing the effectiveness of our own policy, which was raised by some of you, I would just like to point out that, in Chapter 7, which is dedicated to this issue, there are evaluations and analysis, but it is also true that we can do better; we can do more. Let me also say that there is a certain limit, because very often human rights questions also relate to changing the whole society, therefore they are not as easily measurable as other things that are quickly implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also say a few things in general. Religious freedoms have been mentioned. The European Union is, of course, strongly against discrimination affecting any religious groups and our dialogue with third countries is expected to reinforce the respective governments’ own efforts to pursue and apply human rights principles, including, for instance, through national institutions for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the other questions that have been mentioned here, for instance the situation of the Roma in the candidate countries, it is stated in this annual report that we are committed to respecting fully the human rights of all persons, including those belonging to minorities. Roma communities, in the mean time, have been identified as one of the most vulnerable minorities, both within the EU and in the candidate countries. I think we still have to go on to tackle this question and to have it improved.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was also the question about renditions in general. In our opinion, practices referred to as ‘renditions’ or ‘secret detention’ constitute a violation of fundamental rights. This has been clearly mentioned. Here the Commission has from the beginning actively supported and facilitated the investigations launched by both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament into the renditions and the secret detentions. I would just like to mention that here. Things have been done.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Sudan: we heard Mr Osman here today. One of the key elements of the joint strategy at the summit was the question of partnership on security and peace. Here we provide substantial support for conflict prevention, peace operations, and reinforcement of Africa’s capacity to tackle conflicts at regional and national level. President Barroso and Commissioner Michel have used every opportunity, including the last Africa-EU Summit, to remove remaining obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was present today when Mr Osman spoke and he also expressly said that he has received a lot of support from the delegations of the European Commission. So there is great support there, but, of course, one can always do more.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the human rights situation in Iraq, which was also mentioned here: we know that this is still an alarming situation, particularly in the light of the bad security situation there and also with regard to women, children, minorities and displaced persons. Here, I think, good governance, democracy, human rights and the rule of law are the focus of our policies, in order for them to slowly go in the right direction. We have often called on them concerning the abolition of the death penalty. This is just to highlight a few of those issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Russia: we hold EU-Russia human rights consultations twice a year and Russia is also mentioned in our report twice, on pages 72 and 73: first consultations were highlighted, and, secondly, we spoke clearly on the human rights situation, including in Chechnya. So, again, Chechnya is not forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finally say a word on India. We are aware of the legal action that has been taken by Fibres and Fabrics International against the Clean Clothes Campaign. This issue is particularly important to those of the Commission’s directorates-general that are concerned with fair labour practices. We have asked the Commission delegation in Delhi to keep us apprised of the situation that is proceeding in the Indian courts, and we have to look into the detention that has been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">There remains a lot more to be said, but I think it was a broad debate and I do not want to take up any more time.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner Michel, ladies and gentlemen, the second EU-Africa Summit that was held last weekend in Lisbon was undoubtedly a success and marked the start of a new relationship between the European Union and Africa based on strategic dialogue. Almost 80 Heads of State and Government, the Presidents of the European Parliament and Pan-African Parliament and representatives of civil society sent strong messages to the European people, to the African people and to the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The concrete expression of the new relationship between the EU and Africa can be found in the documents – in my opinion high-quality documents – that were adopted at the summit: the Joint Strategy, the Action Plan and the Lisbon Declaration. These documents set out the specific details of the relationship between Europe and Africa. The new approach firstly favours multilateral channels and, secondly, tries to deal in an integrated manner with all the various dimensions of the relationship. This approach constitutes the difference that the EU can bring, particularly in comparison with other international actors.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The treatment of Africa as a partner in strategic dialogue was also reflected in the method followed when both preparing for the summit and producing the documents that this summit was to adopt. The strategy – for the first time a genuinely joint strategy – and the action plan were the result of intense and in-depth work with the African side, in particular with the African Union, and were, in the end, prepared and concluded by a joint group of experts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must also highlight at this point the constructive role played by the European Parliament in the process of producing the documents and preparing for the Lisbon Summit. The Joint Strategy identifies four interlinked areas of common concern: peace and security, democratic governance and human rights, trade and regional integration, and development. For the initial period from 2008 to 2010, the first action plan provides for eight partnerships in areas of common concern which primarily aim to have a positive impact on the day-to-day lives of African and European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Lisbon Summit confirmed the major changes that have occurred in Europe, Africa and the world. In the Europe of today, with 27 Member States, there are very diverse external policy priorities and approaches. The African Union is emerging as a favoured discussion partner of the EU, with the agenda also including the issue of human rights and good governance. There is also a widespread perception that a series of global challenges, such as peace, security and international trade, require concerted action on the part of the international community, thereby justifying the emergence of new forms of cooperation. The same can be said with regard to finding answers to problems affecting both Europe and Africa, in particular the effects of climate change, management of energy resources and migration flows.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Africa and the EU understand that there is a need to raise their relations to a new level, with the summit representing the moment when this common desire became clear and unequivocal. However, the second EU-Africa Summit must not be presented as the end of the road, but rather as the turning point in relations between the two continents.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, of particular importance in the documents adopted, especially to guarantee a medium- and long-term view, is the explicit reference to the follow-up mechanisms for decisions made. In addition to setting a three-year frequency for these summits, sectoral ministerial and expert meetings are planned for the various areas of the action plan, together with regular contacts between the Commissions of the European Union and the African Union. However, civil society, NGOs, trade unions, business forums and think tanks will also have a very important role to play in implementing and monitoring the planned measures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I must stress the central role of the European and Pan-African Parliaments in implementing the new partnership. Existing ties between the parliamentary representatives of Europe and Africa must now be reinforced. The Presidency is delighted, as you must be aware, at the joint statement presented by the Presidents of the two Parliaments at the second EU-Africa Summit. There can be no doubt that a new and very exciting road is opening up in the relationship between Europe and Africa following the Lisbon Summit.</p>

    <intervention id="2-275" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to report to you on the results of the Lisbon Summit. There is not much more to add since I feel that the President-in-Office of the Council has described the results splendidly. I also wish to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency for arranging and organising this summit – as I feel it was urgently needed – and especially for its great success.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The summit evidently brought home a new and clear message: that of a radical change in relations between Africa and Europe. The Lisbon Summit marked the adoption, as has already been said, of a new common vision within a joint strategy, a political partnership of equals – complex-free, liberated and pragmatic – and a mutual responsibility. Having said that, the summit also adopted eight strategic plans to specifically implement this new vision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The summit featured intense, rich, high-quality debates pointing to the new nature of our relationship, and thus its genuinely and essentially political nature. Yes, we discussed Zimbabwe, and many new European leaders, such as President Barroso and Chancellor Merkel, made it clear that Mr Mugabe’s policy is totally unacceptable, that we cannot tolerate violations of human rights, and that the policy operated there damages the desires for reform on the African continent. Many African leaders share these criticisms, and I feel the EU ought to lend its full support to African mediation under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and led by President Mbeki.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, we talked about Darfur and the unacceptable humanitarian and security situation, and we criticised the uncooperative attitude of the Sudanese Government. At a troika meeting with the President of Sudan, we clearly set out our expectations and demands for him to take the decision to permit rapid deployment of the hybrid force in order to put an end, as soon as possible, to the violence we know is being committed there. It should be noted that, as a general rule, democracy, governance and human rights are no longer taboo, and many African countries have embarked on the road to progress, as they say, not in response to Europe’s expectations, but in response to the expectations of their own people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, we also talked about economic partnership agreements (EPAs), and yes, agreements were reached with many African leaders. President Barroso and I explained time and again the real issues behind EPAs. We also explained that the real challenge in the short term is to draw up interim agreements, not EPAs, before 1 January to ensure compatibility with WTO rules and thus prevent non-least-developed countries (non-LDCs) from being left in a more unfavourable situation as of 1 January 2008. I was told about the example of the Côte d’Ivoire which would have lost around 750 million euros in commodities trade if it had not drawn up the interim agreement. President Barroso suggested that next year the EPA discussions should be held at the highest level with each of the regions concerned, to finalise the agreements with a view to reasonable economic integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are, of course, difficult issues. We brought them up with no fear of divergence. I feel that this will obviously give our new partnership quality and depth but, ladies and gentlemen, as of tomorrow we will face the even greater challenge of transforming this new political vision into specific action. It is our political duty to present specific results by 2010, in other words when we meet up again for the Third EU-Africa Summit. We have a collective obligation to produce results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The joint strategy and the first action plan form the roadmap for our partnership and divide it into very specific, operational, thematic objectives, as the President said. These two joint documents adopted at the summit were unanimously welcomed in view of their quality and their ambitious nature. This success is the result of a very long period of preparatory work which began in December 2005 with a communication by the Commission on a strategy for Africa, which in 2007 became the EU-Africa joint strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission fully intends to assume its responsibilities during the implementation phase. Success, however, is not only the responsibility of the Commission. The Member States and our African partners must ensure that their mechanisms are in full working order. One of Europe’s major responsibilities in implementing this partnership will consist of mobilising funds for finance. I wish to remind you that the Member States undertook to disburse an additional 20 billion euros per year by 2010. The latest results show we are on the right track but that, if we take account of the effect of debt cancellation in certain countries, the current good results are quite relative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, one very important aspect is a better distribution of the work between donors. This is why the Code of Conduct on Division of Labour is a vital component.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, I also wish to remind you that the Member States committed themselves at Gleneagles to finding one billion euros per year for Aid for Trade, half of which must be paid over to Africa. These are public political commitments. I wish to remind you of this because these are components that will consolidate the feasibility and achievement of the strategic plans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have another thought on this subject: it is now clear that the commitment of the Commission and the Member States must not be the monopoly of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs or of the Ministers for Development. I would like us to institutionalise the principle of joint and regular sectoral ministerial meetings on these issues. Obviously sectoral ministers, for example in the areas of scientific research, trade, agriculture and finance can make an enormous contribution to the new relationship with African countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I explained at the conference of the European and Pan-African Parliaments in Lisbon, we are also relying heavily on the European Parliament and the African and European national parliaments to gather and relay the opinions and expectations of civil societies. The central place given over to democratic actors and African and European civil societies at the very heart of the strategic partnership and its implementation is also an innovative feature which I hope will produce a genuine partnership focusing on people. The speeches by the Presidents of the European and Pan-African Parliaments to the Heads of State and Government marked the official implementation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also wish to tell you that I took due note of the request by your colleagues in the Pan-African Parliament for financial support for this institution with respect for its autonomy. We are obviously willing to consider, with the budgetary authorities, more direct access to finance. I reiterate to you my hope that one day we may include the European Development Fund in the budget, for I think it is right and fair for you to perform your function of democratic control over the process of allocating public development funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, before the summit I said that the main challenge there would be to strike the right note on this EU-Africa political partnership and send out a clear message of a complex-free, joint and pragmatic relationship. I think this is precisely the message emerging from the Lisbon Summit. As the Portuguese Prime Minister José Socrates said, I have the feeling there will be a before-Lisbon and an after-Lisbon in relations between the EU and Africa.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the summit is behind us, a historic moment, a turning point in our relationship with Africa. The basis of the relationship has really changed: from domination to cooperation, from monologue to dialogue. It is right to talk about a partnership of equals. After all, both Europe and Africa have a responsibility when it comes to the development of Africa. Europe is responsible for European policy; the African governments are responsible for their policies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A joint strategy, based on shared values and mutual respect, and geared to the welfare of people, was sorely needed. A joint strategy was also needed to enable us to tackle the problems that affect both continents together. I am pleased that the summit was not taken hostage by Mugabe. The situation in Zimbabwe is unacceptable and it is right that his policies are severely criticised. However, the summit was not just about Zimbabwe. There are other disasters going on in Africa which are claiming many victims. Just think of Darfur, Somalia and, let us not forget, the Congo.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Parliament adopted its report on the strategy in October. The joint declaration of Parliament and the pan-African Parliament was signed at the parliamentary pre-summit . Both presidents presented this at the opening session of the summit. The parliaments should indeed not only have a role in preparing the strategy, they also have an important monitoring role with respect to its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When it comes to the action plan, unfortunately this is still vague, as are the issues of financing and the structural involvement of the parliaments. I am pleased with the Commissioner’s promises on this. The action plan talks about seminars, studies and evaluations. They are all very important but ultimately it is about the results. We all know that there is enough water, know-how and money to give Africa a better existence. A great deal is dependent on political will. Let this strategy be a genuine new start for sustainable development in Africa.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I wish to add my congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency. It was completely wrong that for seven years the world’s largest trading entity and the poorest continent had not sat down together to talk. That stumbling block has now been overcome. The summit has been held and has doubtless achieved many successes, the first success being that it was actually held.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Parliaments, and this House especially, are ready to take our inspiration onto the stage, as we say in Spanish, meaning to match words with actions. However, Commissioner, I regret that the reference to the parliamentary dimension was mere lip service, for none of the requests we made at the previous summit in relation to specific courses of action and funds to develop the role of the Parliaments were included in the summit’s conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Despite this, the House will continue to work and point out areas where we have not done well. It must be said we have not done well in connection with those famous economic partnership agreements. What has happened is that we have a complex-free relationship, a relationship of equals. Certain African leaders have clearly stated the problems posed by some of the approaches we have fiercely defended. It is not enough to be right, or to have reasons. What we have to do is reach agreement. Agreements are agreements, and cannot be impositions. We ought to work harder and better to secure agreements on this equal footing that we proclaimed in the spirit of the summit. This trade disagreement will go down in history as one of the main features of this summit.</p>
      <p sl="es">The other main feature was human rights. Substance was in short supply here too. Yes, Commissioner, you discussed Darfur, but not much. Not much, no, and in fact nearly not at all, because some of us here had to write to remind you that it was not on the agenda, and that it was a disgrace that Africa and Europe should meet up and not discuss Darfur. Once again people were concerned, but did not actually concern themselves much in practice. As we were reminded this morning, it is certainly time for us to be concerned, but it is also time for us to concern ourselves much more, and more effectively too.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to come back to the interparliamentary encounter between the Pan-African and European Parliaments to comment on two points where a common vision is needed within a common strategy. As in love, words are not enough: we need action and proof. Thus I feel there are two points where we could implement a common vision to really make it part of a common strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first point, Commissioner, as you said, is budgetary control. Our job is to control outgoing funds and so it is absolutely essential, and it is up to us, to include the European Development Fund (EDF) in the budget in such a way as to allow parliamentary control to be exercised. Our outgoing funds are, of course, incoming funds for our colleagues in the African parliaments. It is vital that they can use national parliamentary controls to handle incomings which, particularly in a budget-support policy, can often be an important lever in their national policies. It is high time, therefore, for us to get down to including the EDF in the budget and provide them with budgetary control mechanisms, with assistance if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point I wish to make concerns joint action within the context of international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law – as you said, Commissioner – is flouted and trampled on, and this is totally unacceptable, and it is often for the extremely surprising reason that there is a war on. International humanitarian law is precisely a law which is applied only in a war situation: it is not a law for times of peace. Thus on this issue we may all insist together, the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament in unison, that any person who has ever violated international humanitarian law, especially during a power struggle, cannot be excused, and that we can then impose sanctions on those responsible. These sanctions, however, will serve a genuine purpose and will be properly perceived only if they are transmitted on the ground in Africa, and if the kind of passive complicity we occasionally observe in such cases is curtailed. I believe our parliamentary colleagues would be honoured if we undertook joint reflection on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Presidency and also Commissioner Michel and the African leaders for all the progress that was made at the summit. I think very often we look at the negative side but I think that an awful lot of good things came out of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The theme that emerged from the summit was one of partnership. This was a summit of equals. But we must make sure that this is more than rhetoric. Let this pledge to partnership be reflected in practice. To this end we should both demand equal standards from our partners on human rights and deal with them as equals on trade and economic issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want to build a new strategic partnership with Africa, one that helps to establish a peaceful and secure future for the people of Africa, one that helps to strengthen investment, growth and prosperity through closer economic ties, and one that is based on a shared vision of Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before the summit there were some concerns about President Mugabe – but I do believe that he got the message very clearly – and also about EPAs. I know that I was delighted to hear the Commissioner say that he and President Barroso had explained and re-explained to African leaders the benefits of this. I want to thank him again for the meeting that I and other groups had with him. They were very clear on the advantages of EPAs for the long-term economic future of Africa and, obviously, for the people of Africa.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like once again to congratulate the people involved in the summit and I think a lot of momentum and progress has been made.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish first of all to say that we in the European Parliament delegation attended two summits: first the parliamentary pre-summit with our colleagues from the Pan-African Parliament, and also the official summit. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think you cannot be aware of the status we had there, in other words the degrading status of observers: Members of the European Parliament, even if they had worked well on previous occasions, had no access to the official summit. I very much wished to inform the House of this, and I feel that we, as Members of the European Parliament, represent European citizens in the same capacity as heads of state or government. Thus it would be right if we were also represented at the next summit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The official summit, however, was a splendid initiative, and it is good to know that it has been held after seven years of failed attempts. I do feel, however, that the main lesson to be learned from the summit is that the African continent is finally becoming emancipated and organised as an African unit, and this is certainly good news. This reminds me of the discussions we had at our parliamentary pre-summit with the Commissioner, where we stressed the contradiction between, on the one hand, the political display of the EU’s vision and the new approach to its partners, and, on the other hand, the pressure exerted by the EU to get the economic partnership agreements signed. I now wish to ask the Commissioner about the status of these partnerships, these interim agreements to be signed, because I must remind you that the African countries rejected this type of agreement and this kind of pressure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Commissioner, another question on a matter of some concern: the nuclear issue. The question from the Group of the Greens is as follows: why did nuclear talks commence with African countries? African countries are now in need of renewable energy. Our technology, our solar energy, photovoltaic systems and wind-energy systems are truly suited to Africa. What, then, was the reason, particularly when we are aware of the difficulties this can entail, such as with Iran at the moment? Why, Mr Vice-President? This is a very important question. I would also like to know which country forced the EU to add the nuclear issue to the strategy. Was it my president, the worldwide nuclear sales representative? This is totally unbelievable. It is renewable forms of energy that Africa needs at the present time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we can be satisfied with what happened in Lisbon. At last, despite its differences – and after all we too have ours – Africa is showing that it is united and capable of overcoming the paternalistic relationship that arises between donor countries and recipient countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Building a political, economic and social partnership forms part of our strategy. We can therefore be pleased that what we have asserted in our documents ever since the Treaty of Rome in 1957 is today becoming a reality. Mr Konaré stated that Africa wishes to draw up its own agenda: this is quite extraordinary, and I hope it really does mean that Africa assumes responsibility for jointly tackling poverty, desertification and disease. Criticism of economic partnership agreements (EPAs) has long been expressed in this House, and in my opinion we should bear in mind that not only social groups but also African governments are now expressing such criticism and hence try to find alternatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Pan-African Parliament and the European Parliament have now entered the field with determination, with a joint statement, and this is something exceptional. It will also be a challenge, however, with regard to the policies to be pursued together with civil society organisations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Mugabe claimed a diplomatic victory at Lisbon in that he had ‘defeated the British’. In a way he was right. Instead of attending the conference himself, Gordon Brown sent Baroness Amos, who is, with no disrespect to the Baroness, a relatively minor figure in the British Government. In the same way, he will send his errand boy, Mr Miliband, off to Lisbon on Thursday to sign up to the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">It fell to Angela Merkel to rebuke Mr Mugabe with wonderful, almost British understatement that ‘Zimbabwe damages the image of the new Africa’. Well, you could certainly say that!</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Brown should have attended the conference and taken the opportunity to tell Mr Mugabe to his face that he is a bloodthirsty tyrant who has no place in the modern community of civilised nations. That would have given heart to oppressed Zimbabweans, and it would also have required real leadership – which is precisely why it did not happen.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to have the courage to see the truth before our eyes. The EU-Africa Summit last weekend was in fact a failure and you do not need to look far to find the reason why. People may well make fine statements about a new strategic partnership, but the fact is – as I said in Lisbon – that a satisfactory partnership between Europe and Africa has to be based on shared values and principles, such as democracy, human rights and good governance. That is not the case at all today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe rolls out the red carpet for Gaddafi and Mugabe: for Gaddafi in order to secure lucrative contracts, for Mugabe so as not to offend the other partners. However, if the member states of the African Union continue to support the dictator Mugabe openly, the question will arise as to what their own promises on democracy and human rights are actually worth. I will say it again therefore: if there is one signal that Europe should have given at this summit, it is that only democratic systems based on the rule of law offer a guarantee of improvement in one’s lot and that development aid should be made contingent upon the fulfilment of these conditions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we will only find out if the EU-Africa Summit was worth the effort in 2010 when the next summit will be held, depending on whether the issues discussed at that time are new or the same as today. That will be the criterion and the time for assessing the results of what happened this weekend in Lisbon. However, in the meantime, we can take stock to a certain extent.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This summit was presented as a summit for dialogue, genuinely bilateral partnership and common sharing of responsibilities. These are worthy aims. In the new relationship between Europe and Africa, there can be no one leader as Africans must be responsible for their own destiny. It is up to us, the European neighbours, to be generous and consistent in our development aid. If, in 2010, we are well on the way to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and if there are fewer deaths, less hunger, more democracy, more respect for human rights, more fair trade and more growth and development, then this summit will have been a success. If the same dictators are still in power and the same deals are still being done, bringing many benefits to very few, then it will sadly have been an opportunity lost.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, following the EU-Africa Summit I wish to make a few remarks as a kind of summary of this important encounter. As the Commissioner said, the results of the summit would certainly appear to be positive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, for months, or more than months, we have been asking the Commission to review the economic partnership agreement agenda and contents. On each occasion, the Commission, or Commission representatives, told us that our criticisms were not shared by any African government officials or partners, and that we were merely relaying, for I remember the response, the perverse arguments of a number of large NGOs. In Lisbon, there was a stream of criticism from the vast majority of African Heads of State and Government with regard to methodology and also the contents of negotiations. A clear call went out to take the time to sign up fair and balanced agreements in compliance with EU commitments towards African development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For a long time now we have been asking the Commission to ensure genuine coherence among its various policies. We agree that several decades of European development cooperation with Africa have failed, but we would maintain that the limits of this cooperation have been constantly set by the Commission, taking back in one area what it gave in another. Post-Lisbon, it is therefore obvious that the issue is not about substituting trade for cooperation, but about making both policies pursue the same objective of sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In relation to food security, the fight against disease, human rights and migration, especially support for more fragile states, we have also constantly asked the Commission to do more and better for and with Africa. We can see that this will be the case from now on, and that is good. It can no longer be ignored, however, that the demands of this Parliament are the demands of ordinary African citizens, and also of their political representatives. We are therefore pleased that the Parliaments, so long ignored in this process, have finally been included. We hope that the next summit will provide the opportunity to gauge the effectiveness of the new strategy more rapidly and without too much delay, in order to confirm the suitability of the objectives and achievements.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This summit took place because the Portuguese Presidency insisted and the African Union took a gamble. Those in Europe who wanted to diminish the summit on the pretext of Robert Mugabe’s presence in Lisbon have lost. Yet those who receive the King of Saudi Arabia in London with all due pomp and circumstance have no place to talk about human rights. At the same time as the summit, numerous civic actions denounced this duplicity of words and deeds, the duplicity of those who were missing but also of those who were there.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In Portugal, the summit allowed people to talk about Africa and its problems and only for this reason was it worth the effort. However, those who have listened to the Presidency and the Commission will believe that this was a genuinely historic event, a moment with a before and an after, which is clearly an exaggeration. In fact, for the Portuguese, this was a kind of Luso-tropicalist provincialism, as apparent from the European press. Progress was made: in fact, the main element of progress was that the African countries drew up their own agenda. However, in all other respects, there was a gaping hole between the vanity of the words and the meagreness of the results. This summit was better than the Cairo Summit, but that was hardly difficult! What is difficult is to accept joint responsibility when starting from the fixed idea of economic partnership agreements.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is good that the EU-Africa Summit has taken place. We see more clearly now. We have a strategy and a first action plan. We in the European Parliament shall monitor their implementation closely. As chairman of the delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament, I can tell you that we shall be doing that together with our African counterparts.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the realm of good governance, we issued a joint statement at our parliamentary pre-summit meeting which included an expression of our conviction that measures to strengthen the capacity of African parliaments would enable those institutions, which had previously been overlooked, to make an effective contribution to good governance and to scrutiny of policy implementation. To this end we need adequate resources to be earmarked in the specific programmes of the Commission and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">On human rights, we see Africans closing ranks whenever warranted criticism of conditions in specific countries is voiced in Europe. Sporadic remarks from delegates dissociating themselves from Robert Mugabe’s policies before the summit gave way to a united front at the summit itself. My thanks go to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, for expressing herself clearly on Zimbabwe on behalf of all of us.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of economic partnership agreements, however, I believe we have a real problem. It cannot be the aim of the EU to bring about the effective disintegration of the Southern African Development Community or the Southern African Customs Union by concluding interim agreements with some countries and not with others. On this subject, President Mbeki argues objectively, whereas on the subject of Zimbabwe he tends to adopt a more partisan stance. With regard to economic partnership agreements, I call on the Council to give the Commission a more flexible negotiating mandate so that unwanted effects like the interruption of trade flows for non-least-developed countries (non-LDCs) do not occur on 1 January simply because of the expiry of the present trade arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, WTO-compatibility is essential, but it must also be possible to exercise a certain degree of creativity in order to achieve it. Sometimes the stopwatch can be put on hold for a limited time. All of our countries, after all, are WTO members too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as Michael Gahler said, clearly the Summit was somewhat overshadowed by the fact that there have been these acrimonious negotiations over economic partnership agreements (EPAs) and a relationship has indeed been soured by these negotiations, as much as the Commissioner and the Council have tried to work for a good partnership.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of heads of state raised their concerns, including the head of the African Union, Mr Konaré, who said that the Commission was playing African regions one off against the other. The General Affairs Council this week – rather disappointingly, for some of us – did not recommend the flexibility that many of us wanted to see, particularly towards the non-least-developed countries (non-LDCs), although, as I understand it, the UK and the Netherlands in particular were pressing for this to happen. Still that sword of Damocles is poised over the heads of the non-LDCs and they face the consequences, both economic and social, and economic shocks which, for us, ought to be absolutely unthinkable.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are still concerns that have not been addressed on EPAs, on development assistance, on rules of origin and on commitments on the impact of agricultural subsidies. These are all things which the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states, in general, and Africa, in this case, were asking for. It is not enough for the Commission to say that those of us who criticise EPAs are somehow in the pockets of the non-governmental organisations, that the ACP states are misinformed and misled by people and that it is only trying to comply with World Trade Organisation rules. These kinds of argument really do not wash when we see the kind of dangerous situation the non-LDCs are in.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say, finally, that our citizens in Europe will not accept any situation where, in 2008, any poor countries are worse off than they are at the moment, and we cannot stand and allow that to happen. We urge the Commission to show flexibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, allow me to refer to some results of the summit which, I believe, reveal more than anything else the lack of a consistent development policy. The good frameworks that were created for the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals and climate goals are being demolished again by the build-up of pressure in relation to the economic partnership agreement negotiations and, to an even greater extent, by an energy policy driven by the needs of the conglomerates.</p>
      <p sl="de">Free trade agreements are to be wrung out of individual partners, which will ensure that even established regional economic areas in Africa are segmented once more. In the field of energy policy, the only concern is to serve the interests of major European investors, and the drive to export nuclear plants to Africa is, in my view, a scandal.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of management of migration, you have once again made significant promises. These, however, run counter to the draft directives on selective migration that Commissioner Frattini has presented. I believe there is an urgent need to withdraw these drafts, otherwise mobility and freedom of movement between Europe and Africa will remain a pipe dream.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Africa and Europe talked politics in Lisbon at the highest level, and this is very good news. Having said that, I would like to be sure they are speaking the same language, and particularly on three major issues. First of all, a partnership of equals. Alpha Konaré told the forum that Africa does not need either charity or paternalism. The Lisbon Declaration confirms this: we will be setting up a partnership of equals. Europe, however, has often treated this commitment rather lightly or à la carte by imposing its own agenda whenever its interests were at stake: on terrorism, migration and, at the present time, economic partnership agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, a partnership of peoples. We also expect some action on this issue. The new partnership must bring together civil societies much more systematically, and also the people’s representatives, in other words the parliaments, especially by assisting with the capacities of African parliaments. This is the message conveyed by the common statement made by the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament, and I hope this message will be heard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, in relation to migration: Europeans and Africans had the chance in Lisbon to send a clear political signal which would have placed human rights centre stage in our partnership. I truly believe that Lisbon was, regrettably, a missed opportunity. The new strategy still places the emphasis on protecting borders rather than on the rights of migrants. This means Europe can continue to flout the rights of migrants either here or there, for it has actually made very few commitments in its ‘Migration, Mobility and Employment’ action plan.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU-Africa Summit was held thanks to the diplomatic and political persistence of the Portuguese Presidency. Europe has reported a success but it is doubtful that Africa will do the same, particularly those men and women fighting oppressive and kleptomaniac regimes. They know that the majority of their representatives have absolutely no intention of abiding by what was legitimately agreed at the summit. Future trialling of the joint strategy and the action plan adopted will be in the hands of the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the terrible tragedies that Africa is facing in Darfur and Somalia were only briefly mentioned at the summit, we need to move on to practical measures. When will European forces advance into Chad, as promised for last summer? When will the EU take vigorous action against the Sudanese regime which is preventing the hybrid force mandated by the UN Security Council from protecting the civilian population in Darfur? When will European troops or other contributions be sent in to make the invading Ethiopian troops withdraw from Somalia, as decided by the UN Security Council?</p>
      <p sl="pt">The organisation of summits does not justify allowing such urgent issues to be forgotten, as this calls into question the EU’s credibility among millions of Africans and Europeans. We need to demonstrate that the protection of lives in the Sudan, in Somalia, in East Congo and other countries in Africa counts for more than the signature of contracts in the tents of the criminal Gaddafi.</p>

    <intervention id="2-293" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Manuel Lobo Antunes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, I am going to be frank as some Members have been, some more than others. The EU-Africa Summit was a success. Without the constraints of a written text, here are my comments. I remember very well when, at the beginning of the Portuguese Presidency or in fact during the preparations for the Portuguese Presidency, we indicated that holding an EU-Africa Summit was one of our objectives, there were comments, doubts and sometimes even criticisms expressed about us setting this summit as one of our objectives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Some said: ‘Africa does not raise, among public opinion, society, Member States or the institutions, the necessary interest and commitment for a summit to be held: you, the Presidency, will be alone with very little support. Africa is not on the international agenda and there is no interest’. Others said: ‘there are participative and organisational issues which will be difficult, if not insurmountable’. We were discouraged from taking this idea forward. However, the fact is that we managed to hold this summit, as we say in Portugal, ‘against wind and sea’, or in other words against all odds. We managed this because we did have the support of many Member States which collaborated with us, with the Presidency, in preparing the texts and also in the direct negotiation of the texts with the African representatives. We also had the support of the EU’s institutions, the Commission and Parliament, to the annoyance of the critics and sceptics. We also managed to resolve certain delicate and difficult diplomatic issues. I would not presume to say whether or not this summit was historic: that is for the future to tell us. However, there can be no doubt that this summit marks a new phase in the relationship between Europe and Africa and the fact that it was held was, in itself, a success.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As Commissioner Michel said, we did not avoid at this summit, in our comprehensive dialogue with Africa, the problems, difficulties and differences of opinion. On the contrary! We talked about the problems, the difficulties and what divides us. We talked about trade, security, conflicts and violations of human rights, eye to eye, with frankness and with transparency. However, the aim of the summit was obviously not to negotiate trade agreements – it was not the right place for that – and it was certainly not intended to immediately solve the problem of the Sudan. It was also not intended to immediately solve, with a wave of our magic wand, the situation in Zimbabwe. However, both sides together tackled these issues, discussed them, gave our opinions and, when there were differences, did not shy away from saying what these differences were.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The message conveyed by the European Union on all these issues was absolutely unequivocal. As you know, we discussed Sudan both in plenary and afterwards in a ministerial troika meeting. We also defended our position, the EU’s position, on economic partnership agreements. Mr Mitchell may have spoken on this issue in more depth and more detail, but we had the opportunity to clearly explain what the EU’s position is on economic partnership agreements. We are seeking agreements that are fair and balanced and that favour Africa and our African partners: that is our position and nothing else. We should be absolutely clear on this issue! What we are trying to do is respond to African concerns and aspirations and nothing else. Those who, in this respect, attack, criticise or devalue the effort being made by the Commission, and also the Council in support of the Commission, to conclude the largest possible number of economic partnership agreements by the end of this year are wrong.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Those who say, however, that the summit is not, in itself, the end of the road and that it will not, by itself, revolutionise relations with Africa are right. We need to follow up the decisions made, without any shadow of a doubt. The real value of this summit, its real importance, will be determined in the medium and long term by our capacity to fulfil what was agreed, decided and undertaken. We must therefore follow up the decisions that were taken. We must assess the results achieved and, only then, when this assessment has been made in the medium and long term, will we be able to properly say whether the summit was successful in terms of its consequences and effects.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As I have said, by agreeing a joint strategy, a specific action plan and concrete follow-up mechanisms, by discussing such important and current issues as climate change, integration, energy and immigration, the summit clearly represents a step forward, a maturing of our relationship with Africa. We waited seven years to get from Cairo to Lisbon. We are absolutely certain that we will not wait so long before we have another summit between Europe and Africa. The importance, usefulness and significance of this summit demonstrate, without any shadow of a doubt, the need to hold another summit in the short term. You will understand why the Portuguese Presidency is delighted at this event and this initiative which we shared together. We thank everyone for their cooperation, commitment and effort which made this summit a success.</p>

    <intervention id="2-294" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to quickly reply to the main points made, and then I intend to briefly discuss the economic partnership agreements (EPAs).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two Members spoke of their regret at the inadequate involvement of the European Parliament. I must say that perhaps we can do things better, but to be honest, with regard to other major international meetings in the past, I have the feeling that today, in any case, Parliament is fully involved in this process. What is more, as far as I am concerned, I always take great pleasure in debating with the Members and even contradicting them, since this helps hone my own postures. I regularly change my opinions because of you, not to keep you happy, but simply because you persuade me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point is Darfur and Sudan. First of all I wish to say, like the President, that the priority of this summit was not to find a solution to this issue. We did, however, arrange a troika meeting with the Portuguese Presidency, President Barroso, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and myself. We met with the Sudanese President, and I can tell you that the tone and content of the message conveyed during that meeting more than amply reflected the tough words I have heard here. We told Mr Bachir quite clearly that he had to respond in a positive manner as soon as possible to the UN to allow rapid deployment of the hybrid force that is obviously necessary to improve the situation of the people in Darfur ever so slightly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Cornillet, I must tell you that I fully agree with your speech on international humanitarian law. As you know, yesterday, for instance, I had a meeting with all the ECHO partner operators. There was a great number of them, and I discussed this problem of international humanitarian law. I took up the proposal you had mentioned to me, and we have made arrangements to organise a major conference in April or May on this matter. I also told them, even though I have no power to invite, that I would invite the European Parliament and national parliaments to attend this conference, if this is possible and if Parliament is interested in such a proposition, because it is true that every day I observe the increasing banality with which respect for international humanitarian law is being treated, and this is extremely serious. To such a point, in fact, that while I was there, I talked to the person responsible for gaining access for humanitarian convoys. I said to him: ‘but you are not respecting international humanitarian law at all’, and he said: ‘but you must understand there is a war on’. It is obviously quite dramatic to hear that, because this attitude contradicts the very essence, the very origins of international humanitarian law. We will therefore move forward on this issue, believe me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the nuclear issue, Mrs Isler Béguin, I must say that this is a good question which does catch my attention. You should simply be aware that this was requested by our African partners, I think more likely due to a question of principles than as an actual issue. Otherwise, I do agree with your misgivings. They were first of all asked to talk about non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and they said: ‘all right, we can talk about that, but in that case there is no reason not to talk about civil nuclear applications’. Well, this is all part of the current climate. Like you, I regret it, but they did request it, and we can hardly refuse to talk to our partners about this. It was also very low-key, and nobody is talking about developing a nuclear sector in Africa. We agreed to discuss nuclear issues and we accepted that these are a subject to be debated between us, because it was made clear from the beginning that no subject was taboo. Therefore I feel we do have to be coherent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are two other issues I wish to comment on, and then I will finish up with the EPAs. I think it was Mrs Zimmer who said that there is particular interest in anything that can be used by major European investors. I will come back to this again with the EPAs, but I obviously do not agree with this argument. You can keep me here for another two weeks, day and night, and I will not accept this criticism. I will not accept it for a very simple reason. I have attended these negotiations for several months now, although I should say I do not negotiate, but I do attend the negotiations. At no time did it seem to me that the ultimate objective was to assist either the European economy or European businesses. Those who make these claims, I feel, are either mistaken or misinformed, or they do so in bad faith. I think they are misinformed, because one never acts in bad faith. I feel, however, that in relation to this issue the remarks are extremely unjustified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now I come to the economic partnership agreements. On the subject of the interim agreements, I wish to ask: what are their aims? Have they been devised in support of European businesses? Not at all: the objective is actually to provide protection for countries with average incomes which would otherwise, as you well know, fall into a system of generalised preferences. This is obviously much less advantageous than the system that they operate at present, which is the equivalent system for least-developed countries (LDCs), in other words, Everything But Arms. Therefore, if at the end of this year, despite all my goodwill, the countries concerned have no other agreement setting them on the same footing as they had until today, they will certainly lose markets, and I have already mentioned the example of the Côte d’Ivoire. This other agreement is the interim agreement. Who have we made these interim agreements with? In most cases, we have arranged them with countries with average incomes which would otherwise find themselves operating a much more unfavourable system than they had to date. Has this been done to protect our businesses, to open up channels for our companies to move into Africa or invade Africa? No, that is not true.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What, then, have we proposed? I am now coming to the heart of the agreements, because the truth should be heard. I am willing to listen to everyone, I am willing to understand everyone, and I am even willing to agree with certain remarks and criticisms from the House. Well then, what have we proposed? We have proposed transitional periods of between 15 and 25 years. Mr Wade claims his market will be flooded with subsidised European agricultural products. This is precisely my point. Agricultural products can offer him protection from the 20% that is not liberalised. I do not understand exactly what he means. What is more, Mr Wade is not directly affected. It is true that he is entitled to speak on behalf of all of Africa, but he is not affected because he is an LDC and he has the ‘Everything But Arms’ system. Mr Mbeki, who I admire very much and get on with very well indeed, likes to denounce the EPAs, but this is easy to do. He has a special association treaty with us. This means we can ask ourselves to what extent he is unconcerned about bringing in all the other countries in that region as his competitors. I do not speak in bad faith; all I am saying is that we could ask him that question. I do not think this is the case, but we could ask him.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for Mr Konaré, the Chairman of the African Union Commission, he is a brilliant lawyer, and it is his vocation to gather up the concerns he hears from those around him. All this is legitimate. However, Mr Hutchinson, when you tell me ‘all the African leaders said …’, that is not true. It is not true of all the African leaders. It is true that a number of them did ask us some questions. For example: ‘what will happen, Mr Michel, when the tariff barriers are removed? We will obviously lose money and our ways and means budget. How will we pay our teachers, policemen, civil servants etc?’, and we said: ‘you can set up regional funds, and we will draw up what we call contribution agreements, which means provision of financial resources at least matching the net fiscal impact of removing the tariff barriers in order to offset the losses, and this will give you the means to finance state services etc.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is an asymmetric system, a transitional period. What else did we do? We drew up generic matrices with these countries, at their request, for it was they who provided the content for the agreements. What is this bureaucratic term? Generic matrices are a kind of plan containing all the projects, all the sectors, indeed the very nature of what they want to see as accompanying measures to go hand in hand with the gradual opening up of markets if they so wish: technology transfer, increased capacities, increased expertise, work on infrastructures, interconnection or improved access, all those aspects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also drew up a financing memorandum by regional economic community. This is a kind of undertaking, on paper and with figures, of the resources to be made available to them by the EU. There is only one thing I cannot do, and that is to promise them the money promised by the Member States at Gleneagles. They promised one billion euros, and at least half of this was for Africa. I hope they will come through on this. This money will be provided from 2010 and is intended as aid for trade. It is therefore extra money. We have doubled the regional funds I mentioned before. This is all on the table.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must confess my great concern is ‘economic integration’, because I feel that in relation to the ‘development’ aspect, it is initially ‘economic integration’ that will allow them to create wealth, wealth they can obviously use for social services and to redistribute prosperity among their people. It is true we have made very little progress on this aspect, for the reason I mentioned previously.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will therefore be discussing, probably all next year, this matter of regional EPAs to create, maintain and consolidate this dimension of economic integration. I therefore admit this, but this will only occur after having given everything … A positive response was forthcoming on everything they asked us for. This was true on the financial front, or in any case within the budgetary limitations, and also in relation to technical-legal issues, institutional and even political issues. What is also true is that, when we have to negotiate in 2008 in an attempt to secure this regional integration, we must be extremely convincing, and we must of course have arguments. Do not worry, they will be heard, and we will listen to them … I will certainly try to do my best to reply to their concerns, their uncertainties and their questions so that we can really specifically reassure them. I should tell you, however, that beyond this additional sum of one billion euros, half of which must be allocated to Africa, I do not have many more arguments. We will see what will emerge from this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am nevertheless a little hurt to hear we have been blackmailing our partners. There was never any blackmail of our partners for the very simple reason that we had no power to blackmail them. First and foremost, I would not have done this. We cannot just force our partners to sign agreements. Pardon me, but that is simplifying things too much. I can see the result. I even wish to inform you about the current status of countries that have signed up, to show you that there are many more countries than you think that have signed and have understood the mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The last item to round off concerns LDCs that now benefit from ‘Everything But Arms’ and thus have complete and unlimited access to our markets. In this case, I was asked what they stood to lose. They do not, in fact, lose anything at all, but gain the opportunity to benefit from particularly generous rules of origin. What are these particularly generous rules of origin? At the present time, for a product to be considered as originating in a partner state, the item must have undergone at least two transformations. Henceforth this will be a single transformation. For example, in the case of fish caught in their waters but imported here, this will be sufficient. That will count as one transformation, and so they may enter our markets quota-free and duty-free. This, then, is the big difference. There is considerable potential for opportunities of which they are currently being deprived.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wanted to tell you all this, and I am obviously willing to repeat the experience whenever you wish. Ask me questions, or send me questions in writing. I promise I will attempt to answer you sincerely and in full. If it appears that my answer to one of your questions is not good enough or is wrong, I will gladly admit this and I will rectify it, of that you may be sure. To date I have heard all the questions, I have checked all the questions, and I have involved myself considerably. I have not yet heard a question that did not receive a precise, specific and honest answer.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Although it is too early to determine the real impact of the decisions made at the EU-Africa Summit, and despite certain contradictions, the rejection of the EU’s free trade agreements (known as ‘economic partnership agreements’) by the African countries should be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Somewhat ironically, this rejection – despite all the EU’s unacceptable pressure and blackmail – of these ‘economic partnership agreements’ by the African countries constitutes a real example of what is, ultimately, the infamous ‘good governance’ so extolled by the EU. In other words, it represents the assumption and defence by a country of control over its economy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">However, in the energy trade, the distinction between production and services is not always clear.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the run-up to the inclusion of energy policy as a competence of the European Union in the new Treaty, what measures will the Commission take to tailor WTO rules to energy investments and energy services as well?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as the honourable Member has observed, within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) the provisions of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, apply to trade in energy products, and the provisions of GATS, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, apply to trade in energy services, including direct investments in such services. There is not yet an agreement that extends to direct investments in energy-related activities carried out on the investor’s own account in the secondary sector, such as mining, refining, energy generation and energy distribution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under Article 133 of the EC Treaty, which regulates the common commercial policy, the European Community is explicitly given exclusive power to legislate and to negotiate agreements on trade in energy products and to negotiate agreements on trade in energy services. In addition, the Commission is empowered to negotiate on behalf of both the Community and its Member States on the liberalisation of direct investments outside the service sector in the framework of talks with non-EU countries concerning free trade agreements. This means that the Commission can already address core issues relating to trade and investment in the energy sector and represent European interests in these matters in bilateral and multilateral WTO negotiations, and indeed that is precisely what the Commission does.</p>
      <p sl="de">The energy policy that will be mapped out in the new Treaty will focus on matters such as the security of the Union’s energy supply and the promotion of interconnections between energy networks, and in this respect it supplements but does not replace the common commercial policy in the energy sector.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, whenever there are discussions in my constituency about trade in energy sources, energy policy, the European Commission and the new Treaty, and especially about the WTO, time and again my constituents voice the fear that we shall have no option but to import nuclear energy and that we may even have to build nuclear power stations if present trends continue.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in some cases I find it hard to see the connection between the supplementary and the original question, but if you take a liberal approach to these things, I shall also be liberal with my answers.</p>
      <p sl="de">In answer to the first question, I share Mr van Nistelrooij’s view that the sale of products containing substandard technology in terms of energy efficiency and CO2 emissions is certainly not in our interests. Commissioner Dimas and I are working at the present time on proposals for ways to achieve a low-CO2 economy in Europe as regards both industrial policy and production and consumption practice. I hope that this work will culminate in standards which can then be fed into international negotiations too.</p>
      <p sl="de">You know what the current situation is. There is no scope for us at the present time to negotiate on such additional standards in the WTO framework and to secure their introduction. However, it is our aim in the medium and long term, as you know, to make high environmental and social standards binding by means of multilateral agreements in order to avoid the competitive disadvantage that our companies would otherwise suffer.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also wish to point out that we have a particularly keen interest in the successful pursuit of such a multilateral policy because we believe that the golden opportunity for European companies lies in our ability to become market leaders in the realm of environmentally friendly, energy-efficient and energy-saving products.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as Mr Rübig’s question is concerned, I must confess that I do not know the answer. As this subject is not within my portfolio, Mr Rübig, I shall ask Commissioner Mandelson to provide you with a written answer right away. I certainly have no wish to say anything misleading at this point. I know that this matter features in the context of the free trade agreements we are currently negotiating, such as the one with South Africa, but in which category it is actually being discussed is beyond my ken. You will have full information tomorrow at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as nuclear power stations are concerned, the European Commission has a perfectly clear policy, which is the policy of the European Union as a whole. Each Member State is entirely independent and free in its choice of energy mix. No recommendation can be made and no instruction given to any Member State to use or not to use nuclear energy, nor does the Commission try to exert any influence. We are completely neutral on that issue and shall remain so. There will be no recommendations whatsoever of the kind you fear.</p>
      <p sl="de">You are surely aware, however, that the Euratom Treaty has been integrated into the EC Treaty, which means that promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy is certainly one of the tasks of the European Union. That is done through research support, for which nuclear-energy projects are fully eligible and have been receiving funding for several decades, so it is nothing new, and it is done through the European Investment Bank, which has helped to finance nuclear power stations in certain cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">In other words, there is no EU policy for the generalised use of nuclear power, nor is there any EU policy for the generalised abandonment of nuclear power.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 35 by Justas Vincas Paleckis (H-0879/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Sustainable urban development model</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Towns and cities in the EU Member States, particularly in those countries that joined the Union in the 21st century, are growing at a fast pace and often without any clear vision. Residential areas are moving away from the centre, giving rise to problems relating to transport, the distribution of resources and the development of utilities networks. Urban development is therefore having a negative impact on the environment, and energy consumption is on the increase.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In 1990, the Commission’s green paper on the urban environment recommended the compact city as an environmentally sound development model. Recently, there has been a growing tendency towards the multi-centre urban development model. What are the EU’s recommendations concerning sustainable, environmentally sound urban development? What arguments exist in support of each of the development models, and on what data are the recommendations based?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-307" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission strongly supports the promotion of sustainable urban development which fully respects the environment. The Commission adopted its thematic strategy on the urban environment in 2006. The strategy recognises the whole of sustainable urban development in relation to the quality of life, but the strategy also recognises the diversity that exists between citizens in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, and following extensive consultations with local authorities and the Member States, the strategy, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, assumed that local and national authorities are best placed to find and implement solutions most appropriate to the local circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against the background of the diversity of urban situations, the Commission does not recommend a specific model of development valid for each city in Europe. The Commission considers it essential to put in place the appropriate governance and planning tools, but is of the opinion that there is no real added value in imposing an obligation to establish specific plans, such as environmental management plans and sustainable urban transport plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has, however, published guidance on sustainable urban transport plans and on integrated environment management plans, with the aim of assisting local authorities to implement the strategy’s objectives. Guidance should be seen as a description of the process, and a reminder of the key elements that could be considered when developing integrated environmental management programmes and sustainable urban transport plans at local level. Both documents are based upon comprehensive consultations and examples of best practice developed by cities themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legislation affecting urban areas exists already, for example in the field of air quality, water management, noise and waste. That legislation needs to be implemented better. A noticeable and significant improvement in the living conditions in urban areas will be seen through the full implementation of existing legislative instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission recalls the wealth of ideas on urban development which has allowed the ministers responsible for urban affairs to reach a consensus based on the Lille Action Programme, the Rotterdam Urban Acquis, the Bristol Accord and, more recently, the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities adopted at an informal Council meeting on 25 May 2007. In September 2007 it approved a Green Paper on urban mobility, which has now been submitted for public consultation. Those documents constitute a shared background, outlining the main conditions necessary to achieve urban sustainable development. Furthermore, the Commission actively encourages dialogue and the dissemination of best practices between cities within the framework of programmes financed by the European Regional Development Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the data available on the situation of European cities, which can provide the basis for policy decisions, the Commission has put in place the Urban Audit, which contains data on the situation of European cities, and is now being updated. The Commission has recently published a study on the state of European cities, which further analyses the results of the Urban Audit.</p>

      <p sl="en">If you allow me, Madam President, I would like to start with the second question, and I shall read again what I have said and make a short comment on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against the background of the diversity of urban situations, the Commission does not recommend a specific model of development valid for each city in Europe. This is clearly respecting the subsidiarity principle and the principle of diversity and, in other words, in my own words, it means one size does not fit all. It is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is an approach that takes into account the specificities, the specific needs and interests and capacities of the cities, but everything I think we need – guidance, recommendations and exchange of best practices – is there.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the first question is concerned, I would be tempted to give an answer based on my own experience and I could certainly tell you the city in which I would prefer to live, but that is not a political issue. The Commission does not have a scoreboard of that type and does not have a ranking of European cities that would totally combine all the elements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, I am really not in a position to give you an answer on an objective basis and it would be very unwise to give the answer on a personal basis to the detriment of all the others.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 36 by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (H-0933/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Net neutrality in the telecom reform package</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Over the past five years we have witnessed a very lively debate in the USA on net neutrality, including the question of the extent to which network operators can limit and control user traffic on the internet. The telecom reform package addresses this issue, and seeks to resolve it by demanding greater transparency for users about what they are purchasing. But, as we have seen with the intervention on roaming charges, transparency is not always enough to protect the consumer. Unrestricted access to the Internet encourages innovation (as with Skype, Joost, web 2.0 etc.). However, when telecoms companies have the right to prioritise and even maybe block user traffic on the Internet, does the Commission consider that the telecom reform package does enough to protect consumers and promote innovation on the Internet? And what would be the optimum solution?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-312" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The question raised by the honourable Member is very important for consumers, telecom service providers and content providers, and of course also for telecom regulators. It concerns a balance between network providers’ desire to offer differential qualities of service for internet services, in order to optimise the use of its network resources, and the freedom of users to distribute or access any legal on-line content without interference such as blocking or degrading.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is committed to keeping the internet open both for service providers wanting to deliver new, innovative services and for consumers wanting to access the services they choose and to create and upload contents themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ongoing debate in the United States on net neutrality is strongly influenced by the lack of regulation in the US to ensure that access is kept open, and, combined with the concentration of network ownership, the lack of access regulation has provoked real concerns among consumers and content providers that there could be foreclosure of the internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in Europe is that we are generally in a good position with regard to net neutrality and net freedoms, because we have effective network regulation in line with EU telecom rules, and European consumers have a greater choice of broadband services providers. The fact that consumers have more choice and there is more competition means that, if one supplier seeks to restrict user rights, then another can enter the market with a more open offer. The current EU regulatory framework has so far ensured that the telecom market remains open, that offers made to consumers are transparent and that competition is effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand the honourable Member’s question, because there is a risk that in the future a prioritisation of traffic may increasingly be introduced. In the past, all information, packets and bits of data were treated equally. But today new techniques can differentiate between packets, in order to award priority to high urgency communications or to users who have paid a premium for higher-quality services.</p>
      <p sl="en">These techniques are legitimate in cases where service levels have to be guaranteed in order for the service to be effective. Voice-over internet services, for example, need a basic minimum level of connection in order to be satisfactory, especially for emergency or business calls. In addition, prioritisation creates an incentive mechanism for network operators to invest in upgrading bandwidth as demand increases. That is the nice part of the story. The problem is that the same techniques could be utilised to degrade the quality of service to unacceptably low levels. Such discrimination might then lead to sub-standard services for consumers and alternative providers.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why, in the telecom reform package, which was adopted by the Commission on 13 November 2007 and presented to Parliament that same day, we proposed to give national telecom regulators the power to set minimum quality levels for network transmission services based on technical standards identified at EU level. In addition, there is now a new requirement in the telecom rules to indicate to users in advance any techniques that have been implemented and which could lead to prioritisation. That is what we call the transparency rule.</p>
      <p sl="en">We as a Commission believe that this approach strikes a balance that will safeguard competition and user access, without unduly restricting the ability of network providers to experiment with different business models.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to this, Parliament knows that the Commission is closely monitoring developments as regards net freedoms. Following the 2006 World Summit on the Information Society, we presented to Parliament a communication which clearly stated the Commission’s intention to monitor and safeguard the neutrality of the internet. The architectural principles of an open internet and end-to-end connectivity are also explicitly mentioned in the Council conclusions from 2005.</p>
      <p sl="en">These issues are under constant analysis, are constantly monitored and are discussed regularly with Member States, for instance in the i2010 High Level Group, and with third countries. This is important, because the internet does not have borders. The Commission will promote continuously the need for an open internet and for non-discriminatory access. This is what underpins the philosophy of the regulatory approach under the EU telecom rules, which will be further enhanced by our reform project, to be discussed in Parliament in the coming months.</p>

On the other hand, mobile TV is now reaching more and more people. How do you assess the developments in this field?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-316" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Firstly I would like to thank the honourable Member for helping me move ahead in this policy. It is a policy based on an open network and an open internet, which has always been, and will continue to be, the mindset, approach and target value of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not be too worried for the time being, because our regulatory framework fortunately means that we are not in the same difficult conditions as other parts of the world. That does not mean we should sit back and do nothing, which is why I said we are going to monitor this matter very closely. I will report back to Parliament, and I am sure that in the course of our discussions on the reform package on the telecom regulatory rules we will return to these issues. I also foresee technological advances making things change very rapidly, perhaps meaning that I will not need to come back in the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning open access to new technology and new investments in broadband, the honourable Member knows perfectly well that the Commission has vetoed the proposal by the German Government to establish a new monopoly on fibre. We do not think that monopolies are the answer to open internet access and everything we believe in. That is also the reason we are going for competition, which we see as a means of opening up possibilities for investment. Those Member States with most competition in terms of open markets are also those Member States which have most competition in terms of infrastructure. Competition in infrastructure means the availability of service content for the consumer, and consumer choice. That is exactly what we want to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say the following to Mr Rübig: it is well known that I have been campaigning very vigorously for a European standard, which would enable us to make mobile TV a success story throughout Europe within the shortest possible time, just as we did with our GSM standard. I am thinking here primarily of things like content, for these smaller formats will need specific kinds of content, which will present our creative industry with a very great opportunity if we manage to have mobile television on the market as soon as possible, by which I mean before next year’s big football tournament and the Olympic Games. This is an opportunity that we Europeans should not miss.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: European Charter for Small Enterprises</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Charter for Small Enterprises has the potential to play a central role in improving the business environment for small enterprises in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">During its seven years of existence, the European Charter for Small Enterprises has become a core document for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) policy in Europe. Starting with the 15 Member States in 2000, 44 countries have now adopted it as a reference frame and it is also used today at regional level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 2005, SME policy has become a key element within the renewed Lisbon Partnership for Growth and Jobs, and the Charter was integrated within the Lisbon reporting process. This ensures the necessary priority attention at political level. This is complemented by the yearly good practice exercise and the Charter conferences, which provide the necessary focus on implementation. Both the good practice exercise and the yearly Charter conference continue to be very successful.</p>
      <p sl="en">The good practice exercise has, up to now, provided more than 250 examples of proven and successful SME policy measures. In around 80 of these cases, Member States indicated that they have been inspired by measures from other Member States in the development of their own policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall give you a few examples, although I could give you a long list. The Greek system of one-stop-shop services was inspired by Ireland and its presentation at the Dublin Charter Conference in 2004. The Austrian tax exemption for invested profits was developed on the basis of a similar measure in Italy. Denmark provides support for SMEs in the use of e-business on the basis of similar initiatives in Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Norway. In all these cases, Member States have confirmed that the Charter triggered the inspiration.</p>
      <p sl="en">The high interest in the Charter is also demonstrated by the constantly increasing number of participants at the annual Charter conferences. This year’s Charter conference in Berlin attracted 350 participants, the highest number of participants ever, and I was very happy that I was able to be there and to address those people from more than 40 countries. The next Charter conference will take place from 3 to 4 June 2008 in Bled, Slovenia. It will be co-organised by the Slovenian Presidency, and I expect an even higher number of participants.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission sees that the Charter is highly useful in encouraging the Member States to improve the business environment for small enterprises all over Europe. In its seventh year it continues to be a crucial policy instrument. So the natural answer to your question is ‘yes’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive answer. Where I am coming from really – and I know it is not in your area – is in relation to the whole development of internet services and broadband services. Across Europe there is a 19% take-up. In my own country, there is something like a 16% take-up, and it affects small enterprises in rural areas, particularly where I come from. For instance, I fly out to Parliament from the westernmost airport in the EU, which is in Tralee.</p>
      <p sl="en">My point basically is that the voluntary organisations of small enterprises who give support to small enterprises have been very good at giving information and I am just wondering whether we can do more with them, helping them to make information available to their members.</p>

Secondly, linking this issue to the Lisbon Agenda, would you agree with me that one of the biggest issues is how to help small businesses grow quickly, particularly those small enterprises which have good ideas but find it difficult to get capital, accelerate their growth and create new jobs? Is there, within the Charter programme, an opportunity for a ‘mini-charter’ for high-growth businesses?</p>

      <p sl="en">On the first question, I would like to confirm that all the SME organisations are indeed fully involved, and that we have finalised a project that will create a network for small business support everywhere in the European Union. One of the most important elements of that network will be precisely the ICT uptake in a broader sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have clearly identified one of the reasons for European SMEs being less dynamic, for instance, than American SMEs, which is that American SMEs grow faster, are more profitable, are more innovative and on average employ more people. One of the causes of this – and we have analysed this clearly – is that ICT uptake is much much better in the United States. In particular, they use the most modern technology available. In Europe we are happy if the owner of a small family business is on-line at all! That is a matter of fact. The reality of the European enterprise is that it is a very small micro-business with less than 10 people. It is not normally growth-oriented, but is a business that exists to guarantee the income of a family. That is why it is there. It is therefore difficult to convince such enterprises that they have to modernise, that they have to be market players and that they have to grow.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully share your views and can only say that we have many, many initiatives already in place to support these enterprises – some of them, by the way, together with the relevant industries, which of course have an interest in selling their products. We therefore combine the two, and the initiatives are not aimed solely at SMEs. The problem of ICT uptake for SMEs has to be seen in combination with the problem in rural areas of the network and the infrastructure not existing. The Commission is working on this important area too. This is certainly also part of the Charter process, and will be part of the reporting system.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the second question, from Mr Harbour, he knows that I am always pleased to answer his questions but, as far as the Small Business Act is concerned, this one comes a little bit early. The Charter is a process, as you know, and it would be wise to concentrate on what it is now – a network of cooperation in the area of new ideas and best practices. I am hesitant to create too many instruments, but it is obvious that in the process of preparing the Small Business Act we have to examine all the existing ones, whether they are appropriate or not, and decide whether we can improve them or not in the context.</p>
      <p sl="en">In principle, I must say that I am very happy that everywhere in Europe it is now accepted that SMEs really have the strongest potential for innovation, growth and job creation. All the initiatives which we are preparing will help SMEs to fully use that potential and to unlock it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have known what the basic problems are for a couple of years, and you will be well aware of what these are: the problem of insufficiently strong innovative capacity; the problem of not having access to financial instruments, especially venture capital; the problem of the transfer of the business – a very important aspect which is highly underestimated in some Member States. We are losing hundreds of thousands of enterprises every year in Europe which could easily continue to exist if the transfer from one generation to the next could be organised in a better way. That is a highly important question. The whole tax environment for SMEs is an important one, and my favourite issue of course – over-regulation – is much more important for SMEs than for big companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Big companies can live with very heavy and difficult regulation. They have legal departments and they do it. By the way, I am also convinced that big companies do not need the internal market as much as smaller companies do. Bigger companies would use the right of establishment and would be everywhere. The whole internal market philosophy, in my view, must be focused on the SMEs, and unfortunately I have to tell you that only 8% of European enterprises do cross-border business.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you analyse that, you find that the potential of the European internal market is greatly under-exploited, if only 8% of our enterprises – normally the bigger enterprises – participate. So we have a lot of work still to do.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Noise pollution from motor vehicles</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Could the Commission outline the legislation and guidelines currently in place to deal with noise pollution from motor vehicles, in particular the defined dBA, if any, and state whether it will be making further efforts to ensure that noise pollution from motor vehicles is curbed?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-325" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The issue of noise emissions of four-wheeled motor vehicles – cars, vans, trucks and buses – is addressed by UNECE Regulation No 51 and equivalent Directive 70/157/EEC introducing noise tests and limit values.</p>
      <p sl="en">The limit values have been reduced several times in the past, most recently in 1995. The maximum allowed sound level lies today between 74 dBA for passenger cars and 80 dBA for heavy trucks. A further allowance is given to direct-injection diesel engines, off-road vehicles and sports cars.</p>
      <p sl="en">This latest reduction did not have the expected effect and subsequent studies showed that the measurement method does not reflect real-world driving behaviour any more.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was therefore decided that, before reducing the limits once again, it was first of all necessary to develop a new test cycle and bring the driving conditions for the noise test closer in line with real-life driving operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The work on a new test cycle is now finalised. It will replace the existing test protocol with a better measurement method reproducing the sound levels generated by heavy vehicles during normal driving in urban traffic.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the new test procedure, it is foreseen that the existing additional allowances for certain vehicles or technologies will be abolished.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before this method can be used for type-approval purposes, new limit values for this method need to be established on the basis of an impact assessment. In order to obtain representative data to determine those values and establish a solid impact assessment, vehicle manufacturers are obliged to carry out the old and the new measurement methods in parallel during a period of two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The old method will continue to be required, in order to receive type approval, and the new method will be used for monitoring purposes until 2009. As soon as the collection of data is finished, the Commission will propose new legislation setting revised limit values.</p>
      <p sl="en">A new test method for motorbikes is also close to being finalised. The discussions in the UNECE are now focusing on additional roadside tests that would be carried out during type approval in order to provide noise values that would allow comparison with those measured at roadside checks in order to detect motorbikes that have been tampered with or that are insufficiently maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is expected that the work can be finalised in 2008. The Commission will then propose to adhere to the relevant UNECE regulation with revised limit values.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the Commission has recently carried out a consultation exercise on a package of measures on tyres, including the reduction of the existing noise limit for tyres. The consultation proposes reduction of around 4 dBA for passenger car tyres and 6 dBA for commercial vehicle tyres: it is quite considerable. The new limits would be expected to come into force for new tyre types around 2012.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive reply. I certainly welcome your indication that there is a new test site now available and that new limit values will be set.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am coming at this from an Irish perspective. In the last few years we have had the phenomenon of what we know as ‘boy racers’, who modify old cars, take to the roads at all hours of the day and night and cause a major problem in relation to sound emissions which sound like a jet plane, causing major disturbance, particularly in urban areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that there are two regulations, as you mentioned, Commissioner: UNECE Regulation No 51 and Directive 70/157/EEC. But the problem as I see it, in relation to UNECE Regulation No 51, is that it applies only to new cars. I think there should be a specification, at least in relation to the reply received from Commissioner Dimas: there should be a regulation that there should be no modification of a car and that there should be regular tests.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, in the case of road vehicles, noise emissions may not exceed defined ceilings. In the case of rail transport, the ceiling is based on average noise levels, which means that extremely high noise levels have to be endured in the vicinity of railway lines simply because the average noise level does not exceed the permitted limit. Does the Commission intend to adopt similar measures to those that apply to motor vehicles so as to provide relief in future for those who live next to noisy stretches of railway line?</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to point out that we keep referring to specific requirements a lot, but the issue of their implementation is not being covered sufficiently. Speaking of pollution, I would like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to the fact that the mechanism for monitoring all the requirements we have just discussed happens to be very fragmented. In my opinion the Commission should put forward a proposal (perhaps they are in the process of preparing one) with a view to harmonising the procedure for administering pollution criteria and assessing pollution, as it is a key problem for small countries such as Lithuania whose management bodies are weak and do not have the means to implement all the requirements.</p>

    <intervention id="2-329" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the first question, there is no doubt whatsoever that modifications to vehicles which result in noise emissions above the permitted level are prohibited. Such modifications may even be a criminal offence. It goes without saying, however, that it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure, through their normal traffic surveillance, that such traffic offenders – for that is precisely what they are – are caught. I do not see the remotest prospect that we at the European level can do anything to make the Member States take more action to curb practices which are unequivocally illegal.</p>
      <p sl="de">Car racing on the public highway is, of course, illegal in every European country. There is no European legislation that anyone could cite in answer to a charge of racing on the public highway. This matter therefore lies entirely within the competence of the Member States, which have all the instruments they need to prevent such offences.</p>
      <p sl="de">As for noise emissions from rail transport, my direct responsibility is limited to active noise prevention, in other words what can be done to cars to limit the noise they emit. I am not directly responsible for the passive noise prevention to which you have referred here. I am more than willing, however, to discuss the matter with the competent Commissioner and to ensure that you get an answer as quickly as possible to the question as to whether the Commission has any plans in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do, in fact, share your views entirely. This is a very important issue. Noise prevention efforts cannot be focused on road traffic alone. Modern railway technology can pose particularly serious noise problems. I know from Germany that noise pollution is a very significant factor in the modern technology that powers the Transrapid monorail system. We shall therefore look into this matter, and you will receive a definite answer.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third question referred to control mechanisms. On this matter, I can only say that our legislation is unambiguous. The rules are clear, the limits are clear, and responsibility for ensuring that the limits are observed lies with the Member States. The Commission does not possess control instruments with which it can check in every single case whether European legislation is actually being applied in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The subsidiarity principle is a fact of life. I cannot identify where we would have to amend European legislation in order to ensure that it was properly applied everywhere. The rules are the same for all Member States. They have clear instructions stipulating how these should be applied. In this case, which concerns Lithuania, I can only say that our counterparts in the parliament and government of that country are responsible for ensuring that such problems do not arise.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Liberalisation of the energy market for the benefit of consumers</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The conclusions of a recent report commissioned by the European Commission on the consequences for consumers of the deregulation of the European market in gas and electricity, as well as the very significant price rises recently recorded or announced, show that many Member States were not yet ready to meet the challenge of liberalising this market.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This being the case, can the Commission say how it intends to react to the considerable rises in energy prices which are hitting the consumers who should actually have been the main beneficiaries of the liberalisation? Can it say whether, and how, consumers will be consulted, and involved in the bodies set up by the Commission and the European and national regulators with a view to remedying the current problems and difficulties?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-331" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission is following closely the recent developments in prices in Member States. It considers that those increases cannot be easily explained by one single factor, but need to be seen in the broader context of rising world demand for oil and gas. However, increasing investment activity – and in particular the switch to more sustainable energy production – definitely plays a part too. Moreover, the point of departure for market opening was, in several Member States, very low prices. In the medium and long term, this failed to give the necessary signals for much-needed investment, and we are now paying the price.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to the question of whether such price increases can also be attributed to the exercise of market power, the Commission has studied this issue and it came to the conclusion that electricity prices in certain Member States were higher than one would expect in fully competitive markets. In this respect, the Commission, the Council and the competition authorities armed regulators to identify anti-competitive behaviour and to take the appropriate action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also itself investigating alleged anti-competitive behaviour by certain operators, and has launched five anti-trust proceedings in the course of this year. The Commission is very much aware of the structural problems in the sector too. Therefore, the third energy package makes wide-ranging proposals to remedy those structural problems, in particular by proposing ownership unbundling of the transmission system operators.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has always been of the opinion that consumers should be the main beneficiaries of liberalisation. The Commission’s proposals for the third energy package therefore contain a number of measures which will strengthen the role and rights of consumers. In particular, the package proposes to give consumers the right to switch supplier at any time and to have free access to their consumption data. By increasing consumer awareness and rights with respect to their energy consumption, the Commission is providing the tools for a functioning retail market.</p>

      <p sl="en">I will start with the third question.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are issues that could be dealt with by the market, by consumer power, but there are issues where we need structural change. The particularity of the electricity market is that the marginal power plant decides the price level. Here, it is very clear that we need complete transparency in the market, which is why the third regulation package really addresses the separation of transmission activities from the supply activities. Otherwise we will never have a chance to ask whether we are paying a fair price.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, if you create the conditions for competition in the market, then the price trends are really that it is not increasing or coming down or it is increasing less compared with an uncompetitive market, because otherwise the companies which have a semi-monopoly could really dictate the price. That means that these two issues are actually in the hands of the governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">On consumer power, we have adopted a consumer rights charter and this definitely gives all the right information about the rights of consumers stemming from all existing legislation. We have strengthened these rights even more.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the consumer forum, we will certainly invite the consumer organisations that are well represented in Member States and the umbrella organisation. The best supporters of our measures to really create a Europe-wide competitive market definitely come from the different consumer organisations.</p>

This was among the main objectives in setting up an Energy Community, which is based on EU legislation, for the internal gas and electricity markets, and in particular its provisions on security of energy supply and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">South-east Europe is at the crossroads of several main energy routes. Several countries of the region produce gas. I would mention Croatia and Romania. New LNG terminals on the Adriatic coast and the new gas and electricity interconnectors linking to the different energy sources were recently put into service or are at an advanced phase of development.</p>

      <p sl="en">Moreover, new gas sources will allow the development of the gas sector in those countries where it does not exist yet. There is also a very clear focus on energy efficiency.

      <p sl="unknown">The security of Ireland’s energy supply is becoming increasingly important for consumers, businesses and policymakers; hence the need for full interconnection with the broader European energy market. To achieve this, the necessary infrastructure needs to be put in place to ensure a secure supply of safe and reasonably priced energy.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In Ireland, EIRGRID is currently in the consultation phase in relation to the Meath Cavan Power Project and the Cavan-Tyrone Interconnector, both of which are part-funded by EU TEN-E Initiative, with the EU likely to contribute to the construction phase.

Could the Commission make a statement in relation to this particular dimension of the problem?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In addition, given that the power lines run for up to 58 kilometres, there is a strong argument in favour of placing these lines underground.

      <p sl="en">The construction of overhead electrical power lines with a voltage of 220 kW or more and a length of more than 15 km has to undergo an environmental impact assessment. Furthermore, any plan or project for overhead electrical power lines that is likely to have a significant adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites is subject to the procedural safeguards set out in Article 6 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC.</p>

      <p sl="en">Can the Commissioner tell me if there is any definitive evidence or scientific proof in relation to whether or not electromagnetic fields are a hazard to public health? I know that the Member States, as he said, have the final competence in relation to their interconnectors and their cables etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, would the Commissioner not agree that, despite the fact there is resistance from industry, at the same time, from the point of view of visual intrusion, public health and the environment, it would preferable if such cables were underground?</p>

      <p sl="en">I will start my answer with undergrounding. Up until now, undergrounding cable technology has been used only in limited cases, like Madrid Airport.</p>
      <p sl="en">In principle there is now no limitation on the length of the cabling itself. The question is the cost. That cost would normally be around three to five times higher than overhead lines, and, to date, it has not been used for the very reason that you have two options. In fact, it has only been used when overhead lines are impossible.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some cases where municipalities are now considering the use of cables, which will be ground-breaking cases. However, it will mean more costs for the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning scientific evidence on exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, there is a general limitation, there are the Council recommendations that I mentioned dating from 12 July 1999, and there are minimum framework restrictions and reference levels. However, as concerns further scientific evidence on damage to health, I am not aware of a need to go beyond those safety recommendations originating in 1999.</p>
      <p sl="en">Basically, overhead lines are still a viable option and I believe that the choice between overhead lines or cables is one that should be made according to the situation, if one considers that cabling is not without its difficulties too. One needs to be aware that a Natura 2000 site may be involved or that there may be some impact on the environment. There is no solution that makes zero impact on the environment. At the same time, there are technology choices that could be proposed, and companies are aware of these.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Through NGOs civil society plays a very important role in meeting the needs of the process of European integration and new kinds of European governance. Which Community action programme is currently in force for supporting European NGOs active mainly in the environmental protection field? Which NGOs (and which of their activities) which contribute to the further development and implementation of the Community's environmental policy and legislation have so far received funding? What is the amount of funding received per NGO? Is the scope of the existing Community programme differentiated geographically? Which Greek NGOs have taken part - or are taking part - in the current programme, either independently or on a transnational basis?

      <p sl="en">Funding from the Commission to support the operation of European environmental NGOs is provided through a programme that has existed since 1997. The legal basis for the current programme is the LIFE+ Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective is to strengthen the participation of European NGOs in the development and implementation of EU environmental policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">A large number of diverse NGOs have been founded during the course of the programme. Lists of operations and amounts are published on the DG Environment website. Time does not permit me to read them all out, but the list will be forwarded to the honourable Member.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no geographic differentiation in the programme, since it is targeted towards European and not national organisations. To be eligible, the organisations should pursue activities in at least three EU Member States. But only one of the organisations consistently funded, the Mediterranean Information Office for Environment, Culture and Sustainable Development, is based in Greece. Many of them have Greek member organisations, for example, the European Environmental Bureau, EUROPARC and International Friends of Nature.</p>
      <p sl="en">Grants are awarded in a yearly call for proposals. Applications are assessed against award criteria and the NGOs that have the best potential to contribute to development and implementation of the EU environmental policy priorities are selected.</p>

If nothing else, I am one of those who believe that non-governmental organisations are a form of European governance, albeit an informal one; they play an extremely important role, and that role – this is the reason for my question – must be given greater prominence.

Recently, however, I have been wondering more and more often how democratically these organisations work and whether the Commission checks whether these NGOs are democratic organisations that hold internal elections or whether they are bodies with a command structure that is not open to scrutiny and is not accountable to the members of the organisation or to anyone else, which would mean that funds might, in certain circumstances, be channelled in directions that no one would suspect.</p>

We will provide answers in writing to all the questions you have asked, along with the list that I promised in my answer.

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 54 by Claude Moraes (H-0878/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Waste crime / protection of the environment through criminal law</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In February 2007 the European Commission proposed a directive (COD/2007/0022) that obliges Member States to treat serious offences against the environment as criminal acts and to set minimum sanctions for environmental crimes such as waste crime. This is a positive step - as the Environment Agency of the UK Government has pointed out, one major problem with fighting environmental crime is that fines are too low and thus do not offer sufficient incentives for compliance with environmental regulations.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">However, given the obstacles facing this directive before it becomes law in Member States, what other steps does the Commission envisage in order to combat waste crime across Europe?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-351" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Ensuring that Member States correctly apply EU waste legislation and preventing illegal waste activities are among the Commission’s top priorities. The proposed environmental crime directive will ensure that serious environmental offences are subject to effective criminal sanctions throughout the European Union. All serious waste-related crimes, including the illegal treatment, transport, export and import of waste, are covered by the proposed directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">The environmental crime initiative is, however, far from being the only action taken by the Commission in order to prevent waste crime. The Commission is taking a number of specific actions in areas where waste crime is a serious problem for Member States. This concerns, in particular, illegal landfills and illegal waste shipments, which are covered by important EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission takes early action in order to prevent negative environmental and health impacts as a result of waste activities. Awareness events concerning landfills and waste shipments are organised where the risk is high. Last year, 16 such events took place and, this year, another 10 events are planned. Multilateral meetings are also regularly held with national authorities and stakeholders to tackle bad implementation of EU waste legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Guidelines are continuously developed regarding key EU waste legislation, such as on waste shipments and targeting particular problematic waste schemes, for example, waste electrical and electronic equipment and light vehicles. Focus on such guidelines will ensure that EU legislation is uniformly and correctly applied throughout the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is of paramount importance to know what is going on in the Member States and to verify compliance on the ground. The Commission closely cooperates with the IMPEL network regarding, for example, joint enforcement actions on waste shipments and inspections and monitoring of landfills.</p>
      <p sl="en">Systematic failures by Member States to respect EU waste legislation are continuously met by legal action from the Commission, including the powerful threat of fines under the EC Treaty. For example, in 2003 Greece was fined EUR 20 000 a day for tolerating an illegal landfill on the island of Crete. Currently, a large number of illegal landfills in many Member States are being tackled by serious infringement actions launched by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also encouraging Member States to make use of funding opportunities at EU level and to ensure that the waste programme expenditure under the various instruments contributes to the improved implementation of waste legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU waste shipment regulation contains the basis for cooperation between Member States to prevent illegal waste shipment. We are currently examining the need for further actions in order to strengthen the enforcement of EU waste legislation, including legally binding rules for inspections of waste shipments. Specific criteria could possibly be defined in order to ensure sufficient quality and frequency of inspections.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you, Commissioner, for that comprehensive answer.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recently consulted with the Environment Agency in the United Kingdom on this directive. While we all welcome the prioritisation of the Commission in this area, what I was hearing from the Environment Agency in my own Member State was concern that the penalties and possible fines in Member States will be pitched far too low for there to be any real incentive to obey rules where enforcement action would not actually occur. This would result in massive fly-tipping and dumping of illegal waste.</p>

      <p sl="en">As for fines imposed on the Member States, I would mention that, for Greece, the fine is per day, and per year it is quite substantial. In my opinion, in the case of Member States’ failure to enforce legislation, we should follow the legal infringement procedures that we follow, and it is the Court which decides on the fine.</p>
      <p sl="en">For companies, the fines are also imposed according to national legislation if this is violated. So it is up to the Member States to really strengthen these fines, because, from the Commission point of view, we do what is required and we cannot prescribe the fines for not implementing vigorously enough EU legislation. It should be addressed through the Court, because that is the legal structure of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">If there is a need to strengthen the system of fines, we will definitely follow this advice very carefully, because, basically, fines should be imposed in a way that prevents violation of the law, not just so that companies can shrug them off or pass the cost on to consumers. But, in this area, I believe that everybody shares the same objective, so I believe that the level of fines imposed today is not an issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue is that legislation is not implemented vigorously enough and inspections are not particularly frequent, and that requires that the Commission should take additional steps to guide the Member States to take stronger action on waste crimes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that the enforcement of legal provisions is at least as important as their enactment. We have a case that you have not mentioned yet. That is the situation in which the disposal of certain waste is made a criminal offence in one country, and the waste in question is then shipped to another country. In such a case, in fact, two Member States are probably committing infringements of the Treaty. Has consideration been given to this eventuality too?</p>

      <p sl="en">We have legislation on waste shipment, so this means there is common ground, and there is additional cooperation on penal matters, because the issue goes beyond waste issues. There have been developments, and current legislative processes allow companies that illegally ship waste to be penalised. I do not think we have difficulties owing to a lack of appropriate legislation, but rather because that legislation is not implemented.</p>

      <p sl="en">The verification of compliance with the requirements of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste-water treatment is a complex task as it implies the evaluation of data concerning thousands of agglomerations all over the European Union. The Commission’s services collect and assess all information available and focus on the data included in the national implementation reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">When their assessment shows that Member States are not complying with their obligations under the directive, the Commission initiates infringement procedures in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the thousands of agglomerations which have to be checked, the Commission has privileged a horizontal approach. Thus, instead of randomly starting individual infringement procedures for each agglomeration, the Commission has initiated global cases addressing the situation per Member State and per core obligation. Greece is one of the Member States which still face significant problems in properly implementing the directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards agglomerations of more than 10 000 inhabitants, Greece has designated 36 sensitive areas. Out of the 18 agglomerations discharging into those areas, 14 comply with the requirements of the directive. However, the Commission considers that 10 other water bodies should have been designated as sensitive areas. There is an ongoing infringement procedure at this stage of a reasoned opinion. The Greek authorities contest the need for the designation of those areas as sensitive. The assessment of the information sent is ongoing and, if necessary, the Commission will not hesitate to bring the case before the Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the specific question of the agglomeration of Thriasio Pedio, in its judgment of 24 June 2004, the Court of Justice declared that Greece had failed to install a collecting system and to provide for appropriate treatment. The Commission has therefore initiated an infringement procedure in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Greek authorities have approved the construction of infrastructure required, which is co-funded by the Cohesion Fund. According to the information available, the project is planned to be operational by the end of 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards agglomerations of more than 15 000 inhabitants or their equivalent, out of the 75 agglomerations, 52 meet the standards laid down by the directive as regards collection systems for urban waste water and secondary treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the agglomerations that are not in compliance, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure. In its judgment of 25 October 2007, the Court ruled that 23 agglomerations still did not comply with the requirements of the directive. The Commission has requested information from the Greek authorities on the measures they plan to take in order to comply with the judgment.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the point raised on the reduction of the size of agglomerations, the Commission verifies the information available and addresses any inconsistency in the framework of the ongoing infringement procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should be stressed that, in order to comply, Greece uses the European Community funding available. As far as the Cohesion Fund is concerned, in Greece 41 projects are currently open. The absorption rate is 49%. Very often, such projects are combined projects which, apart from waste-water- and rainwater-related infrastructure, may also include water supply infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ERDF Operational Programme ‘Environment’ co-finances nine waste water projects. These projects relate to the construction and/or modernisation of waste-water treatment plants and sewage networks. The absorption rate is 19%.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards asserting regional operational programmes of the ERDF, the question of absorption rates for the waste-water sector should be addressed to the competent regional authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Contrary to the case of the Operational Programme ‘Environment’, a Member State is not required to inform the Commission of the progress of each individual project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, as a postscript to this report, since the process is apparently drawing to a close, let me take the opportunity to express my sincere thanks to all those Members who have supported me in this work over a period of more than one and a half years. My special thanks go to Mr Becsey, Mr Degutis, Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Kohlíček, to the Commission for its strong support and to our Secretariat, and particularly Mr Vervloet. It was certainly very interesting to see how colleagues truly became friends in the course of that year and a half as a result of working together. That is also reflected in the report we have produced. Thank you all very much.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the report itself, we are confronted with a paradox with regard to European airspace. On the one hand, Europe’s airspace has been completely liberalised for the aviation industry and air carriers, while, on the other hand, there are still 27 different civil aviation authorities with 27 sets of rules and ways of thinking which sometimes diverge. As a result, the skies above Europe have not become any safer but are actually less safe than they were. This has led certain airlines to engage in a kind of licence shopping, in which they have tried to obtain their licences in countries where licences can be got more easily and where the rules may not be quite so strictly applied. The consequence has been very many minor incidents, some accidents and some disasters in Europe’s airspace.</p>
      <p sl="de">The idea behind this report – an idea I fully support – was to create uniform rules governing air operations, certification of aircraft and aircraft parts and licensing of pilots. The aim was not only to create uniform rules but also to ensure that they were then jointly and simultaneously implemented. That was the Commission’s original intention, and a large majority of the European Parliament endorsed that intention.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our aspiration, however, was to go further and make it easier to achieve the desired aim. We wanted EASA, the European Aviation Safety Agency, to become more efficient, to be able to act more swiftly and to be more responsive. It was the wish of Parliament that the controlling body of EASA, the Management Board, which still reflected and asserted the national interests of the Member States or the national agencies to some extent in its deliberations and activities, should be given a somewhat more independent position.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second idea was that, since only two options had hitherto been available to EASA for dealing with errors and problems, namely to do nothing or to withdraw an operator’s licence altogether, there was a need to find intermediate responses.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point, which I consider essential, was that one group of staff employed in air operations with special responsibility for safety, namely cabin crews, was still the only uncertificated category of personnel in the entire field of aviation and that this had to be changed.</p>
      <p sl="de">What has been achieved? With regard to the Management Board, we succeeded in improving the situation by securing an obligation on its members to submit a report to the competent committee of the European Parliament. We also managed to introduce a system of penalties which enables EASA to respond flexibly instead of having to choose between the so-called ‘nuclear option’ and no action at all. Above all, we also succeeded in finding a means of ensuring that cabin staff will henceforth be licensed. In other words, a uniformly high level of training, safety standards and all the accompanying attributes will now be found among cabin crews too.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have managed to deliver a report that has largely won the acceptance of all parties. The industry was content with the report, the trade union was content, the employees were content, our House was content, and all but a few of the Member States were content with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most important success, however, lies in the fact that passengers in Europe’s aircraft will be safer in future. That was the most important thing we could have achieved, and we have achieved it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mr Leichtfried, ladies and gentlemen, we are now on the verge of obtaining agreement at second reading with the Council on an extremely important proposal. We owe this especially to the fine work by the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, who I wish to congratulate specifically. We also owe this result to the spirit of compromise among all the shadow rapporteurs, and I wish to express my thanks to them also.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to remind you of the approach underlying this proposal for a regulation. On adopting Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002, laying down common rules in relation to airworthiness and establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency, it was agreed that an optimum and uniform level of safety could only be secured by extending the scope of this text and, therefore, extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency to air operations, pilots’ licences and safety of airline companies in third countries: this is the purpose of the amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002. Furthermore, this proposal intends to step up controls and penalties in the event of non-compliance with these rules and, in the light of experience, to improve the functioning of the European Aviation Safety Agency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council’s common position generally follows the proposal made by the Commission, even though a number of provisions, such as those relating to the Agency’s governance, have been reduced. The common position also takes account of a number of amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our three institutions have worked hard in recent months to reach an agreement at second reading. Some major improvements were made thanks to amendments by Parliament. This has produced a system of fines, as Mr Leichtfried has just told us, which will allow the Commission to give a tailored response in the event of minor infringements of the safety rules. This option is in addition to the withdrawal of certificates and will add flexibility to relations between the Agency and the entities it administers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thanks to the persistence of Parliament, the initial Commission proposal concerning cabin crew attestations was reintroduced. This is a major step forward in acknowledgement of this profession. The added value of well-trained cabin crew is quite obvious. They have solved delicate situations on a great many occasions. Cabin crew perform a major safety function. A pragmatic solution was also found to flight time limitations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Additionally, in specific discussions on the Agency’s budget in relation to fees and charges, the Commission undertook to take account of the specific situation of small and medium-sized enterprises when reviewing the Regulation on fees and charges, especially the impact on their economic feasibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In relation to the definition of complex aircraft, I feel the compromise is balanced. I understand the concerns of some Members not to overburden certain sectors of the market with requirements. Here the Commission will also assess the economic impact of including aircraft with one or more turbojet engines or turboprops. Concerning possible changes to the system for ultralight aircraft, the Commission will ask the Agency for its opinion on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think I have covered all the major points in the compromise. The Commission can therefore easily accommodate these amendments which reflect a negotiated compromise between the three institutions. I again thank Parliament and the Council for allowing a rapid second reading. Rapid adoption of this text will also guarantee the Agency’s reserve for the year 2007. Thus, the last phase of implementation in the EU of a coherent and uniform set of safety rules will be completed with the proposal that I will make to the College in June 2008 on extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency to safety of airport infrastructure, air traffic control and air navigation services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to your determination and, I repeat, of your rapporteur in particular, we can move European skies closer to maximum safety.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Madam President. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs on my own behalf too, and I think that perhaps in this way we will manage to close this chapter tomorrow at the second reading. To touch briefly upon the compromises for the second reading, which are important for my group: the first is the issue of punishment, which has cropped up many times. The current text has already improved a lot, and I think that there is a lot of protection in it for those concerned. It truly is progress that the licence does not have to be taken away immediately, and I also hope that the built-in system of an appeals authority established by the Commission really will work and not destroy small businesses.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The other big question for my group was tariffs, mainly on the part of the British and Czechs. It is still too expensive for small businesses and – I think – my British colleagues will say so, and I also hope that the obligation, undertaken by the Commission, that we will mention the situation of small businesses even more at the time of the audit, will be noticeable. I considered the composition of the management authority and management administration to be very important, and Parliament really has been given a role of political control here, which I feel is a very important step forward so that the Member States do not send to the administration whatever and whoever they want. Financial independence is also important for this authority so that we can put the revenue into different categories depending on where it was taken from.</p>
      <p sl="hu">To summarise, I would therefore like to congratulate all my colleagues, and to say that I hope the responsibility has filtered through to everyone. It also shows that by joining forces we have, with the Council, been able to bring the issue of cabin crews back to the original Commission level, and it shows that we have been able to find a very good compromise on restrictions of flying time. I would like to thank the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur again for their work.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I wish to congratulate my colleague Jörg Leichtfried on his human qualities and on his ability to make friends in a complex parliamentary confrontation on such a technical issue, but also so vital an issue, in order to ensure safety in such an important sector for European economic development as aviation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also wish to state my satisfaction at the progress made in relation to safety, a difficult and complex issue if ever there were one, with some areas that are totally clear, as today’s report shows, and others rather darker, although I prefer not to say which areas occur to me. Today we have certainly taken another stride towards finalising a long and complicated process, at least part of which began many years ago with the transfer of JAR-OPS requirements to EU-OPS requirements; I refer in particular to the progress made concerning rest and flight time.</p>
      <p sl="es">At that time both Parliament and the Commission committed ourselves to charging the Agency with moving forward on an issue which, though difficult, ultimately filled an inexplicable gap and, at that particular time, required updating. Thus I am pleased that those involved were able to accept this commitment, which I feel was important and was what Parliament was bound to do. All in all, I feel these issues will have to be reviewed following the study and the proposals now being drawn up by the Commission on the situation of the aviation sector in terms of social and employment issues, an important concern.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am also very pleased at the agreement on cabin crew, whose professionalism and certification must be recognised. As the Commissioner rightly said, it is in everyone’s interest from the point of view of safety for training to be improved.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am likewise very pleased at the positive outcome of the definition of helicopters, which at one point had created cause for concern in the production sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also feel the solutions provided on penalties are extremely important, as also Parliament’s control not only in relation to comitology, in the case of flight time, but also in relation to the right to information, in the case of the Management Board.</p>
      <p sl="es">I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his flexibility and clarity in connection with the Agency’s budget, since, as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I feel it is essential for this kind of Agency.</p>
      <p sl="es">To end, I wish to express the hope that the Agency can develop without clashing with Eurocontrol. In my opinion European and worldwide aviation safety needs both bodies, and it needs both to be equally effective.</p>

      <p sl="lt">My thanks to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council. I have found this subject and all the work done on it not only interesting, but also useful.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Despite the fact that after lengthy discussions an acceptable compromise has been achieved on nearly all issues, the Commission’s position regarding the classification of aircraft types up to 7 500 kg according to weight gives cause for concern. The Commissioner has briefly touched upon the subject. This apparently very technical subject is of great importance to the aviation industry and happens to be very complex; therefore, it would have a significant impact on the development of new technologies and their implementation in the aviation industry.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Unfortunately, discussions on this directive have been used not for the first time, to my understanding, to promote internal competition without much consideration being given to the damage caused to the whole of the European Union in terms of outside competition. I have in mind competition with the United States, Brazil and possibly very soon with China.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Personally I am disappointed with the Commissioner’s position on this issue. To some extent I can appreciate the positions of Individual Member States being protected in the European Council. However, the European Commission should not have considered this issue from the narrow point of view of the corporate interests of individual countries. The benefits for the Union and possible harm caused by the implementation of such decisions should have been given serious consideration. In order to avoid bureaucracy, small companies and individual aircraft owners would be forced to use single-engine aircraft produced using obsolete technologies instead of modern twin-engine ones with modern jet technology.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The worst thing about it is the fact that this decision has been made under the disguise of aviation safety. Who has ever heard of a single-engine aircraft being safer than a twin-engine one? Regretfully, this is the understanding of aviation safety shared by the Council and, alas, the Commission today.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today I am not afraid to sound very categorical because, as a pilot myself, I know what I am talking about. I am interested not in the declarative, departmental side of the issue, but merely the practical side. I am sure it will not be long before we start to feel the consequences of this, to my true belief, very wrong position and will then unavoidably have to declare the names of its creators to the aviation community. Nevertheless, I believe in the efficiency of the Aviation Safety Agency and in its position enough to be prepared to undertake another study with a view to assessing these conclusions and perhaps negating them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mr Leichtfried has done excellent work on the task with which he was entrusted. I should therefore like to offer him my personal congratulations and those of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. Sensible compromise should allow us to finalise work on the rules relating to civil aviation in the Union and the safety of air transport.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Air transport operations, licences, training, crew and aircraft of countries outside the Union are also affected. The work we are today involved in is a continuation of the initial 2002 Regulation. In my view, we are dealing with a sensible expansion of the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and improving many financial and management procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question as to whether this is necessary and useful is bound to arise in such a situation. The answer has to be yes, in view of the dramatic increase in aircraft movements over Europe and the need to coordinate connections whilst retaining maximum safety levels. These unifying measures do not really involve restricting the sovereignty of Member States. Instead, they amount to an acceptance by these countries of the highest possible standards in the field of civil aviation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Safety in terms of all stages of the flight itself and also of conditions at airports has to be deemed a priority and must not be allowed to be the subject of conflicts of competence with national authorities. I also anticipate that the competence of the European Agency will be broadened to include matters currently dealt with by Eurocontrol. There is therefore no need for a proliferation of standards.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this context, including third-country aircraft in the scope of EASA actions is particularly important. It will allow checks to be made to establish ex-ante whether an operator from a specific country meets safety standards before being authorised to fly within the Union or to fly into the Union from outside.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Convention on International Civil Aviation signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944 plays a key role in this area. Indeed, we marked its anniversary only four days ago when we celebrated International Civil Aviation Day. I would remind the House that the 2007 slogan for this day was: ‘Global Air Transport – a driver of sustainable economic, social and cultural development’. I trust that it will not be long before the EASA assumes a role within the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), which is a UN body dealing with issues pertaining to aviation at global level. After all, this is a problem affecting the entire world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of fees and charges requires clarification. I very much hope that the Commission will take account of the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises in this regard. The Member from Hungary has already spoken to this effect. We are dealing with a very important issue that will benefit our citizens. We therefore trust this venture will be crowned with success. In addition, we hope the details of its implementation will not prove irritating to passengers as is unfortunately sometimes the case in such situations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would also like to begin my speech with a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried. He cooperated closely with us and always kept us informed. That was a good starting point, for the subject was not the purely technical and administrative matter it might seem at first sight. It ultimately became very clear that, as is so often the case, this was a struggle involving numerous competing interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me deal now with the individual points. I believe – and I hope this reflects a widespread conviction – that a single airspace needs strict and uniform supervision. Divergent investigation standards must become a thing of the past, and at the end of the day we must have an instrument – an instrument with teeth – to properly implement and enforce the blacklisting rules for aircraft based outside as well as inside the European Economic Area. We learned at a hearing that blacklisted aircraft cause far more accidents than all the others. It is, in short, clearly apparent that European rules make very good sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all hope, of course, that we shall now make equally rapid progress on the issue of functional airspace blocks, which continues to be thwarted, as you know, by the national interests of some Member States. That is a great pity as well as being highly detrimental in the long run to efforts to reduce the volume of emissions from air traffic.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether there should be penalties or fines was one of the most complex questions. Yes, I am afraid there is no alternative in our world. We saw that intermediate measures were needed for an efficient system, and these have now been put in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final word on cabin crews: I am very pleased that we have now come up with a sound arrangement. It was high time we did. The recognition of that occupational group must be taken further, and another task on the agenda will be to cut emissions and to make aviation less harmful to the climate than it has been to date.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my thanks to all those whose hard work has brought about the outcome of the conciliation procedure, namely Mr Leichtfried and Mr Props of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). I welcome the ambitious plan of the EASA to simplify testing procedures for aircraft under 1 tonne and for aircraft with a maximum take-off mass under 2 tonnes. The debate so far leads me to believe that Annex 2 will be retained in its present form.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I hope that together we will soon open the door to the LSA category – Light Sport Aircraft – in the internal market for all manufacturers in the EU countries. I do not believe that any of the parties involved would like to see the demise of this promising and developing sector, which has several dozen small and medium-sized enterprises operating within it. We urgently need a set of temporary rules for these enterprises, which are situated mainly in Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy and France. I also hope that, following Parliament’s accommodating approach, representatives of the Commission and EASA will show similar flexibility and vision in regard to the present position of this rapidly developing segment of the world market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that their decision will support further development of the light aircraft sector in the European Union by using the recognised testing and certification procedures, mechanisms and organisations.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I hope that the representatives of the Commission and of the Council will, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, support further development of this branch of the aviation industry, which is so progressive both in technical and technological terms. At this particular stage of development, premature decisions, just as much as prolonged hesitation, could have fatal consequences for the sector. I look forward to further debate and to the proposal on the progressive lowering of contributions of small manufacturers in aviation engineering. I would like to thank you in advance for your support and understanding in this area as well. As a goodwill gesture, I would like to express my full support for the compromise achieved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is no doubt that aviation safety is a vitally important issue and one that we cannot afford to ignore. However, the European Aviation Safety Agency continues to display many failings, especially with regard to its ability to run in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of these inefficiencies, Parliament has in the past decided to suspend funding from the Agency. I am therefore alarmed that, despite these problems, Parliament now appears happy to oversee an extension of the Agency’s powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to highlight the impact that the EASA is having on businesses across the EU, I wish to draw Parliament’s and the Commission’s attention to the case of a company in my constituency. This company, with whom I have much correspondence, will see charges for the issue and renewal of maintenance approvals soar as a result of these new regulations.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to my constituent – whose cost increases I have in writing – maintenance costs will rise from GBP 1 206 this year to in excess of GBP 3 000 next year. This represents an increase of 150%. I am worried, to say the least, that an extension of powers to EASA will represent only an increase in terms of the burden of extra red tape and not the extra gain in safety that we all desire.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until such time that EASA can prove that it is fit for purpose in a manner that is not harmful, especially to small businesses, and in a manner that does not represent yet more red tape, I, along with my British Conservative colleagues, must oppose any further extension of powers to this Agency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my opinion is the exact opposite to that of Mr Bradbourn, but, before I proceed, may I add my thanks to Mr Leichtfried for the report and, of course, for the skilfully negotiated compromise. Extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is a step towards guaranteeing the highest possible standards of aviation safety, uniform pilots’ licences with equivalent training standards, licensing of airlines from countries outside the European Economic Area and uniform training of cabin crew as well as responsibility for the implementation of EU-OPS.</p>
      <p sl="de">By enabling EASA to impose fines for non-compliance with safety regulations, I believe we are considerably enhancing its enforcement powers. This, I hope, will soon put a stop to the sometimes unnecessary and unproductive rivalries and power struggles between the national authorities and EASA. The rapid growth of aviation in Europe makes it essential that EASA should be a strong body with centralised responsibility for overseeing technical safety. In my view, this also means that the funding of EASA must be put on a stable long-term basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that one of the next steps will be to ensure not only that the work of the national air accident investigation authorities in Europe is coordinated but also that their findings are analysed by EASA. That will enhance safety in Europe and prevent whitewashing by the affected Member States. In the long term, and I emphasise the long term, we need a model in Europe that will not only make the national tier superfluous but will also deal jointly with matters relating to safety and accident prevention, as the Federal Aviation Administration does in the United States. That is my vision.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the three-day discussion of this topic has already been completed and we are simply called upon here to agree on a complex issue: complex because it tries to provide a global solution to problems which are specific in their extent.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thus, it is proposed that the Commission should be able to impose fines, as an alternative to EASA’s power to withhold an airline’s certificate in the event of a contravention. Note that under this regulation, the agency in question will be responsible for issuing certificates. This will entail thorough technocratic restructuring and, for this reason, the proposed regulation provides for an independent budget for the agency, so that it does not lose its independence in relation to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Although this ambitious scheme seems to have fitted into a proper technocratic mould, I wonder who will bear the political responsibility for possible future mistakes, a responsibility which is currently borne by the competent national minister or administrator of the Civil Aviation Authority. In this case, then, we are creating, in the name of political unification, an agency which has no reason to exist since these matters could very easily have been organised at multilateral level within the framework of existing mechanisms such as the ICAO. Besides, if there is a problem with flight safety, there is no one to blame but the European Commission, which pushed liberalisation of the sector to the limit, with the result that small private airlines are springing up like mushrooms, without the necessary infrastructure or know-how.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let us not start trying to salvage our mistakes by wasting taxpayers’ money! We now have 22 external agencies of the European Union. At some point we will have to limit ourselves to the ones that are essential.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the oft-invoked ‘European sky’ is still far from being a genuine common airspace, even after more than 50 years of the European Communities. The Member States remain fundamentally unwilling to give up their sovereign airspace for the sake of a united Europe or even to share their sovereignty with Europe. Moreover, common European legislation is lacking in many specific technical areas too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our aim in establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency, or rather in extending its remit, is to forge ahead with a small but important regulatory package. The Commission presented a balanced proposal. The Committee on Transport and Tourism and its rapporteur have, we hope, improved it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the next step of the process, the report has been the subject of successful consultation with the Council, which means that we can now be hopeful of its adoption at second reading tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, as many other Members have done before me, I should also like to mention the rapporteur and thank him for his good work. Together with his shadows, Mr Leichtfried has done a really good job. Let me remind the House, however, that there is still a very great deal to do. Yesterday and today we discussed many unresolved issues relating to air safety. I hope we shall manage to reach a consensus on the remaining key issues of funding, comitology and liquids – a buzzword, perhaps, but one with deeper implications. We need a consensus on these matters if the dream of a common European open sky is to become a reality.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam. President, the objective of the proposal for amending the Regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency is to improve civil aviation safety in Europe. These amendments aim at extending the initial applicability of the regulation to the aircrafts used in the Community airspace as well, obviously within the limits imposed by the Chicago Convention.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One of the subjects that have created controversies is related to the certification of the on-board personnel. The Commission has continuously taken actions to improve aviation safety; it has regularly published a black list of companies that do not meet the safety standards imposed by the European Union. There is already a sixth list published.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The field of air transport has experienced strong development and this development cannot be achieved without meeting the security standards. Low-cost companies are also part of this development and we should specify that, in 2006 alone, approximately 300 new routes were created, which represented approximately 1,800 flights every week. According to a recent survey, in 2006 alone, low-cost companies transported 140 million passengers, such companies being present in 280 European airports. Low-cost companies provide 427,000 jobs directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe this regulation is extremely important for air transport safety. Although there is a possibility to punish non-observance of security rules, we must not create a bureaucratic system, but a flexible one, which would contribute to the air transport improvement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also consider it important to acknowledge certificates for on-board personnel. I congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, since its inception in 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has, sadly, been a benchmark for incompetence. Now it is time to look at the agency carefully. Evidence suggests that safety standards have sometimes been neglected and, after all, the EASA is meant to be a safety agency. What is more important than safety? It is clear the agency has experienced significant difficulties in setting up and operating in a satisfactory way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unaccountable delays still exist in its procedures. It is still not meeting its own objectives and the confusion and disruption are putting the EU at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the UK, regulatory costs are, of course, high because the Civil Aviation Authority is required to recover its costs from the services it provides. But this does not take into account the new increases in maintenance costs and negative impacts on the repair sector caused by EASA.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this agency is not just affecting big commercial airlines or businesses. It is affecting private pilots like myself. I am worried. Take the instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) rating, which I myself hold: the certification that allows UK private pilots to fly by using a plane’s instruments to fly in more unfavourable weather conditions – well, I understand that is now under threat from EASA.</p>
      <p sl="en">Flyer magazine in the UK writes that the IMC’s case is not helped by the fact that it is designed for peculiarly British conditions. The UK weather means pilots need more of an IMC rating than others. The scrapping of this would be disastrous for the light aviation industry in the UK and might lead to thousands of pilots like myself having their certificates effectively revoked. I must ask, whatever else the Commission looks at, please reassure me and so many other pilots about this important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EASA’s performance has been unacceptable. I am afraid it is not yet fit for purpose. A single aviation market is not going to be achieved while distortions remain, while delays in procedure persist and while common sense is not applied to the aviation sector.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am at the disposal of Mr Kirkhope, who is an excellent pilot. If he encounters any difficulties with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) – and I do not believe the Agency has made any controversial moves recently – but, if this were the case, I would be the first to protest and would be at your disposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, I also wish to reassure you that the Agency’s regulation and control function will not involve any tasks requiring additional financial resources, insofar as these tasks are financed by public funds. I simply ask Parliament to ensure that the Agency has the necessary resources so that, as Mr Bradbourn told us, it is not obliged to seek charges which could be excessive in certain cases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I honestly believe the EASA’s track record has been positive. It is of course understood that the Agency’s means of action must be perfected, but I feel we must not underestimate the potential of the EASA for European aviation as a whole. As proof of this, I can tell you that Mrs Marion Blakey, a former Administrator of the FAA in the United States, held meetings with the Agency in Cologne to discuss cooperation since she felt EASA was a high-quality agency. Mrs Blakey told me this personally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I listened very carefully to the comments by Mr Degutis. As I said, the Commission has not ignored your arguments. It will assess the economic impact on the aircraft market, whether or not aircraft are defined as complex, and I wish to tell you that we have taken due note of your request. I note that you are also a pilot, and we will not bring this matter to a conclusion without studying it carefully and taking appropriate action. You were right to persist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, it would be bad form for me to prolong the debate excessively. I particularly wish to thank Parliament. I feel we have made good progress on safety and, as Mr Rack said, on a single European sky imposed in functional airspace blocks. Mrs Lichtenberger is right to say that the blocks are essential for a much more efficient and environmentally friendly sky.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, Madam President, I thank Parliament for its extremely positive work on this issue. There will be subsequent stages in this process – everything in due course – but I believe we now have a regulation that will make European skies even safer. Once again I wish to express my thanks to the House.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Before I finish, I wish to mention another point that I feel is important. In the recent adoption of the Galileo project, 50 million euros were taken from the budgets of several European agencies, and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was one of them. I have always supported the Galileo project because it is especially important in my region, and I am very glad an agreement has been reached on how it will be financed. I wish to point out, however, that we cannot simultaneously increase the powers of an agency and reduce its budget. EASA must not be affected by this levy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">substitute of the author . − Madam President, the subject we are discussing is a requirement that the Committee on Transport has had for some time and which it submitted to the European Commission in order to present a model for internalization of external costs, applicable to all modes of transport. In fact, I requested the Commission to present, by June 2008 at the latest, after examining all options – including of costs related to environmental protection, noise, congestions and health – a generally applicable model, transparent and comprehensive, for assessing all external costs, which would define and act as a basis for the subsequent calculation of charges for using infrastructures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Based upon the intermediate results obtained in developing this model, the Commission should indicate whether the global environmental costs, such as the costs related to climate changes and the recently published costs, related to health, are examined in the intermediate report and if they shall be taken into consideration as a substantial factor in the subsequent assessment and calculations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to mention the fact that the directive we refer to offers the possibility to the Member States to introduce a road tax and, for its calculation, to take into account more cost elements than before. In fact, there is a discussion regarding the inclusion of the so-called external costs, such as those related to environment, into the road fee.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Many Member States are against the introduction of such costs into the road tax, because they think that there is no sustainable model for this calculation, but other countries believe that these taxes will generate income and that, in this way, the necessary funds for developing infrastructure will be created.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also want to mention the fact that it is extremely important to ensure fair competition between the various modes of transport, but also to ensure a reduction of traffic noise.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the proposal the European Commission shall submit will also help us improve transport efficiency and, especially, the efficient use of various modes of transport and, of course, thus will contribute to the overall sustainable development of transport.</p>
      <p sl="ro">24.1% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the 27 Member States come from or are due to the field of transportation. For this reason, it is important for us to know if the environmental costs, such as climate changes, will be a part of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also want to mention that the Eurovignette directive allows Member States to include an additional tax for certain roads in sensitive areas, such as the mountain regions in the Alps and Pyrenees. Any income thus collected should be reinvested in other alternative means of transport and related infrastructures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would also want to ask the Commission if it could confirm to us the fact that, after the European Union ratified the Transport Protocol of the Alpine Convention, the paragraphs in the mentioned protocol regarding the enforcement of taxes on the transport of goods will be taken into consideration in this model. I hope Commissioner Barrot will offer us details regarding the date when a new amendment of the Eurovignette directive in force shall be launched by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to finish this presentation with two additional questions, namely I would like to ask the Commission if these external costs will be internalized not only for road transport, but also for other means of transport, in order to ensure a balance in the development of various modes of transport and, also, I would like to ask the Commission how it intends to monitor the implementation of this Eurovignette directive.</p>

    <intervention id="2-384" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacques Barrot" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Commission carried out a study to collate all publications on the subject and identify the best practices for assessment of external costs. Many of the various methodologies identified referred to research projects financed by the Commission: Unit, ExternE, and other more recent projects. A handbook is now being drawn up and we intend to publish this shortly. This is the first point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the Commission has started work on an impact assessment in relation to compensation for external costs. Many charging options have been identified and submitted for public consultation. The consultation will come to an end on 31 January 2007 and a high-level conference will be held in January 2008 to present the handbook and the results of the public consultation which will add to the ongoing impact assessment. This is our work schedule.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you can see, it is quite intense. The following external costs are being considered: accidents, congestion, air pollution, climate change and noise. The assessment covers all means of transport. It envisages different systems and different economic instruments such as taxation, user rights and emission rights trading. We are assessing the instruments using a model-based quantitative analysis. The purpose of all this is to make our means of transport increasingly environmentally friendly. In accordance with the results of this work, the Commission will issue a communication before next summer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to digress slightly to answer Mrs Ţicău on the Alpine Convention. The aim of the Convention’s Transport Protocol is to establish specific charging systems that take account of actual costs and encourage the most environmentally friendly transport systems. The system introduced by the 2006 Eurovignette Directive to encourage the use of more environmentally friendly transport systems pursues the same objectives as the Alpine Convention’s Transport Protocol. What does the present Eurovignette Directive actually say? It makes provision for obligatory modulation of tolls to be paid as of 2010 by vehicles which pollute up to 100% more than environmentally friendly vehicles. In mountain areas, the Directive aims to internalise the external costs of environmental damage and congestion through an additional toll of up to 25% of the infrastructure toll. Revenue from the additional toll must be reallocated to projects that make a direct contribution to alleviating environmental damage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make myself very clear: this communication, in light of all the work I have mentioned, is an extremely difficult task, believe me. It will allow us to assess the best calculation methods in this field. It will define a methodology that can be used for the various means of transport. In mid-2008, before the summer, in fact, in June, I also intend to submit a report to the College on the assessment and internalisation of external costs. I mentioned a communication, and so I will submit this report, with the agreement of the College, along with a proposal to amend the current Eurovignette Directive. It is clear, but it must be stated, that the proposal in relation to the present Eurovignette Directive constitutes an amendment that will allow external costs to be internalised within the scope of the current Directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This was what I had to say to the House. Madam President, I know all this is at the heart of our sustainable development policy. It is in fact necessary to internalise external costs but, in order to internalise external costs, we must have a Community definition and we must choose the best internalisation methodology.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have tried to be as precise as possible this evening, and I am willing to return to the House to report on the difficult and important tasks required by the report which I will be presenting in mid-2008.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Vice-President, what you said about having commissioned studies and preparing conferences is very heartening, but let me ask you a simple question. I do not intend to ask whether you are going to present a communication by 10 June 2008, but I will ask whether you are going to present, by 10 June 2008, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 11 of the current version of the Eurovignette Directive, what that Directive calls – and I quote – ‘a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensible model for the assessment of all external costs’ and for the assignment of these external costs to operators of all modes of transport. So are we going to get a model for the assessment and assignment of external costs, yes or no? My first question is as simple as that.</p>
      <p sl="de">And so to my second question. If I read the situation correctly, in contrast to the requirement to present a model, you are under no obligation at all to present an amendment to the Eurovignette Directive in 2008. That would no doubt be impossible anyway, because the idea, if I understood it correctly, is to develop a model for the distribution of costs and then, at the implementation stage, to apportion external costs to operators of all modes of transport – inland navigation, sea shipping, railways, private cars and so on. What must not happen is that you begin by undertaking an amendment of the Eurovignette Directive and apportioning external costs to hauliers but take no action to ensure that operators of barges, trains, etc. also meet their external costs. This is why I should like to know whether you will be undertaking a revision of the Eurovignette Directive at the same time as you provide for the apportionment of external costs among the other modes of transport too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two simple questions, and I hope to receive two simple answers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Commissioner for his remarks. As you know, Commissioner, we have been having this discussion about the assessment of external costs since the 1920s, and we Members also proposed various models when we were adopting the Eurovignette Directive. However, since we did not succeed at that time, for political reasons, in incorporating external costs to any great degree into the method used to calculate the road tolls for heavy goods vehicles, we reached an agreement that you – the Commission – would present a uniform method by the summer of 2008. That agreement assumes particular importance in the light of the present discussion on climate change. This being the case, we now have questions to ask. Some of them have already been aired.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, will the Commission present a universally applicable and transparent model for the assessment of all external costs by June of next year, a model that may be regarded as universally binding? When I hear of a handbook, it sounds good, but the term tends to suggest a pick-and-mix catalogue of good practices. What we want, however, is a universally binding method that will not subsequently be called into question.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, will this model take account of the climatic and environmental objectives set by the EU? That is what my honourable colleague Mrs Ţicău asked. In terms of method, that would no easy matter, because all the existing approaches focus purely on the inclusion of current costs and not on the achievement of environmental goals. If the pursuit of these goals were factored in, it would create a prescriptive element – a normative dimension, as it were – whereas the debate has so far been confined to current costs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, it goes without saying that we want a legislative proposal at the end of the day. May I therefore ask when the Commission intends to revise the Eurovignette Directive? Is that its intention, or is this still entirely up in the air?</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, when will this method or model start to apply to the assessment of infrastructure charges for other modes of transport too? That precise question has been exercising us, as Georg Jarzembowski said. We want to get rid of the distorted competition between modes of transport and raise them all to a common comparable level.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, thank you very much for your remarks. It was quite thrilling to hear what you told us about the process and the timetable. The issue that will be on the table in June is crucial, and not only for the Alpine region. I believe that you – a man of the mountains, as you have described yourself – are patently aware of this and that it is important to you. It has major implications for all roads as well as for all countries whose transport routes, and especially roads, carry high volumes of traffic and for all who live near these busy arteries. The huge costs generated by such heavy traffic place an enormous burden on the countries most affected by it. This burden is more than doubled, according to numerous studies that have already appeared, by external costs. That point must be taken into consideration, and its importance needs to be far more clearly reflected in the actions of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">We shall not be content, however, Commissioner, with a philosophical and mathematical treatment of the issue of assessing external costs. We need implementation, but we cannot wait for twenty years until the last lobbyist has been convinced. Nor shall we be able to wait until the environmental pollution from bicycles has been calculated too. The bottom line is that we shall have to act immediately. We need a proposal for a regulatory instrument in the course of 2008, we need to discuss it, and we need to conduct this debate now, not in twenty years’ time because we have had to wait until everyone has been convinced by governments of countries which are, in many cases, far less seriously affected by the problem than those in the central part of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, the mountains need you to act. Sensitive places such as cities and other protected areas need a written regulation that clearly states what is reckonable. The Member States can no longer bear the burden of environmental pollution alone, and they should not be required to do so for much longer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Vice-President, as has already been said, you described yourself as a man of the mountains at the time of the discussion on the European toll disc, the Eurovignette, and you certainly went a long way towards living up to that name, at least in the context of those earlier discussions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, however, there are more steps to be taken, steps that are probably more important. The time has come to internalise external costs or, if I may switch from Euro-newspeak to a language that people understand, to ensure that we all pay for what we get in the realm of transport and to obtain more knowledge about who generates what costs and surely also more knowledge about how we can recoup the costs from those who generate them.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have presented us today with a timetable which contains initial key elements of what you promised back then. That, I believe, is good, and what you have presented should certainly be welcomed. What is missing, however – and this has already been mentioned – is the absolutely crucial next step. When will there be a proposal for a legal instrument which will ensure that the various infrastructure users are charged on the basis of the true cost of their operations? And there is a wide diversity of users to take into account.</p>
      <p sl="de">We wait with bated breath to see if it will prove possible, and we expect it to prove possible, to achieve this goal in the current legislative term, for only if we actually set this instrument in motion will other major projects that have been approved in recent weeks and months, some of them proposed by you, become sound investments.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we pour a lot of money into the construction of the Brenner tunnel, that will only be a sound investment if a shift in the cost structure actually leads to the desired changes on the transalpine route. In that respect we are confident that you, as a man of the mountains, will help us on this important issue.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, following on from the broad agreement on the need to deal with adapting transport to the challenge of climate change and other effects to make it as sustainable as possible, since this is the only way to make transport competitive in the EU and worldwide, the Eurovignette has proved a useful initial tool to deal with the problems of congestion, pollution and so on, by providing modulation that is both sufficient and quite diverse in terms of its application to a range of heavy vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, in view of the complexity of the problem, a number of questions occur to me, and so I wish to ask the Commissioner whether, in accordance with his offer and the agreement reached with the House, the ongoing studies involve the same measuring rule for all means of transport, and I do mean all of them.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to know whether, after the methodology has been drawn up, the proposals to be submitted will also refer to all means of transport. I feel we cannot miss out on the chance to apply such an important exercise to all means of transport, since all of them are involved, and we need credible solutions for all of them in coherence with the co-modality proposal.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also appreciate information on a number of matters I feel are important. How does he intend to relate the proposed amendment of the Eurovignette and the new methodology for the internalisation of external costs to the ‘green corridors’ that appear in the logistics action plan and which could perhaps represent some scope for an extension to this methodology?</p>
      <p sl="es">How will this financing instrument be added to the current debate on the financing of EU policies? Will the Commission be prepared to extend it to private vehicles also? Would this not be more efficient and less discriminatory? How can we curtail its effects on the additional problems of growing isolation in an increasing number of areas and regions?</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, does he feel that this instrument, the instrument he is now preparing, will prove sufficient on its own to provide finance for public works such as the large tunnels forming part of the trans-European road systems?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Vice-President, you may remember that, in the discussions on the last amendment of the Eurovignette Directive, I was one of those who clamoured insistently for internalisation of the external cost of road haulage operations. Our bid failed. For this reason I am pleased, on the one hand, that we are now heading in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not pleased because I campaigned for this the last time but because I see what has happened in Austria in the brief intervening period. It is no longer merely western Austria that is awash with heavy goods vehicles. We have now reached the point where eastern Austria is congested too, with some of the roads there completely blocked and the area around our capital, around the city of Vienna, already bursting at the seams. For that reason it is high time we finally managed to factor the external cost of HGV operations into the European toll disc.</p>
      <p sl="de">I appreciate, of course, that this kind of system must be applied to all forms of transport, but we have a set of rules in place for HGVs, so that is where we must now begin; needless to say, we must also go on from there to deal with the other modes of transport. I would add my voice to those of my fellow Members who have asked when we are going to be presented with an actual legislative draft.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point I wish to address is that we should perhaps reflect on the fact that this is a problem throughout Europe, and merely prescribing high tolls in parts of certain small countries will serve little purpose. Instead, we ought to come up with a general system. In this context, I wonder whether we should not assess the potential of minimum tolls, at least on trans-European network routes, as a means of adjusting the modal balance throughout Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-391" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jacques Barrot" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I always listen to the House with great interest, but I nevertheless wish to explain a number of points. First of all, since this is a matter of finding the model, as you say, we must take account of the fact that there are certain practices in the Member States and that, before deciding on the model, we must first discuss the calculation methods used in the various Member States. I regret this, but the handbook at least has the merit of opening up public debate to do just that: to find the best model. Now, I cannot understand why the Commission is seen to be on the sidelines of the issue when it has taken the trouble to examine all the practices in the Member States, to gradually find a genuine calculation model that could be used in Europe: on the contrary, I feel we are at the very heart of the matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I should tell you this is a difficult exercise. I also feel I must defend the services provided by the Transport Directorate-General, which at present is compelled to find reliable methods, because if we do not have reliable methods, there will never be any acceptance across the EU of these methods and this model, as Mr Stockmann said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also wish to express my great surprise to Mr Jarzembowski. I am told: we must act, we must take action towards more sustainable transport, transport that is more environmentally friendly, we must support the railways, we must support river transport, and we must support maritime transport. As Mr Leichtfried very wisely said, we have to begin at the beginning, and we can rectify later. Let us begin by improving the present Eurovignette Directive, that is my proposal, if the Commission agrees with me, in June 2008. We will internalise the external transport costs of heavy vehicles because that is precisely how we will encourage the use of other modes of transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, Mr Jarzembowski, at some point in the future we will also apply the calculation methods to these other modes of transport as well. Having said that, we must take one thing at a time. We can hardly take action and do everything at once. That is not possible. We need a method; if we want the EU to accept this policy, believe me, we must act intelligently. I am most determined on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must thank Mr Rack for praising my mountaineering abilities. I do not stop halfway, even when the route turns into a slope or a gradient; one must keep up a reasonable pace to get to the summit.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Golik, for his excellent report on the Commission proposal for a single Council regulation for the promotion of agricultural products on the internal as well as the external markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aim of the present proposal is to merge two existing Council regulations on internal and external promotion into one single regulation. The overall goal of this exercise is totally in line with our simplification exercise and is intended to increase the transparency of the European Union’s promotion scheme for agricultural products. The objective is not to fundamentally change the information and promotion policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The amendments proposed by Mr Golik and his colleagues address several important issues regarding the EU promotion scheme, such as, firstly, more importance and a larger budget for promotion programmes in third countries; secondly, a higher Community share of promotion measures and, thirdly, a lower share of financial contribution by the proposing organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the sharing of contribution between the different partners, you know that the standard Community contribution is 50%, and that the other 50% is shared between the Member States and the proposing organisations, with the latter paying at least 20%.</p>
      <p sl="en">This sharing of the financial burden between the different partners is based on a very long experience with the promotion programmes. If all partners contribute and become financially involved, the chances for an efficient and well-targeted programme clearly increase. For exceptional cases, such as the recent case of fruit and vegetables for schoolchildren, it is possible to increase the Community’s share to 60%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding your idea to emphasise more programmes for promotion in third countries, I am, in principle, sympathetic towards the idea, but it has to be put into the right context. This proposal is simply about merging two regulations; it is not about policy discussions or more money, so the right moment to have this discussion would be when we consider the future of our common agricultural policy, where our priorities should be well reflected in our budget allocation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this does not mean that I am pushing promotion into the background. As you possibly know, in our two recent reforms – the first on food and vegetables, and the one we will, hopefully, finalise at the beginning of next week, namely the wine reform – we have been focusing and underlining the importance of promoting programmes. To take the example of wine, we have allocated EUR 120 million every year specifically for promoting our excellent European wines in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we are on the right track, but let us come back to this at a later stage – this is simply a merging of the two regulations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, effectively, this proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries is intended to harmonise and achieve technical consolidation of two regulations currently in force. This is all part of the broader process of simplifying Community legislation and making it more transparent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to emphasise, however, that in this case simplification is understood exclusively as a technical process. The draft regulation before us does not, unfortunately, refer to the key principles of promotion and information laid down in the European Commission’s implementing provisions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite these constraints, I adopted a considerably broader and more strategic approach to the promotion of agricultural products within the European Union in my report. The European Parliament must be able to refer to the key issues linked to such an important mechanism. This is particularly relevant if we consider the progress of multilateral negotiations at WTO level, and also the changes in the common agricultural policy’s operating conditions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Export subsidies of all kinds are to cease by 2013. This includes Community export refunds. A reduction in customs duties is planned. Under these circumstances, increased action in the area of promotion and information is the only way to maintain the export competitiveness of EU agricultural products. Such action will also help to secure new markets in third countries and increase customer awareness of the benefits of European products, thus stimulating demand.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, none of this will affect market competition conditions. It will not have a negative impact on world trade either. That is why we cannot allow promotion and information action to be sidelined. On the contrary, we should accept them as a European Union priority.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Under the current system, the European Commission draws up a list of specific third-country products on which campaigns may be conducted. This list can be reviewed every two years, whereas the programmes themselves may only be submitted once a year. Furthermore, it is for the European Commission to make the final decision on whether a particular programme will be adopted and on the extent of the financial support it will receive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The 2007 budget for promotion activities only amounts to EUR 45 million, and is decreasing year on year. This is a particularly surprising trend if we consider that the number of countries in the European Union has increased, and that there has been a marked increase in the actions discussed. Such a policy cannot effectively strengthen the Community’s position and increase awareness of European quality standards, notably on third-country markets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Appropriate financial resources are required if these ambitious aims are to be achieved. I therefore believe that the threshold of the Community’s financial involvement must be raised from 50% of the real cost of programmes to 60%. I also propose that the minimum contribution by sectoral organisations to financing programmes should be lowered to 10%, precisely so as to enable smaller organisations to become involved. In addition, the Community’s participation could reach 70% in the case of organic farming and programmes relating to action following crisis situations such as avian influenza and BSE, for example.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Programmes should be universally accessible and more flexible. Including all products and all countries and also allowing organisations to submit programmes at least twice a year will allow swift responses to any opportunities that might arise on the markets, and to any possibilities for producers to expand in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Returning to those aspects of the regulation pertaining to simplification, it would be sensible to include promotion actions in the Regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets. This would improve legislative transparency. It should be emphasised that there is a reference to the Community promotion instrument in the Regulation on the market in fruit and vegetables and also in the draft wine reform you referred to, Madam President. Every effort should be made to avoid a situation in which provisions on resources for promotion are unduly dispersed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture who unanimously adopted this report, the European Commission representatives I met with repeatedly, the 24 Agriculture Ministers from whom I received letters on this subject, and also the relevant national and European sectoral organisations. I should like to express my appreciation for their active cooperation and sensible comments. These consultations enabled me to assess the existing system and also to familiarise myself with the wishes of these countries and organisations so as to incorporate them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I believe that if a suitably larger budget is made available, promotion and information action will allow European producers and farmers to acquire new markets. The ‘Made in Europe’ label will also become better recognised at world level, which is as it should be.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Golik, on his fine work, and also thank him for his splendid cooperation with us as shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, as you rightly pointed out, Commissioner, the Commission is proposing a single legal framework to merge two existing Council regulations into a single regulation for the promotion of agricultural products. The aim is to reduce and simplify procedures to allow this policy to be applied while retaining the specific nature of the action involved, depending on the location at which it is to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an extremely important proposal, as acknowledged in the two proposals adopted and to be adopted on the common organisation of the market in wine. The proposal considers it is important to promote agricultural products. In addition, it does not merely consider promotion inside and outside the EU, but achieves a multiplier effect through national action and private action within sectors.</p>
      <p sl="es">Courses of action have been implemented since the year 2000 to promote the virtues of European foodstuffs to consumers, their high-quality nutritional value, food safety, production processes, animal welfare and so on. The current rules regulating promotion, however – and I mention this because I was in charge of these two regulations at the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture – have a tendency to jeopardise the system, and they must be revised with a view to simplification to allow them to function more efficiently in terms of proper use of funds.</p>
      <p sl="es">The promotion policy must be a modern, flexible and ambitious tool if it is to meet the aspirations of operators. I feel that is the intention of the Commission’s proposal, and that is the precise intention of the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I wish to specifically mention the amendments on the purpose and scope, since it would be beneficial for promotion to be carried out in relation to trade marks and not focus solely on generic promotion.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope the Council and the Commission will take this report into account, and I thank them for their attention.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the simplification of the Community regime for information and promotion of agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries complies with the European Parliament objective to simplify the legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This document is also extremely important because, during this period, we discuss the reform of the common agricultural policy as well and, in this context, the Community mechanisms for promoting agricultural products should play an important role.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Reforms in the field of fruits and vegetables and in the field of wines, as well, will be successful only if Europe manages to promote its agricultural products adequately.</p>
      <p sl="ro">5% of the people who can work in the European Union are directly employed in the agricultural sector and thus contribute to the 1.6% of the European Union GDP.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Once the new treaty comes into force, the codecision procedure shall also apply to the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As socialists, we support global and gradual market openness, yet with correct and especially mutual rules. Our agricultural model involves high standards in the social and environmental field and quality of food products. This also implies that certain costs are ascribed to farmers, but we should specify the fact that environmental protection must also be taken into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The quality of our products should be the main concern of international trade. As socialists, we believe that the “made in Europe” mark should be established, identified and also related to the quality of products according to European standards; the promotion of European Union agricultural products is also extremely important.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, this report reminds me of Alice in Wonderland and, Madam President, it is irresistible to challenge the interpreters by exclaiming ‘“Curiouser and Curiouser!” cried Alice’ . What is going on? Does it really make sense for the EU to use European taxpayers’ money for advertising campaigns seeking to persuade the same taxpayers that they should buy goods they have already financed through subsidies. Of course not. One of the EU’s aims in the common agricultural policy is to guarantee consumers reasonable prices. But, when this is done by financing from taxes instead of by productivity increases, the consumers pay just as much for their food in any case, only by different means. On top of that, the incentive to increase productivity is weakened. So food becomes more expensive in the long run because of this agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The committee advocates restrictions on competition. When tariffs are abolished, production in the Member States is threatened by cheaper products from third countries; and the report proposes increased spending on campaigns aimed at strengthening the Union’s brand and boosting consumption in the Union. The proposal reeks of covert protectionism! We have seen many examples of EU advertising campaigns before.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In 1997 advertising campaigns were run to promote cut flowers produced in the EU when imports became cheaper thanks to the abolition of tariffs. The eminent Swedish columnist, Johan Hakelius, wrote as follows in a leading Swedish newspaper: ‘When EU citizens buy the same kind of flowers all across Europe, of course cohesion and European harmony increase. Tulips are vital to peace’. In this House, it is perhaps necessary to point out that this was intended as irony …</p>
      <p sl="sv">In 2000 the EU had 450 000 tonnes of olive oil in storage, and the EU decided to run advertising campaigns in the northern countries to inform us how good and beneficial olive oil was.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In 2007 the European Parliament voted money for advertising in the milk sector in order to protect it from increased market liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A reform of the common agricultural policy is actually taking place. It is making slow progress, but it is making progress. However, the rapporteur’s proposals take several steps backwards. They seek to replace the reforms which are finally taking place with increased sales promotion measures and information campaigns. The rapporteur puts the blame on the WTO and wants to increase the number of products which should get this support. This is nothing more than unfair competition with agricultural producers in countries outside the EU. The common agricultural policy must eventually be abolished and prices and production be determined by supply and demand, just as happens in all other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We are stuck with an unreasonable system because of unfortunate decisions in the past. Hence it is all the more important that we move in the right direction. The recommendation here is, regrettably, that we should take the wrong direction. The money which can now be released to benefit the population of Europe through tariff reductions, removal of export restitutions and reduced national support must not be frittered away in more appropriations for sales promotion measures and information campaigns. Promotion campaigns and advertising for goods and services must be paid for by the producers, not by hard-pressed taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Europe is on quite the wrong track in this area, as in so many others. The EU must be a Europe of freedom, in which people and businesses compete for the favour of consumers and not for that of the protectionists. For Europe’s sake I wish that I could be optimistic, but unfortunately I cannot.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to thank Members for their contribution to this very important debate. I hope that we can all agree on the fact that it is important that we have a budget available to explain to consumers the high quality of European products, both within the European Union and on the overseas markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must say that I am a bit surprised that this should be considered a protectionist approach, because we are in a situation where all Member States within the European Union and all other players in the agricultural commodity market are promoting their products to the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">On this, we within the European Union have completely clear stands, because we have high-quality products, with regard to the environment, with regard to animal welfare and with regard to the high level of veterinary standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the point of underspending of the budget or the fact that the budget has been decreasing, it has not been possible to spend the money, because there has been no interest on the overseas markets from producer organisations. I hope that this problem will be solved when we merge those two different regulations, so that it is much easier, much more flexible, to handle.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would be open to having a discussion, maybe within the health check, on how we set goalposts for the future of our promotion campaigns for our agricultural products. I think, at the very least, a proper time to have this discussion would be when we have the discussion on the budget for the future, meaning after 2013.</p>

      <p sl="en">With the recent common agricultural policy reforms and possible future developments in World Trade Organisation negotiations, there is clearly a genuine need to enhance Community promotion mechanisms concerning agricultural production. Moreover, the implementation of the Action Plan on Simplification calls indeed for the design of a single legal framework on the promotion of agricultural products for both internal and external markets. Promotion instruments and campaigns should be given the utmost importance when bearing in mind the foreseen tariff cuts, the elimination of export refunds and the Community domestic support cuts. In this respect, it is obvious that we ought to increase the scope and the budget for the promotion of our agricultural production to ensure viable competitiveness for our products on both internal and external markets. As a matter of fact, it is essential to increase the budgetary means to ensure quality promotion instruments and transparent measures within a single and simplified legal framework. More specifically, this morning debate on the wine common market organisation reform is an extremely good example of the urgent necessity to sufficiently invest in efficient promotion instruments and marketing measures within and outside the Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we all agree that information actions and promotion of agricultural products on both the internal and the external markets are essential. We also agree on the need to simplify and harmonise provisions and to limit administrative procedures relating to implementation of the information policy. In addition, we realise that appropriate information and promotion stimulate trade and help to secure markets for products. We all agree too that the sum of EUR 45 840 000 expressed as the level of appropriations for 2007 is far too low.</p>
      <p sl="pl">How should we respond to this situation? What should we focus on in particular? I believe we should concentrate on promoting healthy organic agricultural products, free from GMOs. We should start with young people and educational institutions. Special promotions for schoolchildren should include a range of healthy organic products in addition to fruit.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A labelling system providing important information for the consumer, for example on the origin, quality, production method, safety and nutritional value of the product, is vital to success. This information should be provided on the packaging in the consumer’s local language. Appropriate changes must be made to trade and labelling in supermarkets, especially in the new Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the report we are today discussing on the promotion of agricultural products should contain the word organic in its title. After all, society can only consume a certain amount of food, so we are not so much concerned with consuming more, as with healthy eating and good-quality food.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Many mass catering establishments in the territory of the European Union provide food containing so many chemicals and fertilisers that it is hardly surprising each generation of Europeans is fatter than the previous one. I do not wish to promote that type of food, which has caused European society to be more susceptible to illness and obesity. If we begin to provide our citizens with healthy food, our produce will become renowned the world over. We need to convince the world that Europe produces and sells high-quality food.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly I would like to warmly thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the hard and excellent work he has carried out in the preparation of his report on the proposal to amend the Design Directive. I welcome the fact that this work has eventually allowed the committee to pave the way for liberalising the spare parts aftermarket in the whole Community.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently, there is a situation of different, opposed regimes of design protection, where 10 Member States have liberalised and 17 Member States extend design protection to spare parts. This situation is entirely unsatisfactory for the internal market. In the automotive sector, which is the sector most affected, there is a single market for cars but no single market for their spare parts. This leads to distortion of prices and obstacles to trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed exclusion of design protection in the aftermarket for spare parts is the right and only effective way to achieve a single market in this area. The Commission’s Extended Impact Assessment analysing the options to solve the problem demonstrates this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s figures suggest that, currently, consumers are paying a 6% to 10% premium for these spare parts in Member States which provide for design protection. With the liberalisation, consumers will benefit directly from the increased competition and the completion of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The independent distribution sector will be in a position to put a larger spectrum of parts on offer, including parts from original equipment suppliers, as well as the normally cheaper parts from independent producers. This will lead to more choice and lower prices for spare parts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Liberalisation will also open business opportunities to independent spare parts producers, mostly SMEs, and create a European market of sufficient scale allowing new entrants to emerge. The essential purpose of design protection is to foster competition of forms through design innovation. This can, however, not apply to spare parts which have to be identical in design to the original parts if they are to serve a purpose. The consumer pays for the design when buying a new car or other product; he should not be forced to pay again each time he needs a spare part.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed repairs clause strikes a fair and correct balance between protecting innovation where appropriate and maintaining free trade and competition where necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">European citizens and businesses today need a single market for spare parts which allows for more competition. With this directive we can provide the market with the right key to achieve this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we come today to the provisional end of a discussion that has lasted for 17 years. I recall that, when I was first elected to this House in 1994, we were already trying to get our heads around this issue. We did not reach a conclusion then. All we managed to do in the conciliation procedure was put the matter on ice. A few years ago the Commission presented a new proposal, which has again taken quite some time to deal with, but it can finally be brought to an end now, at least at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is being proposed here and what is on the table is essentially what the Commission has put forward, namely liberalisation of the market in spare parts, albeit with a five-year transitional period for Member States in which spare parts are covered by design protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">For 17 years I have been listening to arguments for and against. Most of them are unconvincing. Allow me to cite a number of examples. First of all, there was the argument that consumer prices would be lower if the repair clause were introduced. There is no empirical evidence at all for that claim – quite the contrary. Comparative data on spare-part prices in Britain, where the market is liberalised, and Germany, where it is not, show that, paradoxically, prices for spare parts are higher in Britain than in Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">Besides, it is not rocket science: vehicle manufacturers must recoup their design costs somewhere. If they cannot recoup some of them from the sale of spare parts, it is logical that they will have to pass them on through the price of new cars, and so cars will become more expensive. In that case too, the consumer is the one who pays.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same applies, by the way, to insurance premiums. Some of the cost of buying new cars, as we know, is covered by insurance policies. If premiums rise, that does not help consumers either. One way or another, they always have to foot the bill.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nor am I really convinced by the argument that the motor industry needs design protection to fend off competitors from the Far East that are threatening its markets, for in no time at all we shall see how the industry finds other ways to protect its spare parts: patenting intelligent car bonnets and intelligent wing mirrors, protecting other parts through trade mark legislation by simply incorporating particular logos into them, imposing conditions of warranty and other practices.</p>
      <p sl="de">The safety argument, as our impact assessment has demonstrated, is not ultimately watertight either, because safety, as we well know, can be ensured by means of type testing.</p>
      <p sl="de">I cite these because I believe that all the arguments that have been advanced are ultimately spurious and have not provided clear answers to the fundamental question.</p>
      <p sl="de">When all is said and done, there remain two key arguments which I recognise. One of them is the copyright argument, which says that exemplary protection must be given in Europe to intellectual property rights, and indeed I take the view that what we are about to adopt here will probably send the wrong signal to China and India and that our task as Europeans is actually to defend the rights attaching to intellectual property.</p>
      <p sl="de">I shall come straight in with the counterargument, however. We have a single European market and – as Commissioner McCreevy quite rightly observed – a situation in which two-thirds of the Member States have liberalised their aftermarkets and therefore do not protect the design of spare parts, while the other third do. The fact is that the creation of a single market in Europe entails the creation of common legal rules, and it is not unusual in such cases to follow the majority principle.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view there has always been a compromise solution, for which I canvassed together with Commissioner Monti back in the nineties. That was the idea of the compulsory licence, which would have meant that any manufacturer could reproduce parts subject to payment of a licence fee to the owner of the design rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, we have a very similar arrangement in the realm of copyright, so no one can tell me that it is not an option. It would have served both to protect the design and to create a market. Regrettably, it did not attract majority support in the House or in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">We were thus left to draw the conclusion that we should liberalise and that we should create a transitional period to protect Member States that needed some time to adapt. Then there remained the issue as to whether five or eight years’ grace should be allowed. My Group, like the Committee on Legal Affairs, opted for five years; I have heard that the Socialist Group favours eight years.</p>
      <p sl="de">The crux of the matter is that, when Parliament votes tomorrow on the question of whether five or eight years should appear in the text, it will be signalling that the Council needs to agree on a transitional period. I know from talks with the Slovenian Presidency that their proposals will tend to aim for a longer rather than a shorter grace period. I certainly wish the Slovenian Presidency good fortune in its efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one thing, I believe, that we should bear in mind for the second reading. Should the Council actually arrive at an agreement, we in Parliament should resolve not to complicate matters at second reading. The issue does not merit protracted wrangling, and it is high time it was brought to a conclusion. The present draft is our contribution to the pursuit of that aim.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after lengthy debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs came out in favour of complete liberalisation of the secondary market in visible spare parts. As we have just heard, the compromise that was reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs provides for a free market after a grace period of five years.</p>
      <p sl="de">I warmly welcome this step, although I personally consider the transitional period to be too long rather than too short. It is a long-overdue step. We have just heard from Mr Lehne that this issue has been under discussion for 17 years. Two and a half years ago, in 2005, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I called for early liberalisation. Unfortunately, the original rapporteur for the lead committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs, kept delaying the process. I do not know whether he had some personal doubts about the point of the project or whether he was unable to resist the heavy pressure from vehicle manufacturers in his own federal state.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whatever the reason, it is irrational that we should have a single market for new vehicles but not for spare parts. Liberalisation of the aftermarket will strengthen competition, will tend to exert downward pressure on prices and will widen consumer choice. It will not hamper innovation; on the contrary, it could actually stimulate innovative activity, since vehicle manufacturers will try to design their products in such a way that makes them more difficult for independent parts manufacturers to reproduce. I naturally support the right to intellectual property and its protection – no doubt about that – but that right is no barrier to market liberalisation. There has, after all, been only one case in which a vehicle manufacturer has brought an action against another manufacturer for design-right infringement in the primary market, despite the fact that there have actually been some very striking similarities between models produced by different manufacturers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Small and medium-sized businesses will also benefit from liberalisation through new market opportunities, which ought to boost employment in the EU and provide substitutes for a number of imports. Lastly, individual consumers will henceforth be able to choose freely between several suppliers. I am sure they will be glad to have that opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, as the rapporteur Mr Lehne mentioned, this issue has concerned the House for 17 years. I have had the privilege of following it from the very beginning, since I worked as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs on the Directive on industrial designs and models. I was subsequently draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the same issue, and have also followed its progress as the representative of the Socialist Group on the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="es">I wish to start by congratulating Mr Lehne on his balanced approach. I feel he has given a magnificent account of the difficulties involved. This is no easy subject, not simple at all; it has both legal complications and economic consequences.</p>
      <p sl="es">I agree with him. I recall the long night of discussions with the Council on the Conciliation Committee as to the final formula – at that time we were considering the possibility of some kind of compulsory licence, although this was rejected – but I think that both the rapporteur and myself, and also Mr Klinz, who spoke before me, are in favour of defending intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">From the legal standpoint, however, the problem in relation to models and to industrial designs in general lies in the fact that the protection we have to give is for the product as a whole. The most important feature is the aesthetic value of the product overall, in other words the design, and the case arising most frequently is car design.</p>
      <p sl="es">Repair parts, in other words, parts which have broken or come loose after an accident or for any other reason, have to be replaced and, as Commissioner McCreevy said, the normal format is a part equivalent to the part replaced. When someone repairs a part and replaces it with an identical part, with no prejudice to the overall design, obviously this person is not committing any kind of plagiarism, but merely carrying out repairs to an object that it must fit. This is the famous ‘must fit/must match’ concept.</p>
      <p sl="es">I feel the formula suggested by the rapporteur is the proper solution, but he has also addressed another issue: there is, of course, another aspect, which is the economic side of the matter. In other words, at present there are a number of countries where the car industry needs this additional income generated by intellectual property rights. As the Commissioner said, however, in order to secure the internal market we must unify the law within the entire European Union, and the crux of the matter is how to reconcile one thing with another.</p>
      <p sl="es">The only way to do this is by means of a transitional period. This means we must give the industry the chance to make preparations over a long period of time in order to take account of the compensating extra income from property rights on ready-made parts, a concept which makes no sense at the present time since we operate on the basis that property refers to the design as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="es">The main issue is this period, as Mr Lehne stated. Some feel the period should be five years – two plus three, we might say – while others think it ought to be longer, a period of eight years.</p>
      <p sl="es">Tomorrow we will find out the positions of all the political groups, and also the various national delegations and individual Members. It occurs to me that this is an issue which will not be discussed along the lines of political parties but rather in accordance with national preferences, individual preferences, or protection preferences by sectors.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, I feel the fact that we have been discussing this matter between the Council and the Commission for 17 years is no bad thing, because there is a general tendency to use the legislative instrument to solve occasional problems, and here the two co-legislators, the Council and Parliament, have been working for some time now to find a balanced solution, a solution that acknowledges the right to protection of intellectual property, the interests of car manufacturers, the interests of consumers and also – why not? – the interests of small repair outlets or even insurance companies.</p>
      <p sl="es">I feel the formula proposed here by the rapporteur is the proper solution. As I have already said, the only item to be determined – and we will learn this through the results – is the right period of time. I think, however, that, under these circumstances, Parliament is giving the Commission the chance to draw up a new legal formula within a short space of time, a legal formula that would save us the customary recourse to the Court of Justice for matters relating to litigation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore feel that Parliament should basically adopt the report, without prejudice to any minor difficulties that might be posed by certain amendments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to start, like many other colleagues today, by stressing the importance of intellectual property rights and the protection of design in general. We need these rights if we want to continue to be competitive, dynamic and innovative and develop our societies.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we also need to make sure that our markets are functioning in an efficient way. The Commission’s proposal could not be more timely. As many have stressed, we have already waited for 17 years, and we have to wait five more. I think the grace period of five years is already long enough, and it certainly gives the automotive industry time to adjust their industry in a proper way.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a good balance between intellectual property rights and the rights of consumers. We have 260 million vehicle owners in Europe, who are waiting to get a ‘spare parts and repair’ clause which is well functioning.</p>
      <p sl="de">This proposal for a directive, and the compromise made by the Committee on Legal Affairs, ensure that all those parts that are attached to the end product when the product is made – which are not really traditional spare parts – can still have full protection under the design directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am confident that the directive will benefit European consumers. The scaremongering by the automotive industry that this would result in the loss of 50 000 employees from the automotive sector or EUR 2 billion losses to vehicle manufacturers is absolute nonsense. I think that it will bring business opportunities for a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and create new jobs for Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="de">It remains to be seen, and we definitely want to see the results in five years and not eight years. I hope this will be the compromise tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the proposal for a directive on legal protection of industrial designs concerns liberalisation of the market in spare parts for the automotive industry. It is estimated that, within the Union, the value of the latter is EUR 10 billion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The common internal market currently only covers the sale of new motor vehicles and most Member States retain provisions protecting designs and must-match spare parts in their national legal systems. This means that the production and trade of parts such as bonnet lids, doors, bumpers and mudguards is not unrestricted. Various national provisions relating to the sector are disrupting competition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In countries applying total design protection such as Austria, France, Germany and the Czech Republic, spare part prices are between 6% and 10% higher on average. The main losers are European consumers and SMEs that would like to enter into the market and engage in fair competition with authorised agents. The opponents of liberalisation are mainly the large motor manufacturers, who argue that independent producers will sell parts more cheaply, as they do not have to bear the cost of designing and developing new products.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission’s proposal represents a further step towards complete liberalisation of the motor vehicle market in Europe. The repair clause is beneficial to consumers. It attacks the monopoly in the spare parts market and promotes competition between producers. Consequently, spare parts will be cheaper and of better quality. It should be highlighted that 11 Member States of the European Union have already implemented the repair clause, with beneficial consequences for consumers. The countries in question are characterised by high competitiveness and fast economic growth. They include Ireland, the United Kingdom and new Member States such as Latvia, Hungary and Poland.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In fact, packaging is generally the only difference between parts produced by independent producers and parts bearing the company’s logo. Independent producers account for 80% of the parts produced, and only 20% are produced directly by the large companies. Design protection has nothing to do with the safety of the parts, because it only concerns their appearance, as was confirmed by reliable studies conducted across the whole of Europe. In conclusion, I should like to say that a five-year period is the maximum to which European consumers can agree.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the market in visible vehicle spare parts is to be welcomed for three reasons. The first is that consumers will benefit from more choice and competition. The second is that we might perhaps see a fall in prices and that we can certainly expect pricing to become transparent, for design costs should be factored into the cost of new vehicles and not recouped through a downstream monopoly in the market for spare parts.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third reason is that the job market in the European Union will benefit, as European parts manufacturers will also be able to produce spare parts for vehicles imported into the EU. So far that has only been possible for manufacturers outside Europe. During the 2004 election campaign I visited a parts factory near Gütersloh. That company will be pleased with these new rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also welcome the fact that important elements of the Commission’s proposal, such as the repair clause, are contained in the draft adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs. As shadow rapporteur for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I had advocated the retention of that clause. I believe the draft brings us another step closer to a genuine single market.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two major defects, to which some of my fellow Members have already referred. One of them is the fact that the former rapporteur delayed the report. In so doing, Mr Radwan did not act as the representative of the European people but as the representative of the Bavarian Motor Works – BMW for short. That was a rather unsavoury episode.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second defect is that the grace period of five years creates rather a long delay. Five years until liberalisation takes effect is a long time; it will delay competition and the beneficial effects of liberalisation. I have heard that the German Government intends to keep stonewalling. That is anti-competitive stupidity. The sad thing is that it has become a trade mark of the German Government. I hope they will desist from such action in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">The bottom line is that we have a compromise with which we can live and which we ought to adopt. I can only echo the words spoken by Mr Lehne, who I wish to thank at this point for all his work: we should bring this matter to a conclusion now and avoid any further delay at second reading.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the subject of today’s debate is liberalisation of the market in spare parts. This would involve authorising producers, other than motor vehicle manufacturers, to manufacture these parts. The report by Mr Lehne is certainly a step in the right direction. I should like to express support for the report’s conclusions, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a supporter of a liberal economy, I realise, as I am sure we all do, that there are two essential prerequisites to a sound and effective liberal economy. These are, on the one hand, the freedom to produce and sell a range of products and, on the other, protection of the original producer’s intellectual property, which is equivalent to protecting his or her copyright.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The point is that complete economic freedom will not be effective if we fail to respect the property of the person who had the original idea. Essentially, that person has a moral right to the product he or she devised and owned first. On the other hand, there can be no economic freedom either if copyright results in monopoly of the market and restricts economic freedom.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am convinced that in this sector, namely the spare parts sector, the situation to date in countries where the original producer’s copyright restrictions applied was de facto economic restriction. Product prices were higher and the intellectual property owner, namely the motor manufacturer, exercised a monopoly. If we wish to achieve a balance between free market legislation on the one hand, and the right to intellectual property on the other, we must nonetheless curtail intellectual property rights to a certain extent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe this report is a step in that direction. I therefore support it and congratulate its author, Mr Lehne. In so doing I am basing myself on economic liberalism, which is the system generating the most efficient, effective and best quality production, provided certain guidelines are observed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am not an old hand who has been dealing with this matter for 17 years, but I am none the less delighted that this compromise worked out by the Committee on Legal Affairs – and our thanks are due to the rapporteur for that – will finally enable us to move into a new phase.</p>
      <p sl="de">No one should underestimate how important it is to consumers whether there is a repair clause, for example, and it is also important whether or not consumers in some Member States remain at the mercy of the monopolistic policies of major manufacturers. It does actually seem that some companies are using high prices for spare parts to compensate themselves for the impact of fierce price competition and are then citing design protection to justify this policy. Naturally enough, many of the lobbyists who have made representations to us have no wish to be deprived of that option, but anyone who goes on to assert that we must save the motor industry by preserving the parts monopoly has failed to understand the economy in all its complexity. The motor industry whinges about the measures it has to implement to combat climate change, and it whinges about insufficient protection of its designs. I do believe, however, that innovative parts of that industry are not whinging but are getting on with their innovation. After all, it is only a matter of protecting designs, not patents. It is high time we learned to distinguish rather more sharply between the two.</p>
      <p sl="de">The safety argument that was also advanced by the major manufacturers was ultimately refuted in the impact assessment, and it should also be noted that the European consumer bodies have delivered a favourable response to the present compromise. Now comes a new attempt to extend the grace period to eight years for countries where high levels of protection are currently in force. I appeal to you that five years is more than enough. I would not like to see this compromise package being unwrapped again. We Greens shall stand by this compromise, and I consider it very important and very desirable that the House as a whole should do likewise.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my fundamental disagreement with the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98/71/EC on the legal protection of designs. My disagreement concerns the proposal as a whole, not just some minor problems with the Commission’s proposal. The proposal aims to deal with competition problems in the automotive industry by an unprecedented curtailment of the legal protection that industrial design rights afford to spare parts. Such an approach flies in the face not only of the Lisbon Strategy but also of the universally accepted and frequently evoked trend towards a greater protection of intellectual property rights, including their enforcement. It is a proven fact that there are no reasons, either economic or legal or with regard to employment, for restricting the rights of design right holders.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should also like to point out the fact that every economy benefits from the monopoly allowed by the legal protection of designs as this promotes more growth. In addition, account should be taken of the principle that intellectual property rights, including design rights, can only be restricted under exceptional circumstances in matters of public interest, which is certainly note the case here. The negative consequences of this directive, if adopted, would be felt most strongly in the European automotive industry. There are ample arguments to suggest that liberalisation of the spare parts aftermarket as proposed by the Commission would actually harm the consumer by introducing low quality and dangerous parts into the market. If the so-called independent producers were to produce standard parts of high quality, thereby requiring advanced technology, such production would not be economically attractive to them.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The excessive nature of the proposed directive can be illustrated by the curious and incomprehensible opinion expressed by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which on the one hand supports the proposal as a whole in the name of the sacred slogan of liberalisation of the internal aftermarket, while on the other it says that ‘the abolition of design protection is contrary to internationally recognised principles of intellectual property protection and would constitute a dangerous precedent for the protection of intellectual property rights in other areas as well at a time when the European Union has undertaken, in particular within the WTO, to press for the acceptance by third countries of a protection regime for intellectual property rights which would put an end to imitation and counterfeiting’. That really needs no further comment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this revision of the Design Directive revolves around the question of whether or not the protection that is rightly afforded to the design of car bodies should be extended to matching visible spare parts, such as wing mirrors and headlights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The consequence of extending – in my opinion overextending – the protection of designs would be to give vehicle manufacturers a monopoly in a market valued at EUR 13 billion. Design protection for spare parts would exempt about 25% of the entire market in spare parts from the scope of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The repair clause proposed by the European Commission ensures that the Block Exemption Regulation, which is the basic law governing the motor vehicle sector, will apply to the entire spare parts and repair market, as is the case at the present time in only Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="de">The transitional period of five years proposed by the PPE-DE Group for the entry into force of the directive is adequate and, in my opinion, more than generous. Let me sound a warning, however, against further delays, including any that might be caused by the Council, because consumers have been waiting quite a long time now for lower repair bills and cheaper insurance premiums while these lengthy discussions have been taking place here in the House and among the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, we should not leave it to the European Court of Justice to determine the inevitable consequence of further inaction but should be creative in our role as legislators. On the basis of the standards we set tomorrow, the Council should endeavour to reach a decision too.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, legal protection of industrial design is intended to protect the benefits of product design, but it must not be allowed to restrict competition and result in unjustifiably high prices. The introduction of the repair clause achieves a fair balance between legal protection of intellectual property and the need for freedom of competition. It also protects 260 million European drivers against a monopoly in the purchase of must-match spare parts for the repair of motor vehicles.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think this is a historic day, as we are finally going to deal with this vexed question and this anomaly in the internal market. I think we should remember briefly how we come to be here.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was involved, before I came into this Parliament, with the issue that has given rise to these discrepancies in the market. Frankly, intellectual property and its sanctity are not an issue here. In fact, this is actually a much more fundamental issue. Intellectual property is, after all, a right granted to producers, but it is a right that they must not abuse in an anti-competitive way. In a number of countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, where this movement started, it was quite clear to the Monopolies Commission at the time that the car manufacturers were abusing that monopoly, and that is why it was removed. Now, that does not in any way undermine the importance of intellectual property protection. I just want to make that clear to a number of colleagues who have made that point.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point I want to make is to draw the attention of colleagues to an important measure that the Internal Market Committee introduced a few months ago – and I was privileged to be rapporteur – on motor vehicle type approval. For the first time, we now have a regime in which independently manufactured parts that are a critical part of the safety and environmental systems of vehicles have to be tested independently to the same standards as the vehicle manufacturer’s own parts. That new proposal effectively completely removes the argument about safety that I heard Mr Strož repeat yet again. That is gone: this Parliament has made sure it is gone.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, we have dealt with the two crucial issues, and I think it is about time we moved forward. I am pleased that the car manufacturers have finally accepted the fact that you cannot re-regulate a market. Colleagues, you know we cannot re-regulate a market. This is an extraordinary anomaly. It has been allowed to go on for a long time. It is something that we want to do to complete the internal market. I think we are being very generous in offering a five-year transition period. I hope the Council will accept that. Let us put this issue to rest and let us go on and tackle the real issue, which is how we have a thriving car industry in the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a number of amendments, Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the proposal for a directive on the legal protection of designs or models.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I regret that the text adopted makes provision in the short term for the elimination of protection of designs and models of visible car body panels. If this decision is upheld, it will have negative repercussions on car manufacturers in the EU, with no real advantage for consumers. The EU regularly issues reminders as to the decisive role of the protection of intellectual property in business competitiveness. For many years the institutions and the Member States have worked hard to secure Community regulations governing intellectual property rights on the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The current proposal totally contradicts this policy and will do substantial damage to Community protection of intellectual property rights. Protection must not be refused for spare car parts, or for many other complex products which are the result of original artistic creativity and major investment packages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Contrary to what has been claimed, although never established, removing protection for spare car parts would not lead to any gains by consumers. End user gains are not demonstrated by the quality-price ratio. It even emerges in a study requested by the European Commission that full liberalisation of the spare car part market would not necessarily benefit consumers in terms of price, due to the number of intermediaries between the suppliers of spare parts and the end user. Removing protection would actually only benefit economic operators who will not be compelled to cover the costs of creation and who, unlike manufacturers who have to preserve their image, will be less concerned with respecting the characteristics that buyers may expect from the product. The Commission proposal could therefore lead to the emergence of parts of poorer quality, or it could at least encourage forgery.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For all these reasons, I regret the position adopted by the Commission. I have stated this and I continue to support the two amendments that I have tabled in plenary, along with fifty of my fellow Members, in favour of a transitional period of eight years to protect designs and models.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about design protection of visible spare parts has indeed been going on for almost an entire generation of Members of this House. We have been discussing this for 17 years, but up to now we have not managed to reach a final agreement on this important economic law or to harmonise the laws of the Member States to a sufficient degree.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is now three years since the launch of the present Commission proposal and finally we are going to vote on a first reading tomorrow. Mr Lehne’s report points us in the right direction. It has respect for the intellectual property of the design of the complex product as a whole and at the same time it gives us the scope for an internal market in spare parts to operate properly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The present fragmentation of the internal market is no longer defensible. It deprives the producer of the parts – by which I mean the independent producer – of the opportunity afforded by the benefits of scale of the internal market. It deprives independent repair companies of the opportunity to choose their own suppliers, and it deprives the consumer of the opportunity or advantage of the downward pressure on prices that can normally be taken for granted when a competitive market is operating properly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, with the new directive – Malcolm Harbour pointed this out just now too, the new directive on the type approval of vehicles – we have also removed the last obstacle, that of safety. It is therefore time to take the plunge and make a final decision. As far as I am concerned, we do not even need this five-year transitional arrangement any more, but as, throughout all these years – 16 of the 17 years of the debate – I too have learned that politics is the art of the possible, I can live with those five years, with that compromise.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To postpone it any longer, Madam President, really would not be acceptable. Let us here choose the internal market. This is an aspect of the internal market which we can very clearly demonstrate is to the advantage of the consumer. Let us make a choice for the consumer.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal intends to allow companies other than manufacturers to produce spare parts, on the basis that this will reduce the price of parts and insurance. This is the idyllic presentation we have heard from the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is nothing to show that there will be any real benefit to consumers. The countries that have already removed protection have not observed any obvious progress. The Commission’s own surveys confirm this, as our rapporteur Klaus-Heiner Lehne has just told us. Removal of intellectual property for designs and models in many industries, not just in the car industry, however, conflicts directly with EU economic and commercial strategy. This means opening the door to forgeries, and offering the chance to dangerous competitors such as China or India to embark on furious production of these items. This is the total opposite of the Lisbon Strategy which wanted to make intellectual property the weapon of competitiveness and innovation. We would certainly be giving our competitors the wrong message with this strategy, and it would be contrary to EU interests within the context of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal is outdated. It is inspired by an ideological attitude which, in 2007, is precariously balanced, since we are now engaged in a crucial battle with new economic giants in order to ensure the survival of our industry. It is hardly the time to throw down our weapons. Commissioner Mandelson goes to Beijing to force the Chinese to respect intellectual property, while over here we are now calling this into question. This proposal ought to be simply abandoned as unrealistic and irresponsible. Now that we are debating the issue, we must behave as good legislators. That is why, at the very least, we lend our support to the rapporteur’s compromise and call on the House to vote for the amendment as signed by 53 Members for a transitional period of eight years.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, we have witnessed how the liberalisation of old monopolies in Europe has created stimulating competition within trade and industry as regards better products and lower prices for consumers. The market in spare car parts is no exception. For many years, car manufacturers have had a strong monopoly on spare parts; this is a significant element of car design. In practice, we are talking about approximately 20% of all spare parts sold in a very large EU market. The total annual turnover is around EUR 42 billion, or DKK 300 billion, according to the Commission’s estimates. According to an EU directive adopted nearly 10 years ago, the Member States still have the opportunity to maintain monopolies that protect the automobile industry to an unreasonable extent.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Commission proposal, which will mean the welcome liberalisation of this market, will have at least three major advantages. Firstly, industry will be stimulated to invest in the manufacture of spare parts, which typically requires large amounts of fixed capital. There is currently no such stimulation, as much of the EU market is covered by monopolies and is therefore closed to non-original after-market spare parts. Secondly, consumers will experience falling prices for spare car parts because there will be more competition between manufacturers. Thirdly and finally, the full implementation of the repair clause should result in falling car insurance premiums. An extremely significant proportion of the spare parts market that is covered by design protection originates from claims that are covered by insurance policies.</p>
      <p sl="da">I must mention Mr Harbour’s remarks on safety in connection with the manufacture of critically important spare parts from all manufacturers. Mr Lehne deserves a great deal of praise for the work that he has done in connection with the report, which I fully support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank all MEPs who have contributed to this debate. I have listened carefully, not only to this discussion, but to other commentary on this proposal for some considerable time. So, in closing, let me stress a few key points.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current situation with a mixed design protection regime is creating trade distortions, which is bad for the internal market, bad for business and bad for consumers. The full liberalisation of the spare parts aftermarket promises net benefits in many respects. It would allow for more competition and access and participation of SMEs in the market. Consumers would benefit from more choice and lower prices. Besides the legal certainty, it would also simplify the daily lives of administrations, courts, companies – especially SMEs – and consumers. Lastly, the proposed repair clause is derived from and is in full accord with the principles of intellectual property protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore ask the European Parliament for its support and repeat what many speakers here have said – but particularly what Mr Lehne and Mr Harbour have said – that the European Parliament will send out a strong signal in favour of a solution that the Community so urgently needs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, very much for his work on this document.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe we should support the report before us today, as the so-called repair clause achieves a balance between legal protection of intellectual property and free competition and consumer protection. This clause aims to prevent the emergence of unjustified monopolies, and its introduction represents a further step towards the creation of a single market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with my fellow Member that in the present global context it is best to prevent a situation arising that would be detrimental to the European Union’s internal market. Pursuant to the Directive now in force, different legal practices exist in different Member States. Research shows that in those Member States that retained design protection for spare parts in their legislation, spare parts cost between 6.4% and 10.3% more than in countries where the market has been liberalised.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I should like to point out that the market concerned has been completely liberalised in Poland.</p>
