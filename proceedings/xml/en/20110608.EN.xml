      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013, on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe [2010/2211(INI) ] (A7-0193/2011).</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, we have had 23 years of financial perspectives, four distinct periods that have helped EU expenditure and income to evolve in a well-ordered way. The existence of the financial perspectives is what has allowed the Union’s programmes to be carried out. This is why this debate and the vote following it are so important to the Union’s finances. Parliament is taking the political initiative in Europe’s budget for the first time. The Commission and the Council will have to react to this proposal and put forward their alternatives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament has drafted a proposal that is defined by consensus and collaboration. It has involved one year of work, 1 100 amendments and 120 commitments, with 11 parliamentary committees and 10 national parliaments having contributed to it. I would like to congratulate all the officials and assistants who have worked over the past year to make this report possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">There has also been institutional cooperation from the College of Commissioners, headed by José Manuel Durão Barroso, with the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, Janusz Lewandowski, having provided particular support. We hope that the proposal they put forward on 29 June will be in line with the recommendations made in our report.</p>
      <p sl="es">We can no longer carry on making more Europe with a smaller budget. We want an end to the bad habit of accepting solemn political commitments that cannot possibly be funded. We have had enough experience on this issue with the Lisbon strategy, and we do not want the 2020 strategy to be another failure that only serves to increase disappointment and euroscepticism. That is why we are making the Europe 2020 strategy the backbone of the forthcoming financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="es">We firmly believe in the efficacy of EU expenditure. One euro administered by the EU budget is more efficient than one euro spent individually by 27 national budgets. We have proved the idea of added value and we believe it can be applied to practically all EU programmes. We call on the European Commission to make this a reality.</p>
      <p sl="es">There can be no European policy without sufficient funding for the agricultural policy and the cohesion policy. That is why we are asking the Council to maintain the level of expenditure for these two policies beyond 2013. Research, development, innovation, investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, trans-European communication and energy interconnection networks, climate change and education are just some of the priorities that this EU budget must cover.</p>
      <p sl="es">Cutting the EU budget is not a viable option for those of us who believe in a competitive Europe. We consider that an increase of at least 5% is needed over the total expenditure in the current financial perspective. This increase is the minimum requirement for meeting the needs of the major traditional policies as well as our new priorities. This 5% is an exercise in political realism, and should be the basis for future interinstitutional negotiation, along with the sensible proposal put forward in this report, agreed between the groups in this Chamber, on a new system of own resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">This period of crisis and rescue plans may be the worst possible time for starting negotiations on the financial perspective, but for all those of us who believe in the EU budget as an instrument needed to transform 27 Member States into a true Union, the challenge is before us, and our sights must be set high enough to tackle it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The good and bad aspects of the report will come out in today’s debate, both praise and criticism. I know it is impossible for this Chamber to give its unanimous support on such a sensitive issue, but I would like to thank the political groups for their generosity in seeking consensus, and the skills they have contributed over this period. Thanks to them, the final report is infinitely better than anything that I could have produced without their support.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro and public debt crisis demand solutions at European and not national level. This is the message that Mr Barroso, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, has been sending the Member States for months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, a European solution means European funding. My group seeks to adapt this funding to the new realities of Europe, both in its objectives and its terms of reference. My question to the Council is as follows: is Europe of the 2020s the same as Europe of the 1960s? Are the state of public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and the position of Europe in the world comparable? I think not. It is clear that Europe today is no longer in any way comparable to the Europe of the founding fathers. It has changed, and it would be irresponsible not to reflect these changes in the ways in which Europe is funded, in other words, in the way Europe is designed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Garriga and the members of the temporary Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 because I believe they have done an excellent job. I have rarely seen such a balanced and reasonable report as the one brought forward by the Policy Changes Committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">In relation to the question of the future financial perspective and its organisation, the kind of Europe that we want is becoming evident. What we need is a budget for the coming years that reflects the ambitions of the EU, including those of the Heads of State or Government, while, at the same time, meeting the expectations of our citizens. What may seem a fairly innocuous debate about figures measured in decimal places will, in fact, dictate the direction of the European Union for the next ten years.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are regularly faced with new proposals for what the European Union should do, what it needs to achieve, and what tasks it needs to prepare for. At the same time, we also find that the financial resources this requires are not available. However, if we transfer more responsibilities to the EU, expecting it to finance ambitious projects, while, at the same time, cutting funding, then we will be guilty of acting against solidarity within the European Union because we will encourage internal divisions in the fight for funds, for example, in cohesion policy. Such an attack on solidarity, which can already be witnessed in a dangerous form within some Member States of the European Union, should not be permitted between the States of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have the Europe envisaged by David Cameron or the Dutch Government – or at least by the party that supports the government in the Dutch Chamber of Deputies – a Europe of ever deeper cuts, a Europe of increasing withdrawal from integrationist development and a Europe of renationalisation. This is a concept that some people will support. However, one can also say that Europe is our answer, as a 21st century continent, to the economic, environmental, financial and migration policy-related challenges in a globalised world. There are two options open to us: we can split ourselves into our constituent parts, ranging in size from Germany, with a population of 82 million, to Malta with a population of 360 000. If it is a question of every man for himself, then Europe will become an irrelevance. After all, even a state with 82 million people, such as the one I represent, will not survive intercontinental competition in the long term. What we need is the strength of the 500 million people and the 27 States in the Community. That is what will make us strong.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is precisely what is expressed by a budget for the next seven years of the financial perspective until 2020. This is a good draft plan. I would be very pleased to see the spirit of the Polish Presidency, as evident in the draft published by the Polish Presidency, shaping Europe in the coming years with the spirit of cooperation it proposes. The States in the Council are negotiating on the financial and economic future of Europe on an equal footing with the representatives of its citizens in the European Parliament. You cannot say ‘We want a Marshall plan for the Mediterranean that will support the development of democracies in North Africa’, while, at the same time, saying ‘We should cut the EU budget’. You cannot say ‘We want to finance the EU budget with 0.8% of Gross Domestic Product’ and then demand compensation when our own farmers are hit by the EHEC crisis, as the Dutch Government has done. Of course we want to help farmers. We have to help farmers. Of course we want to help North Africa. We have to help North Africa. However, then we also need a good, well-balanced, rationally developed, long-term budget as set out in this report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, given his extremely negative reactions to the position of the Dutch Government, I would like to ask my esteemed fellow Member whether he still recognises at all the democratic right of EU Member States to voice their own opinions on behalf of their citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Hartong, of course I recognise this right. I only hope that you also recognise that the position of the Dutch Government cannot simply be handed down ex cathedra, but that it should be debated in a multinational democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have absolute respect for Mr Rutte, who is in favour of a 2.7% increase in the EU budget. I have taken note of this and am pleased that you have listened attentively because the positions of all governments are debated openly in this Parliament. To this extent, I failed to understand the meaning of your question, but what I believe I can glean from it is that you also support democracy. I suppose that this represents some sort of progress.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have here the letter from the representative of Her Majesty’s Government on the SURE report. The letter says that Her Majesty’s Government is disappointed by the draft SURE report. Colleagues, I think that means that we have a very good draft SURE report here today!</p>
      <p sl="de">I have to tell you that beyond the three or four words saying that Her Majesty’s Government is disappointed by the report, the other parts of the letter are a real provocation: a provocation to Europe and the European Union, because their main point is that no increase in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is possible, and that we have to stick to the old MFF, the same figures, the same resources, naturally the same rebates, and certainly the same rebate for the UK. We must change nothing at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">Her Majesty’s Government is nevertheless a government that wants to take decisions, that wants to reform not only the UK but also the European Union. So I do not see why we have to stick to the old MFF and simply continue with the policies of the past. I think that the time is now ripe to say to the public that it is not by cutting this EU budget of 1% [EU GDP] that we will solve the fiscal consolidation of the different Member States of the European Union. This 1% is only one-fortieth of the total expenditure within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are other ways to make savings. Another suggestion that we can make to Her Majesty’s Government is that, if it wants to make savings in the British public sector, it can do so by increasing the role of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me give you three examples. First of all, foreign policy. In the US, there are 28 000 diplomats. In Europe there are 93 000: there are four times more diplomats in Europe because we are not working together under a single foreign policy. There is a saving to be made there. If the British Government invested more in the European Union, they could make savings on their foreign policy, in William Hague’s department. Another example is monetary policy. Around 44 000 people are responsible for monetary policy in the European Union. In the US, there are 18 000 in the Federal Reserve Board. That is three times fewer civil servants.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the British Government wants to make savings, it can join the euro, it can give the European Union more powers and responsibilities, and it can make savings with regard to all those people working on monetary policy in Britain. If it wants to make savings in Great Britain, it can do so in the research sector simply by adopting the European patent immediately. That would make enormous savings in its research budget. That is the answer that we have to give to Her Majesty’s Government.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my group would like to see European financing that reflects Europe’s new realities, trends and aims. Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe’s place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe? Definitely not: they have evolved and changed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It would be irresponsible if we failed to adjust how Europe is financed to reflect these changes. The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year. I would like to congratulate the committee on its work. I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) calls on all Member States to participate fully in this debate. When I say fully, I mean not simply announcing that the ultimate aim is to freeze European expenditure to 2020, nor dismissing out of hand the notion of European own resources. We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets. This is why we are proposing the concept of own resources to the Heads of State or Government: to ease straitened national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me remind you that the European budget has always been balanced, unlike national budgets, which, for the most part, have serious deficits. Let me also remind you that over 90% of that budget is spent on projects that benefit Member States. Lastly, let me remind the Member States that any money which is not spent will be returned to them at the end of the year. Yet we are accused of being poor managers: I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts. So please, let us stop treating the European budget as a strain on domestic finances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be honest: one euro spent at European level brings far greater returns than a euro spent by national governments. Between 20 and 30 cents of one euro of national spending are immediately diverted to repay interest on the national debt. Europeans need to be told the truth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The truth is that without European funding for education and lifelong learning, the brain drain to China and the United States will gain momentum. The truth is that without European funding for research and innovation, our countries would be less competitive globally, while growth and employment would languish. The truth is that without European cohesion funding, the gap between rich and poor regions would widen. The truth is that without European funding, food security policy, energy policy and climate change policy would be unable to match our expectations and aims. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that without European funding for foreign and defence policies, the European Union would have remained in the wings instead of at the centre of the world stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, money is not the only consideration: how the European Union chooses to invest and to implement political priorities to 2020 and beyond will determine Europe’s capacity for influencing the world. The European Parliament – and for once, the groups that have already spoken are in agreement with me – is therefore calling on the Council to give serious thought to its position on the financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the Council is seriously committed to seeing growth and employment pick up, then it needs to use the European budget and Community own resources as a powerful lever. If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe. Our fellow citizens share our ambition and hopes. As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if I may take this opportunity, speaking on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, I want to respond to Mr Verhofstadt who, as ever, has missed the point and who, as ever, is facing in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">If he had read the report, he would have seen that Her Majesty’s Government said that this is a time of crisis in Europe. He would have noticed that economies are stagnating, jobs are being lost and industries struggling to compete in a fast-changing world. What Europe needed is a budget that is relevant, that is adding value and that engages with the people, but what Mr Verhofstadt and his colleagues are offering is more of the same.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a saying: ‘If you do not change direction, you finish up at the point you were heading for when you started out’. This budget needs to change direction. We and Her Majesty’s Government agree that spending should be increased in those areas that add value. We agree: investment in research and development, in trans-European networks for transport, energy and telecommunications should be increased. We agree: education, small businesses and encouraging the Single Market is wise, sound investment and should be encouraged. That will help create jobs and growth. But we do not agree that it is acceptable for this House to take that as a reason to demand a bigger budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">To Mr Verhofstadt, I have to say this. All over Europe, governments are imposing austerity budgets, and this House would be exceedingly unwise if it does not take on board that message, if it chooses to ignore the letter from the five Heads of Government, because what those five Heads of Government were saying is: more Europe is not the answer; smarter Europe is.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need a budget which is more focused. In the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013, we rightly talked about priorities, but then we never acted on it. There was no evidence of a willingness to take tough choices, the kind of choices which are being taken by governments all over Europe at this time.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we accept that there should be increased expenditure on the new priorities but we also think it was time we looked again at the traditional priorities, so here again, it was another missed opportunity for the European budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague if he does not accept that transferring from the national to the European budget some key items of expenditure is going to produce cost efficiencies and economies of scale and save national treasuries money.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I understand Mr Duff’s point and, as ever, the theory is right but the practice is not.</p>
      <p sl="en">Show me the evidence of where transferring that support makes for greater efficiencies through spending by the European Union. Show me the evidence of where it has actually saved citizens money rather than costing them more.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say again, this budget is evidence of a call from Mr Duff and his colleagues for more Europe, not smarter Europe. The United Kingdom Government is asking for better spending, not more spending.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is always interesting to see that, as soon as we start talking about a forward-looking budget, the debate is only ever about ‘how much exactly?’. This debate should actually be about three issues, three priorities which for us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, are crucial.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, we need a vision for Europe and we need to decide what added value the European budget brings to that vision for Europe? Secondly, yes, Mr Ashworth, the budget should be renewed and made greener, it should be a forward-looking budget. However, a forward-looking budget also means shifts in priorities and still more European money. The third priority concerns the EU’s own resources. Make the system fairer and more transparent, and then we can talk about own resources.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let me run through these three priorities, the added value, to begin with. Here, too, the tone of the debate is as if the money which goes to Brussels is disappearing into a black hole. What nonsense, complete and utter nonsense! If you start looking at what can be done at the European level, there are many reasons for spending money at the European level and specifically not at the national level. Take, for example, our diplomatic services, our embassies abroad. Do we want to have 27 of those in all kinds of countries in Africa, or do we want to have a single EU one? The latter means that more money will have to go to the EU for that EU embassy, but it also means that 27 times less money is spent in the 27 Member States. That is dealing with money efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Look also at infrastructure. If we, as countries, build infrastructure, how do we then ensure that this also works across borders, in the field of ​​energy networks? There, too, you need European money. Or take innovation and research. Ensure that they are consolidated so that you see it through together, so that you have economies of scale. Now, that is clever investing. That is a vision of the added value of Europe and that is why we need a European budget.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the budget must be forward-looking. The current budget is too much ‘business as usual’. We have the 2020 objectives for a smart economy, a sustainable economy. We must therefore invest in that. The challenge for the EU is dealing with scarcity, the scarcity of natural resources, but also of labour. The EU must invest in this so that we can deal with it. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development must be renewed and made greener, so that agriculture can become an example of proper and efficient dealing with natural resources. The Structural Funds, too, must respond to new challenges, such as energy. Ensure that the Structural Funds contribute to the objectives we have set for 2020. That is the innovation we should be talking about.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What are the new challenges? Sustainable energy – that means infrastructure and we need money for that; foreign policy – the Arab Spring: what has been the European response? For that, too, we need European money. Poverty reduction within and outside the EU, climate change, innovation, all good reasons for us to act at the EU level.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The third priority concerns the EU’s own resources. The current system is bankrupt. The rebates which the British have, and which the Dutch and the Danes want, that is a bankrupt system. Make it fairer, make it more transparent, or secure own resources for the EU. Consider a financial transaction tax. Then you have a fair system where the money goes to the EU and where we can achieve our own objectives. This is a clever policy. Things do have to change but they must change at the European level, surely?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to put the following question to those Member States which are saying that less and less money should go to the EU, but which, at the same time, are giving all kinds of new priorities to the EU: if you want less money to go to the EU, what are the priorities that we as the EU should work on? Because if you want the EU to receive less money, you also have to make choices. So far, we have heard that there are more and more priorities, with less money. This simply does not add up. Now, that is the question the British and Dutch governments should be thinking about.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, you will understand that the Left has particularly high expectations in relation to the social alignment of the EU and is therefore a little disappointed that your report does not give greater priority to social aspects for the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am sure that the preservation and development of the European model of the social state and the European solidarity principle will be of enormous importance in times of crisis and economic cut-backs. Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course you have enumerated many important challenges, some of which go beyond the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I do not believe that the proposed tentative increase of 5% will be enough to meet these challenges. As Parliament, we should state clearly that we intend providing particular support for a social Europe. Other elements, such as ERD, FRONTEX and ITER may need to wait a little longer. I believe it is wrong to invite the Council to set negative priorities, in other words, cuts.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own-resources system. In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand. This is not just a useful financial instrument, but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the EU is financed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, this involves an important part of financial market regulation. I also believe that we need to do away with the British rebate and ensure that unused EU resources are returned to the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this House will, yet again, be accused of being out of touch with reality if it votes for a budget increase for the period 2014-2020. The reason given for this increase is the funding of the 2020 strategy, the one it is said will take us out of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us recall what happened with the Lisbon strategy; it was an epic failure. Taxpayers’ money was wasted and we should not repeat this mistake. The European Court of Auditors reports a significant percentage of irregularities affecting different policy areas, averaging 2.8% of the budget year after year, and we continue to flow funds to these regions. Projects have seen costs grow by up to three times their original estimates; others suffer delays while being superseded by better technology. Such is the case with Galileo, which has gone from a EUR 7.7 billion budget to a EUR 22.6 billion budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">More than 40% of the budget continues to be invested in the common agricultural policy, while only 4.7% of the workforce in Europe is engaged in this. The common fisheries policy – deemed a failure by Commissioner Damanaki – requires taxpayers to send EUR 1 billion to Brussels every year. The European External Action Service costs an extra 500 million each year and has not yet demonstrated its raison d’être .</p>
      <p sl="en">All these examples should certainly justify not a budget increase but a budget reduction. I would like to think that the UK Government will take a stand, will say enough is enough, and call for a reduction. However it seems its coalition MEPs here favour a freeze. Taxpayers in the UK will not be thanking them.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, on the eve of World War I, the British Minister, Sir Edward Grey, spoke these words: ‘ The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our time’. We have before us the Polledo report on the political priorities of the European Parliament for the post-2013 period. This concerns both the legislation and the budget. This is therefore the vision of the EU on the future of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What terrible intellectual, cultural and political poverty pervades this report! What a tendency towards dictatorship by the European political elite. This Parliament claims that the EU is adding more value at international level than the sum of individual Member States. You are therefore demanding a minimum 5% increase in the EU budget. How ridiculous! What a denial of national sovereignty and what contempt for the citizens and governments of our countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let me make it clear: a right-thinking Member State such as the Netherlands will never be able to agree with this report. MEPs with a fresh, freedom-loving vision should throw this report straight in the bin. Why? Because, otherwise, the lamps will go out in Europe and we will be paving the way for a dark future for our children. My group want the lamps to stay on in Europe and, therefore, we will vote wholeheartedly against the report.</p>

At present, several EU Member States are members of the G8, the organisation of the eight largest economies in the world. In the next 10 to 15 years though, not a single European country will be represented there any more. How can you then insist that individual European countries continue to play a significant role on the world stage?

Europe is so wonderful and so powerful because of its Member States, and so by working together, in close consultation, the Member States are able to speak with a strong voice on the global political stage.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome on behalf of the Commission the report submitted by the SURE Committee. This is a real contribution to the preparations for the next financial perspective, but it is also truly European. It is a genuine European perspective on the future of the European project. This is desperately needed now when we face numerous common challenges demanding common answers in the era named by Mr Schulz as that of a spirit of ‘Entsolidarisierung ’ (‘dismantling of solidarity’).</p>
      <p sl="en">My comment relates not only to the report itself, but also to the proceedings in the SURE Committee – in which I participated, so I know what I am talking about – to the skilful management by Jutta Haug and the role of Salvador Garriga Polledo. That is the broad consensus and majority vote which will probably and hopefully be confirmed today in the plenary. Yes, we share the vision which is contained in the report. Yes, we also say that the European budget is not about the duplication of national budgets, but about delivering common goals beyond the capacity of nation states where European funds can realise economies of scale or create synergies.</p>
      <p sl="en">In short, the European budget should be used where it makes a difference, as it has the nature of an investment and has no deficit. We also share a vision of the so-called ‘traditional’ policies – namely, the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy. Traditional does not mean outdated, but as a mechanism for delivering the goals of the 2020 strategy. When properly shaped in the budget, they could create room for much better and visibly better financing of what was under-financed – i.e. innovation, the management of migration flows, the external responsibilities of the European Union that are now so visible in the Mediterranean area, energy efficiency and, above all, how to connect Europe via the trans-European networks and the other cross-border connectors in energy systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European budget should assume new functions as a toolbox for disciplining the Member States’ public finances, but it cannot be blamed for mismanagement of public finances at national level. It should act as collateral now for the balance of payments facility, but also in the future for the greater use of innovative financial instruments leveraging European budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is asking for a reform of the financing side and we are to respond by indicating new resources. As Mr Daul rightly said, that is how to make the life of a Finance Minister easier – by indicating new own resources for the budget and reducing the direct contribution. Therefore, the package to be presented at the end of June is about figures, the Multiannual Framework Regulation, a new proposal for an interinstitutional agreement, but also about own resources. Specific sectoral proposals should come later, between September and the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me end by repeating once more my conviction that the SURE Committee report is a good input into the discussion about the future of the European Union, and a strong, important point of reference for the Commission. Cooperation between the Commission and Parliament is essential, not only for a good start in shaping the proposal, but also for a happy end to the negotiations which are extremely difficult in the present context.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, for the Committee on Development, this is not just a clear report, but a vital one as well, because it establishes that the European Union will be shouldering its responsibility for the poorest countries during the next seven years and that it will therefore make appropriations to this end in the budget. It establishes that Member States must honour their own commitments. However, Member States still have a long way to go to commit 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to development cooperation. If the European Union works together on development cooperation, it will result in savings, elimination of overlaps and ensure better and more efficient spending.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report stipulates that action on climate change cannot be funded from the development budget. It calls for greater priority to be given to the strengthening of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It calls for new methods of funding besides just subsidies, for example, combinations of loans and subsidies. It emphasises that humanitarian action should continue to have its own independent financial instrument because emergency aid must be neutral and free of the political choices of the European External Action Service (EEAS). With these choices, the European Union remains the most important partner for developing countries in the world and that is vital.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety can also express its satisfaction with the report in the form in which it has been tabled before us. It takes account of the scarcity of raw materials, the threat to biodiversity, the move towards sustainable energy and, in particular – and I find this key – the importance of sustainability for our economy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is one but , however: we live in a time when all Member States are turning over every euro at least three times before spending it. Yet, we are doing something really peculiar. We are spending billions in subsidies, such as environmentally harmful subsidies, on things which we subsequently have to spend many more billions to put right. On behalf of my group, I have therefore retabled the amendment which was adopted by the Environment Committee, namely, to run down subsidies which have a harmful effect on the environment in the period up to 2020. Especially in these times of scarcity, we cannot afford to have that kind of subsidy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, cohesion policy accounts for one of the largest individual budgets in the European Union. We need to develop a new policy that is adapted to the new challenges. We want investment in a modern infrastructure, in research, innovation and the development of new technologies. We want sustainable, integrated urban development and we want a well-educated workforce.</p>
      <p sl="de">The regions need specific subsidies to help them to become competitive and to develop economically. However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany. Eastern Germany requires support. However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="de">This requires a budget that should be no smaller than the current one and that cannot be split into different sectors. We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy. Cohesion is linked with solidarity. However, cohesion is also sensible from an economic point of view and necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">A lack of cohesion is bad news, even for strong national economies. For this reason, we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in his report and I would ask for support for the amendment for once again improving the intermediate categories.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have reached a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development and I would recommend that this House should incorporate the compromise found by the specialist politicians in the Garriga Report. I would ask for your broad support.</p>

      <p sl="it">I feel compelled to remind my fellow Members that the common agricultural policy is enshrined by the Treaties and is one of the few real European policies; it can play an important role in a strategic sector that provides public goods and generates true European added value.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, whenever we talk about the European Union budget and European funds, especially about the future Multiannual Financial Framework, we automatically talk about European added value. I do not think that there is an area or segment in the European Union budget where European added value is bigger, with so little money. However, to ensure that everything we think in this Chamber and all the European projects have a connection to Europe’s population and each European citizen, and that all these projects have a future, the youth of today must believe in the European Union project, they must feel increasingly European and we must significantly increase our investments in culture, education and in youth projects and programmes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I say that for the European Union to have a future, we need more money for education, for culture and for young people. Not to mention sport, which is a priority on the Europe 2020 agenda.</p>

In order to produce a modern budget for the future, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has highlighted some important issues for future work on the budget.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The skills and experience of women must be utilised. We would point out the need for the integration of equality – for equality to be taken into account in the budget. I hear my fellow Members talk about the future budget and increased resources and so on. It is not just a question of increased resources, but also of having the political courage to reprioritise aspects in the budget and utilise the skills that women have. If we do that, we will not always need to call for more and more budgetary resources, but will be able to use the budget to produce modern policies for the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a proper, reasonable offer by Parliament to the Commission and Council for the further development of the budgetary basis of the European Union in difficult times.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, and the committee chair, Mrs Haug, for their work. You have both done an excellent job. Despite all the political differences between the various groups, our work was characterised by a struggle to find joint European solutions. Other institutions could have a little more of this spirit. We want to have genuine own resources, as described in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">Irrespective of other income, the budget is to be financed solely from own resources. In other words, we are being faithful to the Treaty when we demand this. By the way, let us bring an end to all of these extraordinary targeted rebates. This debate should be conducted jointly with our colleagues in the national parliaments without prejudice and with less foaming at the mouth than is evident in some capital cities and commentaries.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we want to know that the unity of the budget is protected and that budgetary policy is not to be taken away from the community budget. When we discuss expenditure, we must refer to the obligations that result from the Treaty of Lisbon. We must provide sufficient finance for the EU 2020 strategy to which we have all committed ourselves. Growth is the basis for economic and social activity.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must discuss European added value and the necessary synergies between the national budgets and the EU budget in greater detail than before because, irrespective of the potential savings to be achieved in the EU budget, a lot of the additional resources required can be discussed in the context of a genuine debate on synergy and potential savings between the EU budget and the national budgets. We must tell the Council clearly that if it refuses to take the path indicated by us today, it needs to indicate which political priorities are to be struck off the agenda and no longer financed. This is required if we are to be honest with our citizens. I hope that the Commission will respond positively to these suggestions from Parliament in its legislative proposals and I expect that the future presidencies will find a way to communicate openly and transparently with Parliament, so that we can complete the assent procedures in the appropriate timeframe.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the EU is currently facing the biggest challenges that it has faced in a very long time. We must try to put an end to the economic crisis and, at the same time, avoid new crises. We need to deal with increased globalisation and competition. Major cross-border investments in research, for example, will be needed. We need to get to grips with the challenges posed by the environment and the climate and with the sustainable supply of energy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need to reverse the devastating trend towards permanently high unemployment and social exclusion that Europe is experiencing, and, in particular, we must try to help with regard to the crisis affecting our southern neighbours. Unfortunately, in a situation where we most need solidarity and well-functioning European cooperation, the threats to the European idea are also growing. Right now, these are directed at the EU budget, among other things.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013, we understand that it can seem strange that, at a time when many Member States are making cuts in their own budgets, we are demanding more money for the EU budget post 2013. However, at the same time, it would be completely unreasonable to ignore these challenges, to give in to euroscepticism and give up the political ambitions that the Member States have given us in the Treaty of Lisbon, for example. We must also remember that large cuts will not benefit the most vulnerable Member States, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, but, on the contrary, will reduce the EU’s ability to support them.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The UK Government is only speaking on behalf of the net contributors and no one else. Therefore, in the report by the Policy Challenges Committee, we have tried to find a reasonable balance between restraint, the ambitions that are needed and a future-oriented reform of policy areas such as agricultural policy. We arrived at a proposal of a 5% increase in appropriations for the next period compared with 2013.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Garriga Polledo, who succeeded in securing a broad majority in support of his report. The point is that this extra 5% is to be used precisely for investments within the key areas that are focused on the future, in particular, research, growth and employment. It is clear that there is a need for action in these areas, and without resources, we will not be able to meet these challenges. To do this, however, we also need to be able to change our view of the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Remember that this EU budget is still lower in relation to the Member States’ economies than it was when Sweden joined in the 1990s, for example, despite enlargement from 15 to 27 Member States. The increase in the EU budget has also been significantly slower than the increase in the Member States’ national budgets, the UK budget for example, which is something else that is not mentioned when Her Majesty’s Government speaks. I, personally, am absolutely convinced that austerity measures are not the only way out of this crisis. We must find a way back to growth and jobs by finding resources for investments, and for that we need these joint actions.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in collating the views of this House. I am sure that we are all in complete agreement as to the challenges that we face. The question is simply how we will get the funds to stretch, and now we are not only talking about funds in the EU, but also funds in the Member States, and that is a balancing act.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In committee, we decided to recommend increasing the future budget by 5%. Five percent sounds like a lot, at least it does if we go home to our own capital cities and explain that we need another 5%. On the other hand, 5% is very little when we consider the challenges that the EU is facing, and when we know only too well that the EU has actually been given a number of new tasks that it really ought to take care of properly, and we cannot do that without funds.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, in order, at the same time, to be credible when asking for more money, we must also have the courage to look at existing structures and existing costs. Our credibility will then increase significantly if we manage to show that we can also reallocate/reprioritise and save money before we ask for more. Now, I am talking about unjustified advantages within agricultural policy as well as the fact that our anti-corruption policy is, to a large degree, not as successful as we always claim it is, and the fact that, to a certain extent, the EU’s administration is rather unwieldy – the very fact that we are here in Strasbourg is an example of this. These are the sorts of things that our group wanted to raise as examples that could be discussed, for this is what will bring us credibility when we later ask for more money.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, we have not always been entirely successful in doing this in this report, which also explains why some of my fellow Members will be pressing the ‘no’ button, or perhaps the ‘abstain’ button, in tomorrow’s vote, even though a large majority of our group supports the report. Many people are, after all, disappointed that we are not able to discuss a new way of allocating existing funds as well.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another issue that we absolutely must address is how we are to finance the EU budget, and in this regard, our group has been very clear. We want a serious debate about what is referred to as own resources, and this is also important in order for us to eliminate the unhealthy elements in the current financing structure: more rebates, unclear and non-transparent arrangements and so on. It cannot continue like this in the future, and in this regard, I hope that we can initiate a constructive dialogue with the Council concerning the future. This is an absolutely crucial issue if the EU budget is to have a positive future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Polish delegation in the European Conservatives and Reformists will vote in favour of adopting the report on the Multiannual Financial Framework. However, this does not mean that we have not noticed the document’s weak points. It is a sheer waste of time to expand upon proposals for own resources and European taxes. Europeans already pay too much in government levies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We need to place greater emphasis on monitoring of EU expenditure and on a critical assessment of current policies in this field. Turning a blind eye to the money wasted will not solve the problem, and it is also unfair to European taxpayers. The predominance of the Europe 2020 agenda may mean that EU policies are reformed at the expense of much more important obligations – those enshrined in the Treaties, which refer to the promotion of economic cohesion between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Yet European added value, which is linked to European cohesion policy, must not be ignored. Its effects can be seen more clearly in Poland than anywhere else. We are not the only ones to benefit from accelerated growth thanks to cohesion policy.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with the statement by Mr Ashworth, which played off a smarter European budget against a higher budget. I do not consider this to be a true alternative. Indeed, we must pursue a smarter budgetary policy by identifying precisely where money can be saved, where management can be improved and where the administration is particularly constraining.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the task of this special committee was to find out how much money we need in order to be able to deal appropriately with the new political challenges faced. Thus, what we need is openness to reform and political courage. We need to organise ourselves in such a way that we can respond to the major challenges posed by 2020. I do not believe that this can be achieved from your position, Mr Ashworth; instead, I would back Mr Böge, who I believe is correct and faithful to the Treaty when he says that we need to have the courage to return to a system that involves what are genuinely our own resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">This will make the European Union stronger and our financing system more transparent. This will make it clearer to our citizens where the money is to come from. From the perspective of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I would like to add that we are mainly thinking of the financial transaction tax because it will regulate financial transactions and give us the opportunity to establish smarter policies. Thus, this is one way ahead that will not strangle the Member States, instead opening up new alternatives for us all. That is why I believe Mr Verhofstadt is right when he says that we must, of course, be prepared to take up joint initiatives such as the establishment of the European External Action Service, while at the same time making savings at national level. Naturally, we cannot just drop one element and add another. European responsibility means paring back national expenditure in order to pool resources at European level. Why is that? It is because together we are stronger and because we can obtain European value added that is good for our citizens, particularly in the areas of research policy and education policy. The major tasks ahead of us are ecological transformation and the establishment of intelligent energy networks. We need money for this and for broadband networks in rural areas. These are the tasks for the future and this requires a smarter and bigger budget.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mrs Trüpel is again sounding her familiar credo: ‘We must have more Europe, more Europe will do us good and more Europe means more money’. We already know the percentage by which she and Mr Verhofstadt would like to see the MMF increase. It is too bad then that we are seeing our citizens moving in completely the opposite direction. The confidence in Europe is diminishing. Our citizens see this House as a money-devouring machine asking for more and more money. Is it not time that you rethought your credo and came up with a different tune for a change, one which is in line with what Mr Ashworth is advocating?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr van Dalen, I believe that you are making a serious political error. If we in Europe fall back into a pattern of following political national self-interest, then we risk destroying 50 years of work on the European project.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we do here is not a waste of money. We must take decisive action against any corruption and financial scandals as they arise. Naturally, we are on your side on this issue. However, when it comes to generating European added value, as we have done in many areas, we need to work together to develop this because, when they go it alone, the national states are weaker in the face of international competition. You will not achieve good results with 27 national states acting unilaterally, but only by pooling forces. This was recognised by the founding states after the Second World War. We should work on developing this, not destroying it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, having been listening to this debate, the speech I am about to make goes against the grain. My first question is this: can a single currency be sustained without a strong European budget? The answer, in my opinion, is no it cannot. The sovereign debt crisis proves exactly that. It proves that if we had a strong budget, there would not have been a speculative attack on the sovereign debts of Greece or Portugal. This is exactly what we must respond to, and I believe that this is the main problem to which Mr Garriga’s report fails to respond. This report lacks ambition.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The possibility of a marginal 5% increase in European budgets only seems a lot to Her Majesty, the Queen of England. In fact, the real problem is that it is not possible to establish priorities for growth and job creation with a European budget that is essentially frozen. It is not possible to respond to the new obligations resulting from the Treaties with a budget that is essentially frozen. It is not possible to think that cohesion policy is succeeding, because it is not succeeding when Europe is regressing towards social divergence internally.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My final observation is that we will vote for the financial transaction tax but we believe it will only see the light of day if Europe has the courage to implement it independently of others.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, much has been said and I would like to add a different note to this meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">Years ago, I was having dinner with the late President Gerald Ford in the United States and he was describing to me how the G7 came about. He said he wanted to have a meeting with Callaghan – I think it was – the British Prime Minister, on some issues and Callaghan said why not combine this with a good game of golf? So Ford said, well, the Canadian Prime Minister, Trudeau, is a good player, we should invite him, and then Trudeau – welcoming the invitation – said he had some issues to solve with the French, so why not invite the French Prime Minister. But then when they all discussed it over the phone, they said the Germans are going to be very suspicious, so we need to invite them to this meeting. And when the Germans accepted, they then said that Italy was chairing the European Union for these six months, so they had to be there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ford then said to me: you know, Niki, this was the first time I realised you have a Union that is so split, divided and unbalanced. One day, you should have a European budget that is strong enough to compete out there in the global world; the guys are going to be very tough out there. Be careful.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Committee on Budgets has been working intensively on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for some time now and the report from my fellow Member is an important contribution to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Never before have the people of Europe had such high expectations of the EU, while, at the same time, criticising it harshly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Three points seem to be important: firstly, above all, the link to the citizens of Europe. It is completely understandable that our citizens should lose their personal orientation against the background of the impact of the structural crisis and the ever-increasing demands of globalisation, inevitably leading them to question the European project as a whole. This is a subject that must be considered carefully when drawing up the next MFF in order to ensure that Europe is better understood, accepted, practised and supported.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly: this acceptance among citizens and at a political level in the Member States will be all the greater if the EU budget can generate tangible added benefits for Europe. It will therefore be regarded as being of value to European unity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly: in addition, we welcome the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy is to be the reference point for the forthcoming MFF, which also entails consideration of the timeframe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, anyone not in the know might come to the conclusion that the European Parliament is behaving irresponsibly by proposing a budgetary increase. I would like to state quite clearly that the work of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 has, above all, been very matter-of-fact and business-like, and extremely realistic. It has been dominated by discussions on how much political decisions will cost. We must remember that the Member States, including those which have published letters, agreed to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Our committee has attempted to give some indication of how much joint political decisions will cost. We take political decisions extremely seriously. If the Member States decide to take certain measures, and we, as representatives of the citizens, are of the same opinion, we must have realistic funds. In this context, the report which will be put to the vote is well thought out and based on compromise. It is a realistic report and, most importantly, it is a report which forms a very good basis for the opening of talks. I think that today, in this Chamber, we can say that the European Parliament is ready to open negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As an MEP from Poland, I would also like to express my strong belief that the Polish Presidency of the European Council will be one which engages in a serious and extremely realistic debate. Since Poland and the Polish Government are pro-European, I believe that this debate, while certainly difficult, will also be extremely beneficial in terms of future measures. What matters most is that negotiations are opened, and Parliament is ready for this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, the plenary agreed and mandated a special committee to draft the position of the European Parliament in relation to the next financial perspective. Now, following exactly eleven months of work, the Policy Changes Committee is presenting the fruits of its labours. This was a task that required discipline and concentration and that could only be achieved by adopting an approach characterised by openness, solidarity and mutual trust. For that, let me express my sincerest gratitude to those Members involved in the creative process.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report we have produced, drawn up under the leadership of Mr Garriga Polledo, is a genuinely good result. It is something of which we can be proud. However, as we all know, good results require not just hard-working Members, but also excellent staff. We certainly had this, not just in the shape of our personal assistants and our group staff, but also, above all, in an excellent secretariat. This super team, led by Monika Strasser, was not just competent and professional, but was also more than usually interested in its work. It was patient and creative, extremely well organised, and, at the same time, spontaneous and flexible. Best of all, it was always cheerful and open. They obviously enjoyed all the hard work. I would like to thank this nine-strong team from the bottom of my heart. Thank you very much indeed.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">From the outset, Mr Garriga Polledo and I wanted to deliver a report that could be supported by three quarters of Parliament. We actually received a majority of more than four fifths in the vote in committee. We were very pleased with this. Our call for a seven-year financial perspective which is expressed in a structure that reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, while, at the same time, respecting all the policies for the European Union and avoiding increasing the European budget to unrealistic levels, must be seen to be reasonable. It is realistic and achievable.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our report contains 174 paragraphs, all of them arguments for more Europe. We genuinely need more Europe. Please read the report. It offers the best basis for convincing our citizens in local debate and for entering into serious negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately notable by its absence today. Thank you for your excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I, too, believe that this is a very well-balanced report with a clear, but also very flexible mandate for the Committee on Budgets, which is to negotiate an agreement with the Council, and I would reiterate Mrs Haug’s call for it to be read – and for it also to be read by those Heads of State or Government and finance ministers who were quick to express their negativity with regard to the result.</p>
      <p sl="da">This has been a sound and sensible process, as has already been said, and I would like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Haug for their excellent work. I would also like to thank the Commission for its very active role. This work has actually enabled us to go through all parts of the EU budget and the various policy areas that we would like to see reflected in the budget. This is therefore a solid achievement. Is the result sufficiently ambitious? I believe it is. We are strengthening the Europe 2020 strategy, which is intended to equip the EU to face the challenges posed by competition from China and other rapidly emerging economies and bring about our switch to more renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would have liked to have seen stronger wording with regard to the common agricultural policy, and I would also have liked us to have investigated the possibility of making savings in the Structural Funds. After all, this is money that the Member States receive back and would very much like to have. I therefore also think that it is necessary for us to have this possibility of a 5% rise, so that there is the opportunity for new policy areas and for meeting new demands, as well as for investing in transport, energy and research – areas that the EU must invest in in future.</p>
      <p sl="da">We have a grip on the EU budget. The report that we are debating and adopting today concerns a ceiling for the EU budget. We are not talking about the specific funds that are paid out, but rather a ceiling, and below this ceiling there must be scope for us to be able to deal with new challenges. We do not know what will happen between now and 2020, and I therefore support this report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, over the last few months, we have been busy preparing the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014 to 2020. We are acting in this just like the puppy and the kitten in the fairy tale by the famous Czech writer, Karel Čapek. They decide to make a cake, and in order to make it really tasty, they throw everything that they like into the pot. The result is a cake that gives them belly ache. I am afraid the same will happen with our budget framework. We are also throwing lots of ingredients and fine-sounding commitments and recommendations into the pot, but we are not at all sure that they will go well together.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We are well aware of how badly the Lisbon strategy turned out. We now have the 2020 strategy and we are trying to make a budgetary framework for it. There is a problem both with the set objectives and with the instruments recommended by the report. In my opinion, the fight against climate change represents the worst of the set objectives, and in the case of instruments, I see a major problem in the so-called own resources and the option of issuing bonds. In reality, own resources mean a new European tax, which I do not want. Eurobonds are a way for the EU to get into debt along with the Member States, which I do not want. For these reasons, I cannot back the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, and I thank him and congratulate him on his work, is an ambitious summary that looks to the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, his report calls for greater resources so that the Union can better implement its objectives as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. It forcefully raises the question of own resources and therefore, indeed, the issue of whether our institution enjoys freedom in its fundamental political act, that of voting on its budget. It proposes extending and expanding common policies, in particular, cohesion policy which has made a major contribution in the past to making the European Union a model of cooperation and understanding between peoples, and may continue to do so in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With the future Multiannual Financial Framework, if we listen to the European Parliament, cohesion policy will be able to move into a new phase thanks to the creation of intermediate regions. Thus, we propose a new package for this fund which strengthens equal opportunities between all our European territories, regardless of their past in economic terms, regardless of their handicaps when compared with more developed regions and regardless of how vulnerable they may be to the economic crisis that we are experiencing at present or any crisis that we may have to face in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Cohesion among the different territories of the European Union is a key, strategic objective on which the very future of Europe depends. The proposals that have been made are a step in the right direction, and if they are acted upon, lay sound foundations for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the vote on the report by Mr Garriga will be a simple choice: choosing a Europe that is moving forward, a vote by people who, leaving aside their political affiliations, believe in the future of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, at this time of serious economic crisis in the euro area, resulting from neoliberal policies, and from a lack of solidarity and economic and social cohesion, it is unacceptable that a break with and change in the policies of the European Union and its financial resources is not being advocated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When experiencing an economic and social crisis, one of the most significant challenges we face is finding a new Multiannual Financial Framework in which the Union budget for economic and social cohesion is significantly increased, whilst obligatory national contributions are reduced to, at most, 10% of the project on the table, particularly for the countries with the greatest financial difficulties; a framework in which there is a commitment to investment, to public services, to support for production, to the creation of jobs with rights, and to the eradication of poverty, social inequalities and all types of discrimination, particularly on the basis of gender. There is also a need to promote peace, cooperation and development aid, and to significantly cut spending on the military and overseas representation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, there is no doubt that we are facing one of the most critical moments in the economic history of the European Union. For this very reason, the committee that we have managed to establish during the course of this year certainly has a fundamental role.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have no preconceived ideas against increasing the budget, although we think we do need to investigate where cuts can be made. It is clear that we need to cut the European budget because, unfortunately, sometimes European funds are not used properly.

      <p sl="it">To cite an example, we would call your attention to the various funds channelled towards the enlargement policy – sometimes we do not know where they end up. What is there to say about the incalculable amounts spent on integration and which have achieved so little? There are also some virtuous regions that do not access the funds, which are then granted to other regions that either fail to use them, or use them poorly or for not entirely legitimate ends.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, obviously, I will have to confine myself to a couple of essential comments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, despite its bulk, I cannot find anywhere in this report a single serious attempt to make proposals for structural savings, for example, the abolition of what, in my view, are totally superfluous European institutions, such as the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and a good few European agencies of all kinds. Nor, indeed, has any attempt whatsoever been made to ask the question of whether Europe would not be wiser to confine itself to a number of carefully defined core tasks. On the contrary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, I absolutely shudder at the repeated suggestions that the EU should impose its own taxes or that it should issue European government bonds, which will sooner or later have to be paid back by somebody. The suggestion in this report that measures of this kind would not increase the total tax burden on the citizens is a lie, of course, and a deception of the worst sort. Besides, this would further undermine the last vestige of supervision and control that the Member States are exercising on the European institutions’ spending diarrhoea.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the current challenges which the European Union is faced with require a firm, sustained EU-level response. The response to these challenges is the 2020 strategy, an instrument created to bring recovery and strength to Europe. The report presented today places the 2020 strategy at the heart of the next MFF being drafted, together with the new situation created by the areas of competence and policies stipulated by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At a time when many Member States are faced with difficult fiscal adjustments, the EU budget, 95% of which is used for investment, must provide a very high level of European added value. The report calls for the continuation of two extremely important European policies – the common agricultural and cohesion policies – at least at their current level. The allocation of resources under these policies must be based on new criteria which will ensure the proper use of resources to achieve maximum efficiency and compliance with convergence and cohesion criteria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The transport and energy policies must be enhanced. Allocation of funding to research and development, at both European and national level, must ensure the progress of all European policies. The seven-year period, the new structure proposed and greater flexibility provide additional security in implementing and adapting to changing priorities. For the sake of stability, the EU budget’s system of resources needs to be rethought so as to replace current national contributions with European resources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Council recently adopted ambitious targets for the EU’s development. This same Council must accept that the 5% budget increase being proposed by the report is the minimum condition for achieving these targets. The forthcoming MFF must be implemented with an economic governance system in place which can ensure the financial stability required to implement European policies. I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Salvador Garriga.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to start my speech by praising the work of the rapporteur and all the members of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE Committee). Above all, I must praise their determination over the past year of work to achieve a majority agreement and majority support in Parliament for a report such as the one we are presenting today. This report is the road map that the European Union must follow if we want to meet the political, economic and social objectives we have set ourselves, and also if we want to overcome the challenges we are going to face in the coming years.

      <p sl="es">If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and innovation, if we want to carry on fighting climate change and investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable development and solidarity between our countries, and if we still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport networks – in short, if we still want more Europe – then we must call for a bigger budget for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why we warn in this report that without sufficient resources, we will not be able to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves. We know that some members of the Council do not agree with increasing the budget – we have seen as much here. They were not in favour in economic boom times either. Now they say it is because of the crisis, but they wanted cuts when the current financial perspective was negotiated too. That is why we are asking the Council, if it does not agree with this budget increase, to tell us which objectives it does not want to be met.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this report, we do not only set out the policies we want to achieve. We also show how to finance them and we put forward a discussion on own resources. This discussion, designed to bring to an end the false debate of the net contributors, seeks funding without hand outs, funding without exceptions, funding that is fair. We have put forward various options for doing this, but I have a preference for one of them, and Commissioner Lewandowski knows very well which one it is: it is the tax on financial transactions or, as it is known in many of our countries, the Robin Hood tax. This tax would make it possible to raise between EUR 200 billion and EUR 300 billion. It is a tax that penalises speculators and would force all those who have profited by gambling with our money to pay up. It is a tax that would increase transparency and reduce financial speculation and, above all, a tax that would not affect citizens, because it would force those directly responsible for the crisis to pay for their excesses.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are really only asking you for one thing: to set your sights higher. We ask you to set your sights higher to ensure that the European project continues on track and does not become stalled, because that would cost us our future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I was born into the European Union in 1975 and it has shaped my political life ever since. That is why it pains me all the more to have to pour cold water on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">When there is talk of increases, then discussions must lead to a consideration of the correct use of resources. Although the report is ambitious in seeking to find the greatest possible majority support from the House, I believe it lacks ambition in the objectives and aims it seeks to achieve in its current form.</p>
      <p sl="de">The agricultural and structural budgets are left untouched. However, more money is being sought for research and development. The only response that occurs to the House and to the report is more money, although there is no clear indication where this money is to come from. We hear talk of the Union’s ‘own resources’, but there has been no definition of what these resources actually are.</p>
      <p sl="de">If people were serious about wanting structural reforms, they could have taken up the suggestion made by David Cameron, for example, of going to the Council and saying: funding is to be frozen, but we demand that unused resources should be able to be carried over to the next financial year, so that we can continue to spend them on viable projects and to save money.</p>
      <p sl="de">The future viability of the EU should not be measured in terms of decimal places. To this extent, I am more than a little disappointed by the present report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this morning, Mr Daul came running to speak here in the plenary on the need for a bigger EU budget, but he was running so fast that he was running out of breath and had to stop speaking. This reflects very well the debate on the multiannual budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU budget is fixed at about 1% of EU GDP; the Commission and Parliament say, ‘that is not enough, we want more money’. Yet the EU is unable to spend the money available; billions of euro in regional cohesion funds remain unspent. Some money has to be returned to Member States. So why do you need more money if you cannot spend the money you have?</p>
      <p sl="en">But then, here in this Parliament we have a couple of ‘Pavlovs’: Mr Schulz, Mr Daul, Mr Verhofstadt, all absent now – they have run away instead of speaking here to focus the budget on quality rather than quantity, for example, by limiting regional and cohesion funds to the poorer Member States, saving 30% of those funds, and investing that money in innovation and future oriented policies. But I am sure that the EU Pavlovs will yet again run into the brick wall of the EU Council later this year.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as has already been said, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, some similar, some different, but in all cases exacerbated by the crisis, national budgets are struggling. In each of our countries, no matter what majority is in government, the budgetary situation needs to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have two options. One is to all act alone, trying to reconcile spending and income, in some cases, according to what I have heard, worshiping austerity as an ends in its own right, making swingeing cuts to public spending and social benefits, thereby exacerbating the situation for citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would plead in favour of the second option, namely pooling our budgetary efforts, making budgetary solidarity work, playing the own resources card, not least through a tax on financial transactions. That is the purpose of the budgetary complementarity that we want to achieve through this convention-style conference, a proposal that we made to the Council during the conciliation procedure and that we have reiterated in this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to work together – the European Union, national parliaments and governments – to find a way of pooling our spending and budgetary approaches. We cannot have our cake and eat it: we cannot make cuts and, at the same time, invest in infrastructure. It is not possible to contribute less but receive more. I think that this convention-style model of dialogue between governments, the European Union, national parliaments and the European Parliament is the right way to rebuild confidence in Europe, both now and in the longer term.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this is a very bad report and one which deserves to be thrown in the bin straight away. Right now, when people everywhere are facing incredibly painful austerity measures, it is too insane for words that we in the European Union should be proposing to spend even more money. To think that we are behaving in that way when things could be so different: no more throwing money around, no funding for cycle paths and crêperies in a country like the Netherlands. We should concentrate our Structural Funds on the poorest countries and only on innovative projects of pan-European significance in the rest of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">According to the report, everything should remain as it is: more money has been requested for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, no reforms of the Structural Funds have been proposed, nowhere are there any concrete proposals for more efficiency. This Parliament ought to be ashamed of itself, in particular, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). While, in the Netherlands, nota bene , the Rutte cabinet is leaving the sick and the disabled out in the cold, the same groups in this House have a burning hole in their pockets. Austerity champions at home, big spenders in Brussels. This is an outrage!</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise several aspects of this important report, beginning with the European Union’s revenue system.</p>
      <p sl="it">By now, it is clear that the current mechanism has too many inconsistencies, the most famous of which is the United Kingdom’s correction mechanism. Various other corrections and compensations have since been added, making the EU revenue mechanism entirely inequitable and anything but transparent.</p>
      <p sl="it">At this point, it would be better to move towards a direct revenue system based exclusively on the gross domestic product of the Member States, or towards a shared and unified form of revenue such as value added tax, for example. Obviously, European citizens must not suffer any extra burdens, nor should Europe replace the tax policies of the Member States, which must remain autonomous and absolutely sovereign in this area.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report sets out various priorities, some of which are important and others less so, but in any case, they are all very expensive. We can raise resources by using instruments such as project bonds and Eurobonds, which must, however, be managed with the utmost rigour so as not to risk the creation of further debt, which would be dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="it">We, as Members of the European Parliament, can make an immediate contribution to improving Europe’s finances. We must, at long last, choose a single location for the work of Parliament, which would bring savings of tens of millions of euro each year. This is not demagogy but simple …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the mocking of Her Majesty’s Government by Mr Verhofstadt when he shared with us his logic as to why Britain should hand over more money and more power to the EU was further evidence of the palpable disdain in which the UK, its national government and its citizens are held by some in this House. What Mr Verhofstadt failed to mention is that other savings are available to the UK. Businesses forced to spend GBP 30 million to comply with EU regulations could save this by taking back control from Europe. UK fishermen would love to have the GBP 3.3 billion in their pockets: the value of the catch lost when the EU let other countries fish in their territorial waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you state that the European budget is not a duplication of a national budget. However, it cannot be divorced from the realities of its citizens. Currently, the UK contribution is GBP 6.4 billion, rising to over GBP 10 billion if the rebate goes. It can only be met by raising taxes, cutting services, schools …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are five questions we need to ask ourselves:</p>
      <p sl="de">The first is: what budget is required for the 2020 growth and employment strategy?</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly: what budget is required by a currency union?</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly: what potential is open to us to make savings?</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly: what budget is required by the United States of Europe?</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly: what role is Europe 2020 to play? Do we want to play a role at all?</p>
      <p sl="de">We, the European Parliament, take our responsibilities seriously. We deal in plain speaking. In Austria, we have a saying: if you do not pay up, the band does not play. We want to achieve our goals, meet our obligations, accept the challenges and keep our promises. More functions, greater competitiveness, more sustainable growth, more jobs, more research and further integration cannot be achieved with less money, without a financial review, without an evaluation of existing disbursement of funds and without our own resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">More Europe will also create a potential for savings in the Member States. More Europe will also create more efficiency and is our response to globalisation, to the future and to sovereign debt.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is it that we want? We do not want to freeze the budget. Anyone seeking to freeze the budget will damage Europe and weaken our ability to fulfil our duties to our citizens. We want to introduce a transaction levy as a resource of our own, accepting the challenges and adhering to the Treaty rather than burying our heads in the sand. That is our strategy. Let us really set the ball rolling and vote in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basic theme in Salvador Garriga’s report is not about finances but policies. I would like to thank him and Jutta Haug, as well as all the fellow Members on the committee, for having this as the predominant understanding during the work carried out throughout the whole year. Financial resources are only a means of achieving the objectives. Policies are what is important and what needs to be highlighted when the next financial framework is being discussed.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We are all aware that budgets are being cut in all the European Union’s Member States. This will also continue in the coming years. These cuts are part of efforts to exit the crisis. However, we must not forget that exiting the crisis also has European aspects: the economic development plan; financial market regulations to prevent this crisis from recurring; the measures currently being discussed on economic governance in the European Union; EU measures which only make national measures more efficient. This is why it is not appropriate for national measures aimed at tackling the crisis and its consequences to be made to clash with European measures.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Involvement in the European Union provides added value. Added value and solidarity are not empty phrases. Explaining to Dutch taxpayers that their contributions to the European Union are being increased is not the same as explaining to Bulgarian or Polish farmers that the subsidy they are receiving is three times less and that they are obliged to compete in the same competitive market. It is not easy to make accusations against Greek taxpayers, who are going through extremely hard times at the moment because the European finance system obtained a huge amount of money from Greece only a few years ago.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Solidarity has specific aspects. These aspects are also linked to the priorities set by the European Union for the coming years. No breakthrough can be achieved for the scientific sector, energy, transport, economic governance or digital technologies unless they are supported by common European policies.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Indeed, we also need to think about how to change the current European budget. It does contain reserves and they need to be requested. However, I will give you one example. These reserves cannot be made available by, for example, all the policies or objectives relating to energy efficiency, transport and so on being incorporated into the cohesion policy. Cutting the resources from existing programmes will not replace the need for additional new resources if we want to set new objectives for the European Union, if we want European integration to provide real added value, including for taxpayers, who rightly watch every penny allocated to the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why we also need to look at the European budget as part of one system: both for economic governance and for managing the single currency. This minimum 5% increase, which is being questioned, is insufficient for resolving all these issues. This is why we must also ask questions about European Project Bonds, Eurobonds and other means of funding.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I have to say that in all my years in this Parliament, the work of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the most pleasant and the most visionary, in short, the most enjoyable – it really is very fine work. It includes everything that is necessary and positive for Europe’s future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I am personally extremely concerned about what we did not do, and that is set priorities. We have taken on board all of the new challenges, but we have also retained all of the old ones. It will perhaps not be possible to deal with both. We should have set priorities. We should have been much more rigorous in setting priorities, but what is most worrying of all in this context is the fact that we have left the setting of priorities to the Council.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the public, the hardworking taxpayers across Europe who actually earn the money which so many in this place are so keen to spend, want Europe to do less and they want Europe to do it better. They want a lean European budget which takes into account the fact that, whether we like it or not, we are living in an age of austerity. They want Europe to focus on the very limited number of areas where Europe can actually add value, and leave the rest of the activities to our Member States. Unfortunately, this report proposes none of these things.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be clear: the suggestion of a 5% increase is completely unacceptable and the idea of so-called own resources is equally unacceptable – it is just a power-grab by the EU. The budget should be modernised, funds should be reallocated to programmes which actually deliver future benefits and not cover up past failures. Financing of euro bail-outs should be left to those countries that actually wanted to join the euro in the first place. Those of us who warned that it was a mistake should not be forced to contribute to it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the report we have in front of us is perhaps the most important one of this period. The European Parliament is the first among the institutions to draft its thoughts about the next seven years, but without prejudice to the Commission’s right to submit proposals. However, this is the only possibility to avoid a scandal about our right to consent that would oblige us to reject the proposal of the Council. Thus, all of our partners know what the European Parliament wants and they can incorporate that into their ideas as far as possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">To my dear fellow Members, may I recommend two documents that are worth reading before you turn your thoughts to rude criticism: the Treaty of Lisbon and the report itself. Supporting own resources is no more, no less than what is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. I consider the message that the European budget needs a slight increase to be very important. Slight in a sense that this 5% will also be modified by inflation, which means that we are not talking about an abnormal increase. It is not about increasing the expenditure on agriculture or cohesion, but about the fact that these cannot be decreased.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Miklós Zrínyi, a writer of dual Croatian-Hungarian origin who lived in the 1600s said – in connection with the Turks at that time – ‘Do not hurt the Hungarians!’ Quoting his words I say: Do not hurt the agricultural policy; do not hurt the cohesion policy; because those who hurt these policies not only hurt the Hungarians, the Romanians, the Slovaks, but all citizens of the European nations. The lesser the voters’ support behind a politician, the more he refers to citizens. I believe that we, who enjoy the support of a greater political force, likewise represent citizens’ interests, and this is the reason why we say: do not hurt the agricultural policy and cohesion!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Chair for the work they have done on this report. The debate today on the report highlights that there will be a fight in the Council on a number of issues, including the overall increase, the UK rebate and own resources. To be fair, apart from the issue of the UK rebate where UK Members will be in a minority of one, I think the Parliament has tried to reach some compromises.</p>
      <p sl="en">When you have long, complicated and important reports like this, compromise is almost inevitable, but I do welcome some of the compromises. I welcome the compromise on the duration and the structure of the next financial perspective. I also welcome the compromise on cohesion policy. I believe that cohesion policy is vital if we are to achieve jobs and growth in the EU post-2013. Therefore, for cohesion policy, we need adequate funding at least at the level we have now, if not more into the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next financial perspective must be about jobs and growth if it is to be relevant to citizens. Therefore, as well as a strong cohesion policy, we also need policies for funding research and development in our universities and SMEs. FP8 therefore needs adequate funding for the future. We also need to invest in our infrastructure in the European Union – infrastructure like transport, energy and improving broadband in many rural areas – and our rural areas themselves should not be forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="en">To deliver all these policies on jobs and growth, we need delivery mechanisms. We also need partners.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for an excellent report and for his excellent work on the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013. One of the main objectives of future financial frameworks is to establish instruments to take the EU 2020 strategy to the grassroots level. There is a realisation in this report that, without a cohesion and agricultural policy that is robust and strong in terms of its budget, this objective will not succeed. Cohesion policy, for example, is not the only tangible instrument that will enable us to develop innovations and create jobs and growth. We need reform, but we can also implement it within these policy sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Consequently, I appeal to you, Commissioner, to ensure that, in the forthcoming financial period, both regional policy and agricultural policy maintain their existing budget levels, in accordance with Parliament’s opinion. I am, moreover, glad that the report also gives consideration to regions where conditions are especially tough, such as the sparsely populated areas of the north.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the key word for Europe is ‘confidence’. The European institutions in general, and the European Parliament in particular, need to restore confidence among the citizens. How can that be achieved?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Firstly, not with more Europe or more money for Europe, but with a better Europe, a Europe with an added value, and Europe should not interfere with matters, such as sport or tourism, which Member States can deal with perfectly well on their own.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, commit the cohesion fund to the genuinely poor regions in Europe. We still have fifty percent going to rich Member States, such as Germany and France. This is unacceptable.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done, which has resulted in a report that enables a good start to be made on building a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), and that constitutes a challenge for the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is an ambitious report, whilst simultaneously being a realistic report. I hope that all the institutions have drawn the correct conclusions from the financial, economic and social crisis that is slow to loosen its grip on us. One conclusion is clear to me: only a united Europe that shows solidarity and strengthened, harmonised and convergent economic governance will be up to the task of successfully confronting the political challenges we have before us.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We need more and better Europe. We need to give priority to the Community method rather than the intergovernmental method. We need to increase the budget.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Europe 2020 strategy has been agreed, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable. It will be the guide for the next financial perspectives. However, this strategy will only be successful if there is a budget corresponding to its activities; to its objectives. As such, the MFF needs to have the financial backing to match the ambition and commitment of the Europe 2020 strategy. Cohesion policy is also the result of the solidarity principle. It is important that this cohesion be economic, social and territorial, and that it act as a pull on the poorer regions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore believe it essential that funding for cohesion policy at least remain at the same levels, along with funding for the common agricultural policy (CAP). It is also important to make progress towards an MFF, more than 80% of whose funds do not come from national budgets.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the crisis compels us to review both national and European Union budgets from the aspect of efficiency and to see how they serve our goals, and how much added value, European added value, they bring to this effect. I would like to talk about a field that has not been mentioned so far today, namely, cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, which was elevated from the competence of Member States to EU policy level by the Treaty of Lisbon. Our desire to achieve great improvement in this field must be reflected in the subsequent budget period.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We definitely have to provide funds for the Stockholm programme, which is a rather ambitious programme. Europe is in need of well-educated immigrants who reach Europe in compliance with the regulations, and of a common migration policy with adequate resources. The events in North Africa have drawn attention once again to the importance of a common European immigration policy, and have shown the need for integration supported by resources and for European solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The last few months have also highlighted the fact that protection of our common values, non-discrimination and human rights also need protection and resources, that we need to simplify the use of resources for the management of extraordinary situations, and that we need our own resources to create a better, stronger and more extensive Europe in the coming period.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, congratulations to the rapporteur for all the work he has done. It is tremendous in terms of the achievement of trying to get a consensus. There are three areas for amendment which I would plead in favour of.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, in the longer term, we need a five-year financial perspective. If it is the case that 2020 is a seven-year dimension, we should have an absolute condition that the next one will be for a five-year period.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is insufficient work done on looking at how we get a statement of assurance for expenditure. Those who are arguing for more money at a European level would have a stronger case if we knew that we had an absolute cast-iron understanding of where the money actually goes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, in reply to Mr Verhofstadt, it is unwise to single out any one Member State when there are a number of Member States which are net contributors to the budget. I would urge very strongly that we should have a limit on the net contribution of Member States as a percentage of GDP because, looking forward, it is unrealistic to think you can get Member States’ approval when their net contributions are doubling at a time of significant austerity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the 5% increase in the budget is explained by spending on the External Action Service, border protection, the war on terrorism, an increase in development aid, support for research and transnational infrastructure. Overall, this request from Parliament is absolutely justified. However, Parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the Garriga Polledo report. We would have more credibility if we were to show where Europe can be more efficient and where money can be saved.</p>
      <p sl="de">This certainly includes the large number of agencies that enjoy an extremely expensive autonomous existence, and agriculture, where some Member States have still not succeeded in introducing a more market-appropriate flat-rate acreage payment scheme. As the rapporteur for the future of structural policy, I would also say that European cohesion policy should also be included here. Happily, many regions have succeeded in exceeding the threshold for the maximum funding of 75%. However, if there is less poverty in the various regions of Europe, then European solidarity may also recede. The money saved could be better invested in European added value, for example, in a smart link between Structural Funds and transnational networks in the border regions. This is currently under discussion by the Committee on Regional Development, as is a proposal for an intermediate category of 75 to 90% GDP, as suggested in the Garriga Polledo report. Perhaps Mrs Krehl was dreaming if she believed that we had already agreed on a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe that the temporary Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the right body to make recommendations for such an intermediate category. We are making things too easy for ourselves if we simply also define the more prosperous regions as requiring particular support. The way I see it, this is an invitation to waste money. We are leaving the tried and tested phasing-out/phasing-in system but are no longer offering any incentive. We are guaranteeing a permanent subsidy for all regions almost up to a level of average economic strength. There can be no future for a system like this in European regional policy. We therefore need to drop paragraph 73 from the report. Otherwise, the report is acceptable.</p>

      <p sl="de">My second point is that significant fundamental resistance to the intermediate category still exists within the political groupings. You are well aware of this. That is why I find your question surprising. I think that you are dreaming when you simply claim that we have come up with compromises and that these are unambiguous.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the debate on the European Union’s financial perspective raises questions about the European project, its scope and its ambition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is laudable because it seeks to mobilise the Union’s budgetary resources in order to comply with the Europe 2020 strategy. This puts it at odds with the narrow vision of most Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Whereas Member States see Europe in terms of their financial contribution, which they want to see reduced, and the financial returns, which they want to see increased, this report argues in favour of strong and integrated Community policies, be they long-established policies or new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution. It is true that a 5% increase in the European budget would be better than the Member States’ budgetary plans for 2012. However, the crux of the matter – and probably the stumbling block – will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are aware of the downsides of austerity policies: how they affect employment and have left growing numbers of citizens despairing. We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions. I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me conclude by saying that we need to impose a tax on financial speculation, which would increase our citizens’ support for a well-financed Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for highlighting the number of challenges in front of us. I also welcome the very clear message in the report calling for a significant increase in research and science because that is one of the priorities we need to have.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say – and I say this to the Commission – that politics and leadership are about priorities. Without priorities, there is no leadership. There are always those tasks and challenges that are more important than others. That is the case with the budget of the European Union as well as in Member States. We need to further increase research and science, but we also need to increase the amount of science and research in regional funding. We need to take into consideration the development of the agricultural markets and decrease the spending there.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let us remember that we need to set priorities at all levels, at the European level as well as in Member States. I must say that I dislike EU-bashing or Brussels-bashing, but I also dislike Member States-bashing, because it diminishes the importance of the spending we have in the Member States: health care, social security, pensions, education. This is not a conflict between the EU and the Member States. This is an ongoing struggle for leadership and priorities. If we do not dare to set those priorities, we do not show leadership.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must say that if we cannot understand the tough situation Member States are in today, we do not understand the reality for citizens. We need to set priorities and not solve problems just by increasing budgets. So I would ask the Commissioner to show leadership, to be courageous, and to remember that research and science, infrastructure …</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013. It begins with the request for coherence between objectives and instruments, and between the new role that the European institutions must perform – in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recession – and the resources that, together, we decide to invest.</p>
      <p sl="it">Such coherence also implies a serious response to the demand for innovation from the public, from the recipients of EU policies, and from Europe’s social groups and industries. We did the same for cohesion, which is a crucial issue for deciding what we want the European Union to be in the coming years. Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew.</p>
      <p sl="it">On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe’s cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the 500 million citizens of the European Union currently make up over 8% of the world’s population.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By 2050, that figure will be 5% or 6%. In 2100, we will make up 3% of that population. This throng of Europeans continues to maintain, largely through national budgets, 2 000 embassies, 27 armies, 50 joint forces and more. I believe China is currently employing extra deputy ministers just to receive all the mighty European ministers who arrive to petition Beijing for favours and bilateral agreements. All of this is starting to look ridiculous on the world stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Dividing up 8% of the world’s population between 30 sovereign budgetary policies is madness. Essentially, that sovereignty remains absolute. Europe manages 2.5% or one-fortieth of total budgetary expenditure in Europe. The Member States’ contributions make up one-fortieth of their national spending. Yet apparently, even that is too much.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us now consider the question of own resources or maybe another time. Let us stop carping about the 2.5% of public spending with which we are supposed to maintain the whole apparatus required to implement the 2020 strategy and to fulfil all the responsibilities accorded to us under the Treaty of Lisbon. We did not devise the strategy and competences: it was the Member States who did that. In view of these realities, Mr Garriga Polledo’s report is modest. Yet there are those who want to restrict us yet further and who would deem the report ambitious. That is why this House should adopt the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is vital to the future of the European project, which should involve solidarity and ambitious aims, particularly in view of the budgetary crises that Member States are currently struggling with.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taking an ultra-liberal approach, the majority of Heads of State or Government in the Council are choosing to keep slashing budgets wildly and are willing to sacrifice investment in key forward-looking policies such as those funded by the European budget. A budget freeze will dent growth, no matter what other Members might say. An increase of at least 5%, as recommended in this consensus report, is the minimum if we are to tackle the challenges and stand together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European solidarity includes the need to finance the 2020 strategy, not least its social objectives, which include combating poverty. The report has also persuaded me that European solidarity should be strengthened by the creation of intermediate regions in order to ensure that the cohesion policy provides fair coverage for the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, another example is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which offers real solidarity for European workers. The report recognises the valuable role played by this Fund. The increase in the Multiannual Financial Framework is necessary. It should not be seen as a burden on Member States because the European budget provides added value and will, in future, include a tax on financial transactions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon created new fields of competence and strengthened Union policies, as reflected in the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2013 to 2020. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garriga, on his integrated report, which sets out the political priorities of a different Europe from the Europe we know.</p>
      <p sl="el">Given the major internal challenges faced by the Union and its citizens and bearing in mind its enhanced international character, we realise that the main objective of its policy must be to reduce the existing social, economic and territorial inequalities. A planned and successful cohesion policy constitutes per se European added value and will surely prove to be to the benefit of all the Member States of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">The new programme and the new seven-year framework are based on actions in the EU 2020 strategy and are designed to help Europe to recover from the crisis, by promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The political priorities and objectives set are to promote employment, to strengthen innovation, research and growth, to address climate change, to improve education levels, to achieve social integration and to combat poverty, alongside policies on immigration and to safeguard resources to develop inaccessible and border areas.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Union budget is the main mechanism for activating solidarity between the Member States and is a strong tool for a reform that could mobilise additional private and public resources to support investments that will act as a catalyst in terms of the exponential effect of spending by the Union. The European budget must be increased and must be based on real own resources if we want a strong Europe for its citizens and towards the rest of the world. The Union budget is a tool for global and integrated development at a time when the Member States alone cannot …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often said that money forms the sinews of war. We must remember that money also forms the backbone of a peace project like the European Union. If Europe really intends to implement the policies enshrined in the Treaties, including the new policies found in the Treaty of Lisbon, it needs the financial wherewithal to realise those aims.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, I am in favour of establishing own resources and a tax on financial transactions. The necessary increase in the European budget must go hand in hand with significant savings from optimising our spending. For example, let us create a real Common Foreign and Security Policy to give Europe more influence on the world stage, but also in order to make the best use of public money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report by Mr Garriga Polledo is crucial, almost a complete recast: it recommends a very strong political and financial framework for the European Union. What is more, two key Union policies are given their rightful place. On the common agricultural policy (CAP), which is crucial for food security and self-sufficiency, the report advocates renewing the CAP budget. On the cohesion policy, which is the financial instrument used to create regional solidarity and encourage regional economic development, the report proposes enhancing its objectives by creating a category for intermediate regions so that regions at the same developmental level can benefit …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to say a few words on the need to move towards own resources reform. I believe that the dominating role of GNI-based revenue makes a decision on the EU budget over-politicised and less efficiency-oriented. It facilitates demands to freeze or to reduce EU spending. It leads to the logic expressed in the context of the 2011 budget negotiations that if we cut our national budgets due to the crisis, we should apply the same approach to the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is, however, not at all obvious that with an additional own resource that would reduce the dependence on GNI, we can expect a revolution in EU capacities to finance growth and structural change. There is always a risk that the same coalition that adopts the budgetary decision in the Council can also adopt the same decision in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we care for Europe, we should move away from responding to the expectations of Finance Ministers and move towards citizens’ expectations. The success of a national politician returning home from Brussels negotiations should not be based on the message that the government will pay less to the EU budget but, for example, on the message that the EU will help to make small companies fund innovation projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that the way EU costs are financed should be fully transparent. This could be easier to achieve with only one tax, but it is also feasible to build the revenue on a group of taxes that meet criteria on transparency, equity, visibility, efficiency and sufficient harmonisation.</p>

We therefore need to significantly increase financing of science and innovation, so as to promote scientific excellence throughout Europe. It is also important to strengthen the European system for financing science so as to realise the objective of investing 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
      <p sl="pt">The new budget should also promote increased energy efficiency and support the construction of future infrastructure, energy infrastructure in particular, thereby creating the necessary conditions for European industry to be competitive. There is a need to increase the role of industry, in particular, that of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), so contributing to reinforcing Europe’s position of leadership in a globalised world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for his excellent work throughout the year, which has received broad political backing. I welcome the message that this report has managed to get across: the solution to the crisis is the assertion of the Union’s status as a global player.</p>
      <p sl="it">The future financial framework mirrors the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and is grounded firmly within the Treaty of Lisbon. However, suitable funding is required for the Union’s priorities to be credible. The development of energy and transport infrastructure, investment in research and development, learning and youth policy must find fresh impetus in the Union’s future budgets, while the fundamental pillars of the cohesion policy and the agricultural policy should continue to receive the current amount of funding.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe and its big projects clash with budgetary constraints at national level, meaning that greater involvement of the private sector through project bonds or public/private partnerships is the key to raising competitiveness and growth.</p>

We have an enormous number of free days. The Commission’s officials have up to 13 weeks paid leave. Commissioner, I would suggest that you take some of these free days and reallocate them to the implementation of the budget, so that we can actually achieve the political goals we want to achieve.

      <p sl="pl">I am very pleased that MEPs have decided to support the amendment I tabled regarding the strengthening of policies on youth. At a time when young Europeans are some of the main victims of the economic crisis, we should support all initiatives aimed at improving the situation of young people and, in particular, those aimed at improving access to education and their professional situation. Programmes such as ‘Youth in Action’ and ‘Lifelong Learning’, which have a very low cost per beneficiary and are extremely effective, should therefore be maintained as a separate element of future multiannual financial frameworks, and these programmes also deserve significantly more funding.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the debate will also be strongly influenced by the debates on own resources. One of the issues which has poisoned the debate is the decision on the British rebate taken in 1984. How has it been able to continue for so long? I think that either the British Government should not be entitled to any rebate at all or that other countries which find themselves in a similar situation to that which Great Britain was in in 1984 should be treated the same. I hope that the Commission proposals will, in fact, move in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this obsession with focusing only on the quantity of the cuts to be made and not on how or what to cut, and even less on how to increase revenue, is already a cause for concern.</p>

In this regard, it seems to me that the budget is not sufficiently coordinated with the ambitious goals included in the EU 2020 programme. I also have a question: you, Commissioner, promised Latvian farmers that direct payments would be evened out with this budget.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thought the EU could not get any worse and then I came across this report. It starts with a hefty helping of self-delusion: ‘never have Europeans been more demanding of the EU’. Well, increasing numbers of British people are demanding that we come out of it. Perhaps that is what they mean. It dismisses utterly the idea of freezing the budget after 2013 and insists that even an increase of 5% would allow only a limited contribution to the EU’s objectives. Well, we must be thankful for small mercies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tucked away in the middle of paragraph 166 is a call for an end to rebates. This is the device by which the United Kingdom pays only an unacceptable net contribution instead of an outrageous net contribution. Insisting that the UK should pay over its hard-earned money is bad enough, but paragraph 169 suggests that the EU should have the power to levy its own taxes without our consent and without our control. That is simply unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we have achieved an important consensus. The report that has been presented is a necessary continuation of what has gone before, while also proposing the expected changes. Stability is a characteristic feature of EU policies, hence, the proposal to maintain the current budget for cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Levelling the playing field in terms of development contributes significantly to strengthening the common market, which yields positive outcomes for all EU Member States. The common agricultural policy benefits every consumer in the EU. It is worth bearing in mind that farmers have very low incomes, in spite of the support they receive from the European budget. The new tasks with which agriculture has been faced in respect of the environment, the climate, animal welfare and unrealistic WTO negotiations mean additional costs for farmers. Who will pay? The changes that we expect include an increase in funding for sustainable and smart development, and an emphasis on innovation, scientific research and education.</p>

      <p sl="es">I feel that this is not a debate on budget volume, but rather on the supremacy of the Community method, and I think that those who have focused this debate on efforts to reduce the Union budget have made a mistake. They want new priorities and a reduced budget; I say to them that going down this route will mean that they end up with a reduced budget and fewer priorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">I certainly do not understand how they can sit in this hemicycle and defend an intergovernmental approach. Leave that step to the Council; you should defend a European Union, with its policies, priorities, responsibilities, and an adequate budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">We do not want an increase of 5% in European public spending; instead, we are seeking to alleviate national budgetary burdens and gather certain transnational investments into the EU budget, where they can be more efficiently utilised. That is the European added value that all groups in this Chamber accepted in the Policy Challenges (SURE) Committee this year.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think this is certainly a far-reaching proposal; it is an ambitious proposal and requires important decisions to be made in the Member States, and we would ask them to rise to the challenge it entails.</p>

Consequently, the positive and negative impact on the climate and environment and the use of EU funds should be analysed at every level.

      <p sl="cs">The continuing debate on the forthcoming programming period shows us that it will be necessary to focus to a greater extent this time on a more comprehensive approach to this primary economic instrument for EU policies. The global financial crisis and the intense global competitive pressures from the economic tigers of China and India show us that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will have to be set up in such a way that it corresponds to the main objectives of the 2020 agenda. The rapporteur’s idea of merging all policies relating to the 2020 agenda into the single area of the MFF looks extremely bold. The rapporteur is quite right to propose a legally binding review of the limits in individual areas half way through the programming period. Also of interest is the idea of bringing the timing of the MMF into line with the political cycles of EU bodies, thereby increasing democratic control and accountability. The rapporteur’s idea that we must consider reforming EU revenues is undoubtedly correct in principle. It is also entirely appropriate to move across gradually to a system of own resources for the EU, thereby replacing the current system of Member State contributions, as this leads to comparisons of the balance between the EU and Member States, causing the general public to draw the wrong conclusions over the meaning of EU membership, which is an entirely mistaken conclusion given the current interconnectedness of economies and policies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Garriga Polledo’s report sets out to define the European Parliament’s political priorities for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period after 2013, both in terms of legislation and the budget. Two elements in particular caught my eye: firstly, that cohesion for growth and employment is a political priority. I fully support the creation of an intermediate region category. This would apply to all regions where GDP per capita falls between 75% and 90% of EU GDP. This would serve to create a better balance between regions. The proposal puts into practice the principle of territorial cohesion as set out in Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. On the subject of the financial perspectives, I am in favour of taxing financial transactions so as to build up own resources for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to draw attention to the proposal in this report for a financial transaction tax (FTT). A financial transaction tax could deal with two problems at once – how to finance ever-growing demands to put new EU policies in place, and how to make the financial sector contribute to the resolution of the economic crisis that it helped to cause. The tax revenues could moderate payments EU Member States currently make to the EU budget. At the same time, they will allow the smooth development of policies to safeguard the economic future of Europe. We would have the resources for investment in research and development, fighting climate change and in building solidarity between the regions of the EU. Europe should lead the world by levying this tax within its borders and campaigning for it to be introduced in the rest of the world.

      <p sl="pt">Let us look at the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The EU’s expansion to 12 new countries, generally with lower levels of development than the average for the 15 previous Member States, has brought undeniable challenges and demands in terms of realising the principle of economic and social cohesion. However, what we have seen is a relative cut in the Structural Funds from 0.42% to 0.37% of EU gross national income (GNI). In other words: they have been cut in relative terms at the time they were most needed. The results are plain to see: instead of the promised convergence, what we have is a visible divergence, exacerbated by the effects of the economic and social crisis, and by the functioning and development of instruments like the Single Market, to the benefit of some and to the clear detriment of others. This is the MFF now serving as a benchmark for the debate on the financial perspectives 2013-2020, with the proposal being, essentially, to maintain it. The 5% increase will not raise the EU budget substantially above 1% of Union GNI. Once again, this is threatening the heralded principle of cohesion. This is made even worse by the fact that available resources are now channelled into other purposes – included, nonetheless, in the Treaties: militarism and overseas intervention, amongst others – that make this principle even more secondary in nature.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Although there were grounds for freezing EU expenditure during the economic crisis, we cannot use the same arguments that we did two years ago when considering the Multiannual Financial Framework today. Instead, we must ask ourselves questions regarding the principles governing the EU’s functioning in the next seven-year period: is it to be an EU based on solidarity, which fulfils its obligations and establishes an innovative economy and a common foreign policy in line with the Treaty of Lisbon? Or is it instead to be an EU which did admittedly include ambitious objectives in the Treaty, but which everyone knows was only playing make-believe? I am a staunch advocate of the former, and I support the rapporteur’s opinion as regards the need to increase funding in the next Multiannual Financial Framework by 5% compared to 2013 levels. This change would bring us closer to achieving the ambitious goals enshrined in the Treaty, and a 5% increase in expenditure would actually mean a very small increase, since inflation currently stands at 3.2%. Furthermore, this insignificant increase in the EU budget will benefit the poorest regions, which gain most from EU assistance granted in order to ensure that differences in development are overcome. I hope that the next Presidency, which will be held by Poland, will make it a priority to reconcile the positions of the ‘net payers’, such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom, with Parliament’s position, as set out in the ambitious Garriga Polledo report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In the past, MEPs had only limited influence in talks on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) of the Union. The fundamental change ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon applies precisely to this long-term programming of the budget, which must be compiled afresh by the Council after approval by the European Parliament. This was the reason for establishing the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE), which defines in its report the political priorities of the European Parliament ahead of the start of talks on the next MFF following 2013. It is clear from the report of Salvador Garriga Polledo that adequate funding will have to be secured for EU policies if the Union still wants to focus on achieving the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Without sufficient new resources after 2013, the Union will be unable to fulfil either the current political priorities or the new tasks and objectives from the Europe 2020 strategy. In view of the inadequacy of the EU’s traditional own resources, a specialist discussion was started in the SURE committee on new own resources for the EU budget. We have a great opportunity in the next financial framework to show European citizens that the Union is capable of thinking and acting in their long-term interest, and achieving effective results in securing internal cohesion and solid growth. I therefore entirely agree with the rapporteur’s priority statement that the sums earmarked for the common agricultural policy and the cohesion policy in the next period must not be lower than in the current framework.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The draft proposal, which was supported by eight committees, starts out from challenges to which the new Multiannual Financial Framework has to respond as well. The current crisis is the last warning for Europe to react to the transformation in world order. Like all transformations, the emerging order will produce winners and losers. Europe shall not be among the losers. Jean Monnet warned in his time: ‘Europe has never existed. One must genuinely create Europe’. The founding father of European integration did not regard this task as a single act, but as continuous work. Accordingly, we must assess expected conditions and specific circumstances and determine what we have to do to make sure that Europe exists and does not end up as a loser. The Commission submitted the Europe 2020 strategy last year, whose aim is recovery from the crisis and the preparation of the European economy for the next decade. The three key areas that promote economic growth are the following: knowledge, innovation, education; or ‘intelligent growth’ that puts digital society in the centre, sustainable development that promotes more efficient energy use and enhances competitiveness, and inclusive growth that increases participation in the labour market. The new Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union must be established at Community level and national development programmes should be adjusted to each other in a way that they result in an optimal implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy by creating the necessary synergies.</p>

      <p sl="fi">People expect concrete results from the EU more than ever during economically difficult times. We need better, simpler legislation which serves the interests of Europeans. Regulation needs to be pruned. There is no reason to draft European legislation unless there is a real need for it. The EU’s forthcoming budget should respond more effectively to the day-to-day problems faced by the public. The budget should support growth and new jobs, but, above all, it should create European added value.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At the end of this month, the Commission is to publish its proposals for the EU’s budget after 2014. With the economic crisis, the Member States of the EU have had to make tough decisions with respect to their own budgets. In times of crisis, the EU’s budget should not be increased either. On the contrary, it should be cut.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I hope that, ultimately, we will rid ourselves of much of the foolishness that is associated with the EU. Parliament’s monthly trek between Brussels and Strasbourg costs European taxpayers a good EUR 200 million a year. This money can be put to better use. The various discounts that are granted to the United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany should be abolished altogether. This year, the United Kingdom alone will receive a rebate of some EUR 3 billion because of a discount on contributions negotiated in 1984.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is time the EU and its budget were reformed. The money that European taxpayers provide has to be used more effectively and bring European added value to the Member States. An increase in administration, red tape and unnecessary EU legislation does not represent that.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The new Multiannual Financial Framework is extremely significant because the European Union’s future will, to a great extent, depend on it. The debate on the financial perspective is not an easy one because many Member States are feeling the effects of the economic crisis. Their reluctance to increase the EU budget is quite understandable. Nevertheless, the financial sceptics should be aware of the extent of the benefits the common market confers upon the individual Member States’ economies. European integration has a positive and stimulating influence on the economy. In addition, the European Parliament would like the new financial framework to be structured in such a way as to increase competitiveness and promote social integration. The EU budget funds measures which are absolutely vital for the citizens of all the Member States. This is not an abstract statement. Cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy have an impact on the daily lives of millions of citizens. There can be no doubt that some of the tasks performed by the EU would not be carried out by any other body. Increasing the level of social, economic and infrastructure cohesion or ensuring equality of opportunity in the agricultural sector are objectives which deserve our support. It is worth spending European money on them. The European Union cannot carry out more measures in more Member States with a smaller budget. This is not feasible, and this is why we need a larger and ambitious budget.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As the rapporteur writes, European Union assistance is essential if the Member States are to be in a position to meet future challenges. The Europe 2020 strategy indicates the appropriate areas where this assistance should be focused, by outlining the priorities and vision of a strong, stable and modern Europe; a Europe which will have learnt its lesson from its recent economic problems and a Europe which will ensure jobs, energy security and healthy food for its citizens. Budgetary plans should take account of the most important objectives of sustainable development, at the same time as being flexible and focused on concrete measures. I barely need mention the fact that money must be spent transparently and for good reason. Public acceptance and understanding are nowadays an integral part of EU policy and form the basis for the EU’s functioning.</p>

      <p sl="en">To achieve the 2020 goals, a European approach is needed. At the same time, one has to realise that more Europe cannot be achieved with less money. Freezing the resources by Member States will not be a sustainable option. Once Member States have accepted long-term strategic all-European political commitments, it is not possible to deny them financing. This will only undermine the EU’s credibility in the eyes of millions of citizens. In practical terms, much better coordination of the programmes is required, concentrating on their complementarities. Financing the new priorities – R&amp;D, innovation, and energy and transportation networks – will be unrealistic while retaining the present level of resources. The real internal EU challenge is to make the older EU15 and younger EU12 meet at the end of the next financial framework. Continuing with old programmes and designing new programmes has to be given in-depth scrutiny. Commitment to the EU’s principles of equality and solidarity should end the existence of different standards and also prejudices in decision making. The EU can succeed when all its Members are treated by the same standards. A true financial perspective has to look even further forward than seven years. However, I support flexible mechanisms for necessary adaptations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Union’s poorest regions are developing rapidly at present, and one of the reasons for this is European funding. Although many new roads have been built or repaired and Internet connections have been installed, there are still a great many needs to be met, since there is a very large gap between these regions and the most highly developed regions. When we joined the European Union, there were fears that Poland and the new Member States would not make proper use of the opportunities afforded to them by membership, and that European funds would be spent without due consideration. Fears were also voiced regarding corruption, since opportunity – or a great deal of money – makes the thief. Meanwhile, analyses have shown that European money has been spent wisely in Poland, and has not been linked with dishonest practices. Therefore, in view of the gap we are trying to bridge and, at the same time, the EU’s future goals, we must not reduce either the EU budget or the funds for implementing cohesion policy. Even if the European Parliament votes through an increase to the European budget, which I hope will be the case, it is now important to convince the individual Member States that it is worth supporting Parliament’s political position.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr Garriga Polledo for having prepared a comprehensive report, and for the impressive amount of work he has put into drafting compromise amendments. I agree with the rapporteur that cohesion policy, which has proven its effectiveness, should be given a place in the new Multiannual Financial Framework which is commensurate with its importance. However, we should strive for better coordination and complementarity of the individual funds, and for simplified procedures. Changes to systems for monitoring and managing funds, aimed at increasing the effectiveness of their interventions, should be based on a thorough analysis of their current functioning. I also support the view that unused funds should remain in the budget earmarked for cohesion, and not returned to the Member States, and I believe that we need a thorough analysis of the possible consequences of including the European Development Fund in the EU budget, in particular, in light of the EU’s obligations to third countries.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Europe is experiencing a crisis. The tax shortfalls of self-governing regions exceed 20% of the budget, compared to the period before the crisis, which is unsustainable. The revenue shortfalls for municipalities look very similar. They cannot fund their core competences, they are laying off employees and they are getting into debt.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In such a situation, we should not be surprised that they fail to understand why the European Parliament is asking for more resources.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, if states coordinated their policies and funding in the area of priorities, they would achieve better results and would save more funds than the amount by which we want to increase the common EU budget. There is therefore no better alternative than the one we are discussing today.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must discuss it and debate it more, not only in the European Parliament, but especially with ministers in the Council, with members of national parliaments, and also in the regions, so that they understand that a joint solution will bring not only the best result for our citizens, but will also lead to savings in national budgets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors find themselves not just paying the EU budget through the huge redistribution mechanism, but actually paying two and three times over. In future years, real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees. This will have to be financed by the net contributors, in other words, the hard-working German, French, Italian, Dutch and Austrian citizens, from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries. The people in the economically strong EU countries are angry – at least every bit as angry as the demonstrators in Athens – because they have to tighten their belts for the sake of the PIIG states. Demanding budget increases in this difficult situation is out-of-touch and scandalous. We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors. Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings. Farming subsidies, the largest and most contentious budgetary factor, should be renationalised. This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector. If the enormous amount of money paid in taxes were to reach small and medium-sized farmers instead of big landowners, agricultural factories, large businesses, monarchs and golf clubs, then maybe it would be possible to halt the decline in farming.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The adoption of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo marks an import step for this House: it constitutes a clear, pragmatic and realistic statement of the European Parliament’s budgetary ambitions post-2013. Firstly, on cohesion policy, which is key to regional development. I believe that we need to maintain the cohesion policy budget and create an equitable aid model for all regions with intermediary income so as to make future EU investments in the regions transparent and fair. The 5% budget increase is reasonable. It is not, as the Eurosceptics claim, an example of European profligacy, but rather a courageous admission that if we do not give ourselves the means to build Europe together, we will remain isolated and powerless. Consequently, so as to be able to finance the actions linked to the EU’s new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon, I am supporting the request for the question of own resources to be examined and for new forms of Community income, in order to ease the pressure on national budgets and to do away with the belief in a ‘fair return’ which is economically inaccurate and politically unsound.</p>

I should stress in particular that the development of a competitive agricultural sector and economic and social cohesion should be maintained as priorities for the period ahead.

Now we have to declare loud and clear that these objectives can only be achieved if we assign sufficient resources to them. In a period when many Member States are suffering from the ‘Mediterranean dilemma’, whereby the country needs fiscal expansion in order to stimulate growth, but it cannot be done because never-ending austerity measures would be inevitable due to the country’s indebtedness, we cannot respond by decreasing or approving the current EU budget that is fundamentally aimed at development. We cannot, because it would mean depriving regions lagging behind of their only chance to put their economies on a path to growth.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Galliga Polledo report devotes much attention to the Europe 2020 programme. I believe that earmarking significant amounts of money for the objectives of this programme may result in a drop in funding for programmes which are important for European cohesion and development, such as the cohesion fund. The outcomes show that this fund has been the most effective tool to date for accomplishing the goals enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Lisbon. It is therefore important for its funding to be increased. Many European countries have been severely affected by the economic crisis and for them, the cohesion fund is now a driving force making it possible to fight unemployment proactively and to mobilise regions. On the other hand, it is important for the EU to provide financial support for energy projects and innovation. These two areas of investment are the key to the rapid growth of the European Union. At present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the EU, mainly Russia. This entails significant capital outflow beyond our borders, and we should therefore earmark more funds for supporting infrastructure investments which allow for a diversification of supply and a subsequent drop in prices, including the Nabucco pipeline, which is the most important project in terms of diversification. The report also fails to set out any clear guidelines regarding support for shale gas exploration in the near future. The EU must not forget that making wise investments today in sources of energy will mean capital savings tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="fi">One thing I agreed to here, for the sake of compromise, was that the money that is being charged here for heavy goods traffic can be spent on rail transport or shipping.

We are on the periphery of Europe, with two sea bridges to mainland Europe where all of these extra charges for road use and pollution are going to apply. I understand from the exporters’ association in Ireland that this would add EUR 150 per trip, or EUR 300 per round trip, for haulage from Ireland, which depends heavily on this type of haulage and also very heavily on exports. This will ensure that we will be less competitive.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would have liked to support this particular measure but I had to vote against because, as has been said already by my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, Ireland’s economy is heavily dependent on exports. The Eurovignette measures, if adopted in our country, would have devastating consequences. Any additional charges on Irish hauliers would have a major negative impact on our exports. I think I am supported by the Spanish, the Portuguese and also the Italians. We are peripheral nations. We are totally dependent on our international markets.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the European Union in 2007, yet both countries still carry out border checks as a result of the partial application of the measures contained in the acquis. As careful assessments and visits carried out by groups of experts have shown, even though the two countries have shown substantial commitment and made obvious progress in implementing the acquis, some shortcomings still remain, for example, in the fields of equipment, performance of border checks and training.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are of a mind to confirm our support for their full adhesion to the agreement, although we think it is essential for the two countries in question to inform us in writing, within six months, that additional measures to close these gaps have been implemented. Indeed, the fact that the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area is one of the most sensitive regions for the Union’s border policy in terms of illegal migration is something we cannot ignore or fail to consider.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, the most important part of this very well drafted report from Mr Coelho was at the end. This is where there was a very clear mention about the danger from the emigration wave which may inundate Europe from Turkey and, through Turkey, from the countries in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Up to a quarter of a century ago, Europe was protected from such emigration waves for two reasons: the Iron Curtain and the totalitarian regimes in North Africa. Both totalitarian systems kept their citizens under submission and were more likely not to allow them to leave their country than the opposite, but these obstacles do not exist now.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why I voted for this report. I welcome the fact that Mr Coelho has mentioned the significance of the emigration pressure from Turkey on Bulgaria and Greece. However, I wish to say that it will not be enough for these statements just to remain words on a piece of paper. Resources and programmes are needed, which will be used to protect the Union from this emigration wave.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, it is obviously very important that in the European Union, the same principles can be applied to all the Member States of the Union. In this respect, the Schengen Agreement is one step forward towards this kind of closer cooperation, that is to say, freer movement, but we must obviously remember that free movement also has to involve a certain sense of responsibility. Now we must hope that, when Romania and Bulgaria join the Schengen area, the problems that have occurred on their borders are actually addressed, and that adequate resources are channelled there to ensure that this sort of illegal migration and the other occurrences can be prevented.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Of course, basically the situation is that there cannot be a two-tier system in the European Union: the same rules have to apply to everyone. In this way, we can also ensure that the same opportunities are pursued in these countries as elsewhere. Resources are needed, because we know the problems and dangers that are occurring there.</p>

However, in this case, I believe it is our business; we know that Bulgaria and Romania have serious problems with crime and corruption and I do not believe that their border controls are as good as those which would obtain in other Schengen countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">They will therefore become a route and a conduit for illegal immigrants into the European Union who, within the Schengen area, would then be free to come to Calais and would definitely have the effect of increasing illegal immigration into the United Kingdom.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme is especially significant.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are four reasons – which I consider to be paramount – why I voted in favour of the report: 1) the simplification and streamlining of procedures in order to make it easier to access funding; 2) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for growth and employment; 3) innovation for a competitive manufacturing sector capable of meeting the challenges of the market; and 4) the risk finance facility, which so far has produced very good results.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, there is broad consensus in Parliament on the need to reform our research programme. Nevertheless, I have to express my regret that the Commission has been so vague and unambitious in its mid-term review. It could, in fact, be made very much better and much more could be done immediately. The Commission could reduce the application deadlines, secure funds for demonstration facilities and use international accounting standards instead of inventing its own. All of this creates pointless bureaucracy that frightens industry away. It prevents Europe from progressing from ideas to invoices. In future, therefore, we must reduce the chaotic jumble of programmes and the amount of bureaucracy, and we must focus on the major challenges: climate change, energy and food – in short, we must use our research to create jobs. Parliament has today shown that it has the will to do this. Now it is up to the Commission to show the way.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, research and innovation play a central role in the European Union’s development and competitiveness and they are crucial in terms of reaching the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Seventh Framework Programme is the main instrument for funding research in Europe, as shown by the report voted on today. However, there are still many problems being caused by excessive amounts of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
      <p sl="it">In its resolution of 11 November 2010, Parliament asked the Commission to introduce procedural, administrative and financial simplification measures into the current management of the Seventh Framework Programme, yet these measures have still not been addressed. I call upon the Commission to acknowledge Parliament’s observations and to identify solutions to make it easier for SMEs to access the seventh and eighth research programmes.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I was also happy to vote in favour of this report, and I thank my colleague, Mr Audy, for doing such a good job. I have two matters to raise. Funding is extremely important, and it could be a little more ambitious, since it is being stated here that this level is credible and necessary. We have to increase funding to achieve vital growth in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Some time ago, I myself was listening to a Finnish research group which was receiving funding through this programme. They do cell research, in which they are quite close to a breakthrough which would even allow them to develop cures for cancer. They have had no information, however, as to whether the funding will continue. They are quite at a loss. In my opinion, this funding should be continued and it should be sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The other issue, on which we are clearly receiving feedback, is that a lot of working time is spent on red tape. This needs to be cut, so that things can be prioritised properly.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I am pleased that today, we are discussing the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme. Many of the points mentioned in the document are very true, particularly as regards young researchers and more active participation by industry in projects under the Framework Programme. The document expresses concern over the rather low participation rate among certain Member States. I would like to draw attention to the fact that there are objective reasons for this. The financing schemes in force today are, in a sense, more favourable towards the old European Union Member States. This is also reflected in the figures. The amount of financing that a project participant from one of the new Member States receives is half what it would be for a participant from the old Member States. As a result of this situation, a gap is forming in the Community and new Member States are being excluded, which I firmly believe is wrong. I therefore feel that it is necessary to review the financing schemes and to strive to ensure during FP8 that there are no more disparities or discrimination, so that we can successfully address the challenges mentioned in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the current Seventh Framework Programme ensures that the European Union can raise its research policy to an adequate level. With its budget in excess of EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, we can consider it as one of the most significant programmes supporting research in the world. We need to prepare a mid-term review based on concrete data in order to ensure that the Seventh Framework Programme continues to meet European requirements. I believe that the simplification process is the most important thing we can underline in a mid-term review. Experience also shows that the complexity and difficulty of administrative procedures was one of the biggest problems for our researchers. The other important thing is the facilitation of the participation of SMEs in the programme. Unfortunately, in this respect, we need to make further efforts, although some improvement has been achieved in programmes concerning cooperation. We were very pleased to welcome the introduction of the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility. This should be continued and increased until the end of the Seventh Framework Programme, and in the course of subsequent programmes. For these reasons, I voted in favour of the report.</p>

I do not agree with the statement that the project, which is being carried out at the well-known AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, violates the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Its research goal is, after all, to accomplish the goals set out in resolutions on the fight against paedophilia, sales of weapons via the Internet and the fight against drug trafficking and human trafficking, which are issues we have raised many times in this Chamber. It is an innovative project, which does an excellent job of filling the gaps in the EU Member States’ security systems, particularly as regards the Internet. The people it affects are those who break the law, and they are the ones who have most to fear from its goals. What is more, the project provides a good basis for the construction of an integrated security network, ensuring defence against cyber attacks. Russia, the United States and China have put in place similar solutions, and we have been eagerly awaiting them for several years at EU level. I do not therefore understand why funding for the entire project is being withheld, all the more so since this is the only project which the Audy report singles out in this way.</p>

These cells, since they represent the first stage of the human life they will become, must be legally defined as embryos, the patenting of which must be ruled out.

The impact assessment for the EU-Canada agreement indicates clear benefits for both sides. Sector-specific analyses are simply a way of looking for a reason to say no, because the truth is there will always be both winners and losers. It is our responsibility to do what is best for the majority. Free trade is best for consumers as it provides greater choice and lower prices. It is best for businesses because it extends their market and creates growth and jobs. Free trade is the international division of labour, ensuring that we all do what we are best at, while allowing everyone else to do what they are best at.</p>

A guarantee of the implementation of this principle should also be contained in the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which is likely to be reviewed in the near future. I am pleased that the proposals in the Committee on the Environment, for which I provided amendments, concern environmental impact assessments, which really is crucially important. The European Commission must also play a more active role in defending the interests of the European Union and its Member States in cases where projects being undertaken by third countries may have an impact on the European Union or on one or several of its Member States.

It is all well and good that we can presumably all agree only to enter into free trade agreements and partnerships with countries that respect human rights. That is actually already in the Treaty. However, I think some politicians have forgotten what CSR stands for. It stands for corporate social responsibility. Thus, it is a question of what enterprises do on their own account over and above complying with the legislation. This is used as a competitive parameter in business, thus creating a drive for enterprises themselves to keep on improving this aspect of their business. If we come along and steal this away and turn it into political legislation, we completely remove this competitive parameter, and that – if I may say so – is sheer political stupidity.</p>

Even though both the Treaty of Lisbon and the Europe 2020 strategy attributed an unprecedented level of importance to social policy, the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, it is becoming ever clearer that we need to stop concentrating strictly on the markets and instead take a more holistic interest in people, which means protecting them, the rights of workers and the right to work.

In the age of social media, it is difficult to hide information from consumers on a company’s practices abroad.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, 2011 offers a strategic opportunity to draw the lessons from the four years that the regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation has been in force. Since its entry into force, the main problem which has emerged seems to be the difficulty in understanding or accepting the specific role of development cooperation in the context of the European Union’s external action.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need to clarify the fact that development cooperation is the one policy area of external action, besides humanitarian aid, which has not been designed to serve EU interests, but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations on this planet.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite the fact that the European Parliament has repeatedly acknowledged the advantages that would be conferred upon the Internal Market by improvements to the framework of contract law, the introduction of a new system of contract law using an optional instrument has encountered a series of major problems, in terms of both substance and procedure. Above all, the proposals put forward reflect the Commission’s position, which is not supported by the substance of public debate. We do not know the positions held by the individual Member States, or those held by consumer and business representatives. Diverging legal interpretations may result from the lack of clarity of some of the proposed documents, which will be used as a basis for judicial decisions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in today’s strongly globalised economy. As far as education and vocational training are concerned, the key factors listed in the European strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level and in the Member States. The projections suggest that the demand for skills will continue to rise. Industrial and technological change increases the need for workers with high and intermediate skill levels, but low-skilled labour is, conversely, being squeezed out.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, especially where young people are concerned, action needs to be taken quickly: the continuing rise in youth unemployment is one of the most important challenges facing Europe.

Youth unemployment is serious when young people have no access to work of any kind because they are poorly educated or lack work experience, nor are young people lacking in a proper education or work experience in a strong position when competing for jobs. That is why we have to focus our energy on providing wide-ranging, high-quality education and, furthermore, pay attention to the perspective of gender, so that the underlying causes of youth unemployment can be eliminated. We should also remember the role of further training because it is that which promotes lifelong learning and prepares people for changes in the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, it is highly significant that Parliament is using this resolution to send a strong message to both the Member States and the younger generations to ask for greater commitment to European cooperation on learning, vocational training and higher education in order to bolster the Europe 2020 strategy. We know that youth unemployment has severe repercussions on poverty and social exclusion, as does the prolonged period of insecurity in which 40% of European young people live.</p>
      <p sl="it">Strong backing should be given to a combination of education policies and a new incentive-based welfare system for enterprises that provide full-time employment for young people and women. Ensuring that the skills being learned are in line with the competences – including for citizenship – required for the new goals of sustainable and intelligent growth is essential, as are policies for the transition from education to the workplace and speeding up the recognition of professional qualifications, titles and academic credits.</p>
      <p sl="it">Those Member States which, like my own, are cutting resources for education and research at a time of crisis must know that they are hurting young people, and hurting the future of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, I was involved in the preparation of the report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and indeed, unemployment in Europe is high, but unemployment among the young is, on average, twice as high. There are Member States in which the figure is even higher, such as my home country, where it is actually three times higher. I support the initiatives in the report as practical steps to turn this situation around towards improvement. We do not see the sense in training a large number of people who have been in higher education but who then do not find any use for it in the labour market. We must concentrate more on vocational training and retraining.</p>
      <p sl="et">What is completely unacceptable, however, is the action taken by the Council on education in terms of budget cuts. Their actions are also incompatible with the fulfilment of the Europe 2020 strategy, which has already been adopted. They are not putting their money where their mouth is. I voted for the adoption of the report. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I also voted in favour of this report, especially since it is estimated that there will be 15 million jobs available to people who have tertiary qualifications between now and 2020. At the same time, it is estimated that there will be 12 million fewer jobs for people who have no qualification or a very poor one. Therefore, something must be done about this and there is evidently a great need for education and training. Twenty-one per cent of young people across Europe are out of work and it is therefore important that they remain in education until they, too, have a suitable qualification and that there be collaboration between colleges and business so that those qualifications are suitable. In addition, it is important that there be independent evaluation of those qualifications. If all those things are done, we can solve this problem in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important piece of work that allows us to set out a new financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need a budget that is designed for the challenges of the present day and that can provide a strong and innovative response to current needs. Its top priority must be research and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, to stimulate growth and employment, while the second objective is to reform the common agricultural policy in order to promote and support the competitiveness of agriculture in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, particular attention should be paid to the future of the cohesion policy, which I consider to be a very important instrument and one which provides financial support for investments that drive economic growth and, above all, the creation of new jobs. On this subject, I would like to revisit a point that I think is particularly important: the establishment of a new intermediate category. I believe, of course, that this new category cannot be created by siphoning off resources from existing ones, which are essential for supporting the balanced, harmonious and sustainable growth of our communities.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this extremely important report was adopted, and I would like to mention just a few details. The first is Amendment 18, tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which states that some fairly precise cuts can be made under the common agricultural policy, according to the kinds of current reforms that exist. In other words, we get a clear picture of the ALDE Group’s view of agricultural policy, although it has been worded very cleverly. The obvious and basic premise here is that agricultural policy is what is to be cut, if we have to cut anything.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The other important point, on which I voted differently from my group, was Amendment 37d, which originally points to the significant savings that could be made if the European Parliament were to have a single seat. There is no point arguing about that: savings will be made. It does not make any difference, no matter how we vote: we know that savings will be made. I would hope that here at long last, people understand that the public is really tired of savings being made that concern them but not savings that concern us. This cannot be explained away to the public and nothing will be improved by voting on it. Savings will be made and we have to make them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the Union because, at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so-called European spirit, I am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the Union with credible instruments, beginning with adequate funding.</p>
      <p sl="it">The request for a 5% increase in the next budget is therefore just and necessary. Perhaps it will not be enough, but it is essential in order to provide answers to the big questions that lie ahead: these resources are needed to tackle real problems, such as greater cohesion between the regions, a greater capacity for research and innovation, and a greater capacity to generate growth and provide jobs. Without adequate resources, none of these problems will be properly dealt with, beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy, which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why I voted in favour and I hope that the Commission and the Council will follow the recommendations of the report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the economic crisis, demographic problems and growing unemployment are having a significant impact on the budgetary constraints of the Member States. A European budget providing opportunities for long-term planning should therefore be a tool which promotes the growth of the individual countries’ economies. The Europe 2020 strategy, which stimulates job creation and promotes social integration, is, to my mind, a key component in helping countries exit the crisis. In this context, it is particularly important for its scope to cover small and medium-sized enterprises as well. I therefore agree with the proposal to ensure greater support for all programmes and instruments supporting these businesses, including programmes aimed at competitiveness, innovation and use of the Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Maintaining competitiveness, increasing economic growth and fighting unemployment will be the greatest challenges faced by the EU.

      <p sl="it">I do have one doubt, which we have expressed by voting to adopt the amendment removing the wording on the creation of an intermediate category for cohesion policies in those parts of Europe where gross domestic product (GDP) falls to between 75% and 90% of EU GDP. This really concerns us, not because we do not believe that the focus of the cohesion policy should be extended, but because we think that without additional resources, this extension risks depriving and reducing the resources for the areas referred to in Objective 1 – the so-called convergence objective – which need just as much attention and support from the European Union. To sum up, I am pleased with the report and I am pleased with the work that has been done, but I have some concerns about the attention that we seem to have paid to a policy that could have confirmed the so-called ‘facing-out’, as we are used to seeing.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the contents of the new Multiannual Financial Framework must present a clear vision of the future of the Union and its citizens. The current economic and social challenges that we face need to be reflected not only in impressive speeches but, first and foremost, in concrete budget chapters.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Whether we look at the current difficulties and ambitions of the EU and its regions from a regional or a global perspective, the most pressing issues remain the energy shortage, the slowdown in economic growth and unemployment. We must therefore still regard the development and innovation of European energy infrastructure as priority areas that need considerably more funding. In my opinion, a return to coal-burning is not, in the current environmental context, a solution for the future or for the creation of a fully-fledged trans-European transport network. These two areas are an essential precondition for developing the competitiveness of the EU as a whole and for the operation of the Internal Market and, as such, they deserve particular attention when drafting the budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly, I welcome the commitment in the report to at least maintaining the CAP and cohesion funding at present levels in the next perspective. There was much controversy in our group as well about the intermediate category, and it was decided to have a free vote. It does not affect my colleagues in Ireland or ourselves at all because even though we are in the IMF – and we are broke as a country – we are well above the European average in GDP terms; so whether there is an intermediate category or not does not affect us.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we do think that there is a need for a fundamental appraisal of cohesion policy going forward because, as more and more regions go above the 75% threshold, the policy is either going to become redundant or be reformed, and that is what we expect to happen.</p>

Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus only partially apply the Schengen acquis at the moment and checks are therefore still carried out at the borders with these three Member States. Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the EU in 2007. Taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by teams of experts, the European Parliament and the Council have concluded that, although there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up, they do not constitute an obstacle to full Schengen membership for these two Member States.

Notwithstanding the generally positive judgment on the progress made by these two Member States in terms of security, the report itself admits that numerous technical and administrative shortcomings were detected in the bodies tasked with ensuring the border security of both States and, in particular, in the bodies tasked with checking and monitoring sea and land borders. Secondly, the report acknowledges that if the two countries were included in the Schengen area, their geographical position next to the Turkish border would create two new routes for illegal migrants who currently only head for Greece, which, at this precise moment, is the only Schengen State in the Balkan peninsula.</p>

The opinion of Parliament in Brussels is advisory and now, as in the past, the decision lies in the hands of the Council’s politicians. Applying double standards and talking about mandatory criteria which, once they have been met, are regarded as ‘only technical’ is not at all characteristic of a democratic, fair Union, as we know it. This is why I can only hope that the opinions of the experts and those of the European legislative will not continue to be ignored by politicians from Member States. Hiding behind words without resolving the matter directly can no longer be an option when admission to the Schengen area has never been a political problem, but a technical one. The assessments of the independent experts and those of Parliament, which voted overwhelmingly in favour of Romania’s integration into Schengen, should count as a crucial factor in the European Council and, consequently, the procedure should be unblocked.</p>

President Barroso reminded us that ‘freedom of movement is to Europe what foundations are to a building’. Free movement is one of the Union’s greatest achievements. I am delighted that Parliament has approved Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area. Huge efforts have been made to guarantee border security: their fourth generation surveillance systems are far more impressive than our second generation models. Yet there are still barriers to the free movement of workers: firstly, legal and administrative obstacles that affect all aspects of citizens’ lives; secondly, social dumping: although Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guarantees equal treatment for workers, the work of the Committee on Petitions proves that the reality is quite different; thirdly, social protection, which varies from one country to the next and so does not encourage mobility.

      <p sl="ro">Today’s vote in the European Parliament has highlighted that Romania is ready to apply the Schengen acquis. According to the rapporteur Mr Coelho, all the shortcomings which were identified in the past have been successfully rectified by the Romanian authorities. Romania is capable of providing proper protection, whether at its air, sea or land borders. This is why I find it regrettable that there are still doubts about our readiness to apply the acquis and that some Member States continue to protect their so-called ‘national security’ by putting unjustified obstacles in the way of a Member State which has earned its right to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. The European Parliament has spoken today with one voice about fairness. For how much longer is the Council going to continue ignoring our position?</p>

      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur, who has been monitoring this area over several sessions of Parliament, believes that although there remain unresolved issues that justify regular monitoring, these do not constitute an obstacle to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area. Given his experience in this area, I believe I can safely endorse his evaluation, and his demands for external border security. The decision to open borders to these Member States will provide improved freedom of movement and, on a more practical level, will enable Bulgarians and Romanians to feel more integrated with a Union of which they are fully-fledged members.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I hope that the symbolism of the moment will also translate into greater fluidity of trade between countries, and into the handling of immigration and security issues in a more integrated way. The rapporteur rightly warns of the sensitivity of the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece region in terms of illegal immigration. I agree with him when he points to the need for Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area, and an approach to combating a potential sharp increase in migration pressure common to Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by our fellow Member, Mr Coelho, concerns the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania. The Schengen Agreement was concluded on 14 June 1985. By abolishing checks at the internal borders of signatory countries and creating a common area, it made the free movement of people and goods throughout the European Union possible. Given that Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis in 2007; that the documents show both Bulgaria and Romania are ready for EU accession from a technical point of view; that all the accession headings were met in March 2011; and that the delay in the adoption of the new Schengen evaluation system to minimise existing problems – I fear that insecurity will increase – cannot prevent the entry of these countries into the EU, I am voting in favour. Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done in drawing up this report, despite the obstacles the Council placed in the way of accessing certain documentation considered essential to achieving this.</p>

The decision to include these countries, which joined the EU in 2007, in the Schengen area will have to be taken unanimously in the Council by the governments of all the countries already belonging to Schengen. The rapporteur mentions the need for additional measures to be taken on the Bulgaria-Greece-Turkey border, which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration. The evaluation committee also invited Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, fearing migration flows from Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the EU in 2007. The basic condition for the Council to decide in favour of abolishing checks on internal borders with these Member States is to confirm, within the framework of the assessment procedures, whether the new Member States have fulfilled the necessary condition of applying all parts of the Schengen acquis: data protection, the Schengen Information System (SIS), air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas. In order that the European Parliament can clearly assess all the elements necessary for reaching an opinion on whether these two countries are ready to join the Schengen area, it is essential to have full access to the expert assessment reports on progress in the preparations of these two countries. In my opinion, however, Romania and Bulgaria have now proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner. At the same time, though, the situation must not be underestimated, and we must now think how to keep the situation under control following the full accession of these countries to Schengen.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I have nothing against our friends and neighbours in Bulgaria and Romania. However, I do have a number of grievances against the Schengen provisions. This appalling agreement was concluded on the sly and ratified one August back in the 1980s. It has brought nothing but trouble. Removing internal borders does not guarantee freedom of movement for European citizens; rather, it creates insecurity and produces unmanageable population and migration trends within the EU, both in the countries of origin and of destination. It also provides wonderful opportunities for illegal immigrants, who know that no matter where they enter Europe, they will be able to settle wherever they like: France is particularly hard hit. The problems of the Roma and Lampedusa that have often been cited in this House merely serve to illustrate the problem. I do not want Schengen to apply in my country, nor would I wish it on others. Member States should retain full control of their borders and, where applicable, work together to strengthen the ‘external’ borders.</p>

Both countries have met all the technical criteria laid down by the European Union. Consequently I fully support their full participation in the Schengen area. Member States cannot add new conditions (such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime) or change the rules at half-time.

I did not endorse this document because taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by teams of experts, the committee responsible has concluded that there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future. It should be taken into account that the area made up by Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece is one the most sensitive points in the EU’s external borders in terms of illegal migration. It is therefore essential for Bulgaria to adopt some additional measures, namely, to prepare a special plan containing actions to be implemented at the moment of entering Schengen and also a joint approach (between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria) in order to be able to respond to the possible increase in migration flows. I feel that the Member States concerned should be requested to inform the European Parliament and the Council, in writing in the course of a six-month period, beginning on the date of the entry into force of this decision, on the implementation of these additional measures and shortcomings.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mr Coelho’s report on the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania. Indeed, Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the European Union in 2007. According to Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession, verifying that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by new Member States is a precondition for the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal borders with those Member States. The assessments carried out show that both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner. I therefore support the rapporteur’s request. However, we cannot forget that the area in question is one of the most sensitive parts of the EU’s external borders in terms of illegal migration. This means that additional measures need to be adopted because, as we know, the abolition of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between Member States and also the existence of effective controls on external borders, since the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and efficiency with which each Member State carries out its external border checks.</p>

It is worth noting that the end of preparations for these countries to join the Schengen area coincides with the debate on the EU migration policy and the growing opposition of some of the countries in the Schengen area to plans for its expansion. It is worth emphasising the fact that Romania and Bulgaria have met almost all the requirements imposed upon them, in particular: land, air and sea border checks, the issuing of visas, police cooperation and data protection. We must also not forget that these are EU border countries, which are contending with the problem of an influx of illegal immigrants.

The report, which has not been adopted yet, is the conclusion of a repeated visit by the evaluation mission regarding the external border of Bulgaria.

These countries, which joined the European Union in 2007, adopted only some of the provisions concerning the Schengen area, and have applied them within this limited scope ever since. The upshot of this situation is that border checks are still carried out along the borders of these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When they joined the EU, these countries were not ready to adopt the Schengen package in its entirety, and have therefore had to reform and extend their policies on border checks. In addition, the section of the border between Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, which is one of the EU’s most vulnerable external borders in terms of illegal emigration, poses an extremely significant problem. Since joining the EU, Bulgaria and Romania have taken numerous measures aimed at properly preparing and protecting their borders. During this entire period, the Schengen Evaluation Working Party has carried out systematic inspections and checks, which have now shown that both countries are sufficiently well prepared to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis satisfactorily.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The abolition of internal border control is particularly important for the entire European Union and each Member State individually. In order for the Schengen area to be able to function effectively and for the goals set to be achieved, it is necessary to ensure that the abolition of border control does not have negative consequences, particularly as regards illegal migration. Every country aiming to join the Schengen area must meet, without exception, all of the conditions of the Schengen acquis concerning data protection, the Schengen Information System, borders in the air, on land and at sea, police cooperation and visas. Moreover, it is very important to ensure that every Member State has strict and effective external border controls. I believe that Romania and Bulgaria will soon be able to become real members, capable of applying all of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. At the moment, particular attention should be paid to Bulgaria, because this country, like Turkey and Greece, lies on the EU’s external borders. It is the most sensitive and fragile place in the Union. When they become full members of the Schengen area, it is therefore crucial for Bulgaria and Romania to be properly prepared to manage increased migration flows, to be able to implement measures to combat illegal migration appropriately and effectively, and to guarantee well-functioning external border control mechanisms.</p>

My group considers the introduction of new criteria for membership at this point to be wrong because this would mean applying double standards for these countries. The difficulties that Romania and Bulgaria still face – organised crime and corruption – are, undoubtedly, serious accusations against the governments of these countries, which should combat these phenomena more effectively.

Thus, Parliament has given the go-ahead for the integration of these two countries into the Schengen area and equal rights for their citizens, who have not enjoyed the right to move freely in the past.

      <p sl="pt">I would congratulate my colleague, Mr Coelho, on his excellent work on the report on the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania. Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the European Union in 2007. The report says that compliance with the necessary conditions for application of the acquis in question – data protection, the Schengen Information System (SIS), air borders, land borders, sea borders, political cooperation and visas – was evaluated on the ground, and progress in the implementation of measures aiming for the abolition of checks at the internal borders with these Member States was confirmed in situ . According to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs who have been monitoring this process, the outstanding issues, which will require regular reports and monitoring in the future, do not constitute an obstacle to these two Member States’ full accession to the Schengen area. For these reasons, I support the decision to open the borders to these Member States. I am voting for this report and welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho proposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ‘Schengen area’. This is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process. The accession of a new State is conditional on strict compliance with the criteria of the Schengen Agreement. In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties – like the European Commission – has concluded after evaluation that these two States meet the conditions laid down in full. Consequently, there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement. I would find it unacceptable if certain States, under false pretexts and motivated by internal political calculation, continued to oppose it. The Community acquis should not be regarded as an à la carte system where Member States can adapt or suspend provisions as circumstances dictate. Therefore, I solemnly call upon the Council to acknowledge the improvements made by Bulgaria and Romania and admit them into the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by the expert teams, it is evident that Romania is now in a position to implement the Schengen acquis fully, all the points meriting attention or reviewing have been remedied (improvement of risk assessment, upgrade of the security features of the buildings, improvement of the process for submitting and processing visa applications and so on) and, in some aspects, it could be considered as a model of best practice.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the evaluation reports, Romania has shown that it is sufficiently prepared to apply both the non-SIS related provisions of the Schengen acquis, as well as its SIS-related provisions, in a satisfactory manner. The preconditions have been fulfilled for the Council to take the decision referred to in Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession, allowing for the lifting of internal controls at air, land and sea borders. This means that the removal of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between Members States regarding the existence of effective external border controls because the security of the Schengen area depends on how rigorously and effectively each Member State controls its external borders.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this report because the full application of the Schengen agreement in Bulgaria and Romania certainly means the abolition of border checks for these countries as well. At a time when some governments are daring to suggest the reestablishment of checks at internal borders, it is even more important to demonstrate our support for the extension of what is, today, one of the European Union’s best achievements. Full application in these Member States is also a question of equality and non-discrimination within Europe because excluding those two countries would send an extremely negative signal to their populations, which are very keen to join the area of freedom of movement. For these reasons, it is important to give this stage broad support.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Balkan region is one of the most sensitive areas of the EU’s external borders in terms of illegal migration. This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face. Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures. In addition, improving controls at external borders must be combined with fighting the corruption of local authorities. I voted against this measure for the reasons stated and to better protect our citizens against illegal immigration.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Accession to the Schengen acquis involves the need to comply with various evaluation procedures: candidate countries have to comply with a range of conditions in order to be admitted to the area of freedom of movement, which currently covers 25 countries and 400 million Europeans. This report evaluates the positions of Bulgaria and Romania, stressing, on the one hand, that Bulgaria follows best practices in various activities and, on the other, the efforts made by Romania as regards the shortcomings that were being detected. In conclusion, while I would stress the need to resolve a number of issues, the evaluation of these two Member States’ behaviour is positive overall.</p>

      <p sl="el">Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they acceded to the EU in 2007. The integration of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area is acceptable, provided that they satisfy certain technical requirements noted in the relevant procedure. As the rapporteur quite rightly points out, the accession of Bulgaria to the Schengen Agreement should be followed by a special plan to combat illegal immigration. Cooperation is needed on the question of land border management. In 2010, 47 000 immigrants were arrested crossing the Greco-Turkish border, passing to the Greek side of the River Evros, which marks the border between Greece and Turkey. This number accounts for 90% of the total in Europe for that year. Within this framework, I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal for a special plan to be prepared as soon as Bulgaria joins the Schengen area, containing actions in this direction and a joint approach between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, so that it is in a position to cope with what may be a large increase in immigration flows.</p>

      <p sl="da">I voted against Bulgaria and Romania becoming full members of the Schengen cooperation at this point in time. The issue concerning Bulgaria giving its military police access to information from Schengen records demonstrates that there are problems with those parts of Schengen that these countries are already included in. There are also problems with corruption and organised crime. Europol points out that the full admission of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen cooperation will give criminal groups from the Balkans and the former Soviet Union easier access to the EU. Until these problems are resolved, full admission of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen will bolster cross-border corruption and crime whilst, at the same time, giving certain forces the opportunity they were waiting for to demand increased monitoring and undermining of the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At a time when more and more people are talking about a crisis of trust in the European Union, the fact that the overwhelming majority of MEPs support the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should be seen as confirmation that the idea of European integration still continues to be relevant. The fact that Bulgaria and Romania have external EU borders should not be regarded as a barrier preventing them from joining the Schengen area. Criteria for joining the area were established with the aim of ensuring the highest possible level of security. Experts have confirmed that the appropriate technical standards have been put in place. The countries have met the requirements imposed on them to an extent which makes it possible to abolish border checks with the remaining EU Member States. It should be emphasised that, as was the case for my country, joining the Schengen area does not mean that Romania and Bulgaria no longer have any work left to do as regards full implementation of the cooperation instrument. Both countries will have much work ahead of them in order to establish good working practices.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The example of Poland shows clearly that the new Member States are able to meet the Schengen requirements effectively. In the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we have the chance to implement the next stage of the political project known as the area of freedom, security and justice, provided appropriate monitoring is carried out by the European institutions. The European Parliament should play a key role in this process, and it must be kept up-to-date with the situation in Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The creation of the Schengen area dates from 1985 and currently includes a territory of 42 673 km of external sea borders and 7 721 km of land borders, taking in 400 million Europeans. The Schengen Agreement currently covers 25 Member States with a common area for the free movement of people, by removing systematic checks at internal borders and creating a single common border. In order to fully realise this agreement, common rules were established – regarding, inter alia , checks along the entire external border, common visa policy, police and judicial cooperation – and the Schengen Information System (SIS) was created. This report concerns the entry of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen acquis and, following the evaluation visits and a final report, it concludes that both countries are ready for full accession. However, some issues remain outstanding, in particular, the need to establish a plan to combat possible pressure from illegal migration. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that there is a need for the Member States in question to inform Parliament and the Council within a six-month period, beginning on the date of entry into force of this decision, on the implementation of these additional measures and progress with the shortcomings identified.</p>

The Bulgarian authorities undertook to bring about radical improvement. The EU established a ‘Cooperation and Verification Mechanism’ to assist Bulgaria and to verify progress against six benchmarks. Improvement has been disappointingly slow. In its most recent report on these matters (February 2011), the Commission stated that Bulgaria needed to improve further the way the judiciary, police and other investigative bodies are structured, managed and cooperate. Nevertheless, the 27 governments in Council concluded, perhaps surprisingly, that Bulgaria fulfilled the conditions for Schengen, a system which is itself under question at the moment.

      <p sl="ro">According to the position of the UDMR (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania), Romania and Bulgaria must receive a definite prospect in 2011 of joining this area of free movement.

      <p sl="lt">A major transformation of the world order is taking place, challenging the European Union to engage more actively with current and emerging world powers and with other bilateral and multilateral partners, in order to promote effective solutions to problems which affect both EU citizens and the world at large. In accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU is formally committed to effective multilateralism with a strong UN at its core, which is essential in order to address global challenges, such as climate change and environmental degradation, the universality and indivisibility of human rights, poverty reduction and development for all, the consequences of demographic change and migration, and international organised crime.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report drafted by Mr Lambsdorff because I think that the EU is creating a new identity for itself on the global stage at the moment. I should remind you of the lengthy period of cooperation between the two international organisations, as well as of the EU’s involvement in numerous projects launched by the UN. I must mention at this point the commitment made by European leaders to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The eradication of poverty globally now features among the Union’s foreign policy priorities. I welcome the initiative for strengthening cooperation on bringing stability to crisis zones and on drawing up new safety standards for nuclear power plants. The course of events in Japan highlights the need for this partnership. In view of the social upheaval in the Mediterranean region, I think that coordinated action between the EU and UN would ensure a peaceful transition to democracy. In this regard, I welcome improving relations with regional organisations.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the next session of the United Nations General Assembly. The proposal underlines that the European Union and the United Nations share the common commitment to promoting democracy, respect for human rights and peace among the international community. The proposal states that the further enlargement of the United Nations Security Council in order to include the EU is a key factor for effectively pursuing the objectives mentioned above. The proposal rejects Germany’s request to occupy the potential new EU seat at the United Nations on a permanent basis and instead incorporates the Italian proposal to allow all Member States to occupy the seat in rotation in order to respect the principle of the equal dignity of all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">The German request had been seen as an attempt to impose the political authority of Germany and the Anglo-French-German bloc within and outwith the EU. However, the adoption of the Italian position through this proposal confirms that the possible enlargement of the Security Council would also assure Italy the chance of having its voice heard on crucial international issues outside the EU. I have therefore voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Regardless of future changes to how the Union is represented within the UN, and in the Security Council – a debate which is still open – in particular, there is increasingly a need to join up the efforts of European countries so as to, alongside the Union’s representatives overseas, encourage a collective capacity for intervention and influence. Regular consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States and those of the EU will be an important step along this path. At the same time, the Union should contribute to making the UN more efficient and transparent, and improve the management of its financial resources. The creation of a United Nations parliamentary assembly within the framework of the United Nations system is an interesting proposal that is worth studying and debating.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report by Mr Lambsdorff concerns a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the 66th Session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. The transformation of the present international order at global level through conflicts in various parts of the world, and the self-determination of many peoples that have been downtrodden for decades, or even centuries, make the upcoming session of the UN General Assembly unusually significant. Pursuant to Articles 21 and 41 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament could not fail to take advantage of this session to push its positions on a number of subjects: not least, the role of the EU in the UN system; the EU and global governance; peace, security and justice; development; human rights; and climate change. I therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposals mentioned above, as well as with the need to foster a debate on the role of parliaments and national assemblies in the UN system, and on creating a UN parliamentary assembly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report advocates giving the European Union a seat on the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and a permanent seat on the Security Council. A number of voices have been heard advocating this idea in recent times, supported by the amendments introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, specifically, the attribution of ‘legal personality’ to the EU. These are amendments whose legitimacy we have always contested. This demand – which subverts the spirit of the organisation: an organisation of states and not of supranational organisations – is not being made with the intention of making the UN’s workings more democratic or of creating a new world order that is fairer and more peaceful.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU’s alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the United States to undertake wars and carry out acts of aggression in countries like Libya is proof of this. It is fundamental principles of the UN Charter, such as non-intervention in states’ internal affairs, respect for their sovereignty and independence, and recognition of their right to development, that the EU has been placing at risk. Sovereignty comes from the people and the peoples of Europe have not given it to this EU, which is increasingly anti-social and anti-democratic.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report again makes the unacceptable demand that the European Union have a seat at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and a permanent seat on the Security Council, as a result of the anti-democratic Treaty of Lisbon and the ‘legal personality’ acquired from it. It is not with the intention of making the workings of either the UN body more democratic, or of creating a new, fairer world order, that the majority in the European Parliament is doing this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">How can an EU which, in alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the United States, is promoting a war, and violating international law and the UN Charter in Libya, contribute to making the UN more democratic, or to humanity’s peace and progress? How can the EU contribute to non-intervention in states’ internal affairs, and respect their sovereignty and independence, and their right to development – rights enshrined in the UN Charter and in international law – when, in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is imposing an unprecedented programme of aggression against the workers and people of Portugal, and of the usurping of their resources? It cannot.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Furthermore, it touches on important issues, such as strengthening the role of the International Criminal Court and the international criminal justice system, promoting accountability, putting an end to impunity, and strengthening the crisis-prevention structures and their effectiveness within the United Nations Development Programme, with a view to transforming this organisation into a global leader in crisis prevention and recovery. It also stresses the need for close cooperation between the EU and the UN in the area of civilian and military crisis management, particularly in humanitarian relief operations, and the need to thoroughly reform the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), by bringing to an end its dual function of both monitoring and promoting nuclear energy use, and to limit the IAEA’s responsibilities to overseeing the nuclear energy industry and verifying compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as other important issues, which I basically agree with and support.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the run-up to the 66th ordinary session of the UN General Assembly, the European Parliament, as usual, addressed its recommendations to the Council, representing the Member States, who are the only fully fledged members of the organisation. However, this year, the Union will be able to take advantage of its new ‘super-observer’ status, which confers special rights to speak during sessions. I voted in favour of this resolution because it is commensurate with the Union’s new ambitions at international level. The Treaty of Lisbon grants the EU new prerogatives, confirms the development of its international capacity and puts new tools in place. Following this act, the Union must use this new ambition in the service of effective multilateralism, with the full strength of its values at the core. It also calls for a strengthening of global governance at a time when global challenges require global solutions. Finally, it focuses on core themes that the Union must play a role in advancing, as is its custom: development, human rights and climate change.</p>

This represents an essential starting point for dealing with climate change and environmental degradation, the universality and indivisibility of human rights, poverty reduction and development for all, the consequences of demographic change, migration and international organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have permanent structures for external representation. This allows us to take an international role in line with our pre-eminent economic status and to act as a global player capable of sharing the responsibility for security around the world. It is down to us to clearly identify our interests and strategic objectives in order to be able to act effectively. The European Union is the world’s largest provider of development aid and a major partner of the UN in crisis and post-crisis situations.

      <p sl="pt">The EU cannot forget its role in every respect as a leading actor on the world stage. As such, it needs to increase its role in all the multilateral organisations and, in particular, the United Nations (UN), where its role must be increasingly active following the launch of the European External Action Service (EEAS). Given that global partnerships are instrumental in achieving jointly identified global goals; that the EU is the world’s largest provider of development aid and a major partner of the UN in its efforts across all three pillars of its work, including in crisis and post-crisis situations; and that Member States’ contribution amounts to 38% of the UN’s regular budget, we believe a solid and stable EU-UN partnership is fundamental to the work of the UN and key to the EU’s role as a global player.</p>

Greater cohesion should be fostered both within the UN system and between the positions of EU Member States and candidate and potential candidate countries, so as to maximise the potential offered by the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU’s impact through the coordinated and strategic use of its various and distinct (EU and Member State) entry points.

One of the most important proposals, which I also support, is the simplification of administrative requirements for projects implemented according to this programme. In fact, one of the difficulties noted is the complexity and burden of administrative procedures, as a result of which researchers seeking European financing are diverted towards national financing and Europe is made unpopular with regard to research. It is also very important for research and development policies to be territorialised so that research is distributed harmoniously in relation to all universities.

Research is the process of converting economic power into knowledge, while innovation is the reverse process of transforming knowledge into economic power. The European Union and its Member States must create for themselves the means to respond jointly to the major social, economic, environmental, demographic and ethical challenges facing Europe’s states, such as an ageing population, citizens’ health, food supply, sustainable development and the major environmental issues.</p>

FP7 is a chance for the European Union to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, particularly by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Looking at Mr Audy’s report, I agree on the objectives highlighted in the mid-term review, particularly with regard to the simplification of administrative procedures, the participation of small and medium–sized enterprises through the Cooperation programme, and revamping and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility.

Currently, Irish bodies receive about €1 million a week from EU research funds, and other opportunities remain for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It is the SMEs that create 70% of the jobs in the euro area, and the SME sector is at the heart of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Therefore, transparency must be increased and the administrative burden reduced so that more SMEs would be interested in becoming involved in programmes in the future, to ensure the Union’s effectiveness in relation to research, development and innovation. Time-to-grant must be reduced and European cooperation and coordination improved in order to tackle the fragmentation which is currently damaging to the programme.</p>

      <p sl="lt">On 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council, meeting in Lisbon, set the European Union (EU) an ambitious strategic objective: to become, by 2010, the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. The central role played by research in this strategy has been acknowledged. Allocated a budget of around EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy. Its aim is to enable the EU to respond to the great societal challenges that concern all Member States and to which they cannot respond alone (ageing population and health, energy and water supplies or food supplies, sustainable development, climate change, and so on), as well as to develop the knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness. In this report, the European Parliament is carrying out a mid-term review in order to ensure that FP7 meets the needs of European policies. I agree that in order to ensure that this programme is as effective as possible, it is necessary to simplify complicated and burdensome administrative procedures so as to successfully create a European Research Area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The EU’s Seventh Framework Programme is a crucial programme for improving the European added value in terms of research, development and innovation, at a time when Europe is lagging behind the United States in these areas, and is losing the headway it had over the emerging economies. Therefore, this report serves to highlight the relevance of an unknown programme while calling for changes: to alter the overly burdensome administrative and financial regulations and the low rate of success that make this programme still too prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), at a time when they play an important role in turning research outcomes into products and services; to ensure better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders at a time when the funding of research still remains split between national and European sources. These are a few initiatives that could at last enable us to reach the goal of financing research and development set at 3% of GDP by 2020, which is far from being achieved, in particular for France, which still only devotes 2% of its GDP to R&amp;D.</p>

      <p sl="it">In March 2000, the Council set the European Union the ambitious objective of becoming ‘the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world’ by 2010. The central role played by research in this strategy has been acknowledged. I think that examining the review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development offers an opportunity to cement the precious link between knowledge, education and research. Over the years, FP7 has become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy. It also offers a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions by consolidating the European Research Area.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, there are two main aspects that the review should focus on in particular: overcoming the problems related to the burden and complexity of administrative procedures, as a result of which those seeking European financing are diverted towards national financing. Added to which, despite the progress made in recent years, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Framework Programme should be stepped up in order to develop the skills that would allow them to boost their competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="es">I voted for the resolution because the Europe 2020 programme considers research and innovation to be central for emerging from the crisis by means of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. For that to happen, the Seventh Framework Programme must increase its funding from 2013 onwards. The Member States must commit themselves to continuing with the programmes as there must be increased collaboration between technology platforms, universities and the industrial sector as well as further simplification of procedures to eliminate the difficulties faced by small and medium-sized enterprises in accessing the research and development programmes.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report by Mr Audy on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities certainly contains a number of pleasing aspects. For example, it looks at the fact that the programme has had a low success rate with small and medium-sized enterprises and also considers the request to shorten time-to-grant periods. However, I abstained in the vote because this own-initiative report contained a point which I thought was particularly weak, which made it impossible for me to vote in favour. Specifically, I do not support Mr Audy’s call to increase funding for the European Research Council, as well as making it an independent legal entity with decision-making power which would be directly responsible for its own scientific strategy and administrative management.</p>

This programme is one of the most important research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy. Furthermore, in many of the documents it has adopted recently, setting out its development goals and guidelines for the next decade, the European Union stresses the importance of research and innovation for strengthening the EU economy and helping it remain one of the most competitive in the world. In addition to the generally positive assessment, the report draws the Commission’s attention to many aspects of the programme’s implementation and provides specific proposals as to how they might be improved. For example, the report proposes increasing the programme’s financing but, at the same time, it proposes identifying common research areas among those which appear most promising in terms of concrete applications, enabling the highest extent of sharing in an ethical context, so that tangible results are achieved when implementing this programme.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Despite the fact that Europe is still behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the developing economies, the results of the Seventh Framework Programme demonstrate the added value of this European programme for research and development in Europe. Unfortunately, however, there is still no method for evaluating how far the projects funded by the Seventh Framework Programme have advanced scientific knowledge. It is also necessary to point out the considerable imbalance between the participation of entities from the old and new Member States. Equally, the level of involvement particularly of small and medium-sized enterprises remains relatively poor. The situation could be improved by simplifying the administrative and financial rules.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is necessary to emphasise the importance of the Joint Technological Initiatives (JTI) for the competitiveness of European industry. It is also necessary to point out the legal and administrative obstacles (legal subjectivity, funding rules and sometimes also intellectual property) which may dissuade many key research players and SMEs from participating. We must change the situation where the funding of research in Europe is too fragmented, while there are many sources of funding in the Member States and the EU applying different priorities, evaluation criteria, definitions and procedures, which necessarily leads to overlaps, confusion and errors.</p>

In my view, simplifying administrative procedures and cutting red tape is still the most important challenge if we really want to let our businesses – and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – have access to funds.

EUR 28.5 billion remains to be programmed for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. This sum must be allocated as a matter of priority to projects put forward by SMEs and industry in general, particularly in the areas of energy provision, sustainable development and the fight against climate change.

On 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council, meeting in Lisbon, set the European Union an objective: to become, by 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world. It has not been possible to achieve this ambitious goal. I hope that the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy will be met, in particular, the EU’s commitment to invest 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in research and development by 2020. Europe 2020 cannot wait for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF): it must start now. Therefore, this review is of crucial importance, since 50% of the funding for FP7 has still not been spent. I therefore agree with the rapporteur, specifically as regards the recommendations regarding the need to simplify mechanisms for accessing funds, making procedures simpler and more transparent, and facilitating the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises. It should also invest in flagship areas like health, energy and nuclear safety, responding to the new challenges of innovation and research.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report introduces several important aspects of the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Union for research and technological development. It also makes relevant observations, such as that the majority of the EU’s scientific work is still undertaken by researchers and technicians – mainly young people – in insecure jobs; the Portuguese case is paradigmatic.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We believe that there is a need to support public research and make its results available in a simple way, without bureaucracy, by promoting: productive and business activity, and small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular; the creation of skilled jobs, with rights; social progress and sustainable development. There is a need for a commitment to areas as diverse as, inter alia , energy efficiency, new energy sources, efficient resource use, recycling and new productive processes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot fail to express our concern about some of the principles guiding the European Research Area. We believe it should be founded on cooperation and mutual benefit, mitigating the currently existing inequalities in national research systems, and reversing any trends towards concentration of scientific and human resources in the more developed countries, which is the same as in so-called ‘centres of excellence’.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report introduces several relevant aspects of the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development. Particularly important is its concern to ensure that 40% of those taking part in research are women, as this figure is currently no higher than 25.5%, and to recognise that ‘Europe continues to lag behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the emerging economies’. The report also ‘regrets that most of the scientific work carried out within the EU is still done under precarious working conditions’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, we are concerned about some aspects, not least the principles guiding the European Research Area, since it should be focused on cooperation between genuine research and collaboration networks, reversing any trends towards concentration of scientific and human resources in the more developed countries and mitigating the currently existing inequalities in national research systems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Innovation in micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises requires support for public research and its results must be made available in a simple way, without bureaucracy, whether it be in terms of energy efficiency, using new sources of energy and new production processes, recycling and making better use of resources, or creating jobs with rights, or whether it be in human and social terms, with a view to social progress.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The main point of this report is that the European Union must do its utmost to stay at the top of the research, innovation and science sectors. If we do not have the research foundation today, we will not achieve excellence in innovation in the future. Good research resources are needed to create and foster employment in the EU and to boost the EU’s competitiveness, particularly as the industrially developing countries grow in strength. Collaboration between the private and public sectors must be developed and SMEs encouraged to participate more fully in the programme. This encouragement must come from the high authorities. At a meeting on 4 February, the leaders of the EU and of Member States stated their commitment to the Innovation Union flagship initiative. Now, however, action must be taken to match their words. Research and innovation are what will help us escape from the economic deadlock which we are in at present.</p>

It calls, in particular, for the alignment of the FP7 objectives with EU strategies on resource efficiency, raw materials and the Digital Agenda. The remaining sums should not be diverted from research and used for other programmes or instruments that do not come within the research and innovation sector or the objectives and scope of FP7. There is a need to enhance, stimulate and secure the financing of research and development in the European Union via a significant increase in relevant expenditure from 2013 onwards, because such an increase in funding, ideally by increasing the budget, must foster sustainable growth and competition via excellence. This increase in funds must be coupled with a more result-oriented, performance-driven approach and with a radical simplification of funding procedures. I believe that we need to support further cooperation between different EU research, technological development and innovation programmes, and feel that the continuity of the future programme, once established, is important for all actors involved.</p>

Similar challenges are posed by climate change, unexpected deficits of raw materials and biological threats, for example, the recent developments concerning E coli bacteria in vegetables. The way to find solutions to such unusual situations is investment in science and technological development. Although we have held many debates on this issue, the measures taken in Europe have, unfortunately, been ineffectual, despite the threat posed to our continent and our economy. The latter is not self-sufficient, and is additionally faced with the domination of the Chinese, Indian and Brazilian economies, which are developing extraordinarily rapidly.

This would give a new impetus to our economic growth and an improvement in the standard of living of our citizens. We have the ability to meet this goal by performing a series of domestic tasks, the most important of which is the reduction of bureaucratic hurdles. In order to become the citadel of innovation, we must sacrifice the bureaucracy that does not allow for funds to flow to researchers and entrepreneurs. Saddled with the old and rigid system of bureaucracy hindering the development of new and dynamic businesses, the European Union will not reach its target – to invest 3% of GDP in research and innovation by 2020. The European Union must change with the times and must cast off the chains of red tape. This approach must be implemented beginning with the research programme, which is a source of funding for new inventions, for the realisation of new ideas, and new jobs.</p>

It was precisely the direct impact of this instrument on everyday life that led me to vote in favour of the report by Mr Audy, in the hope that future innovation policies will make the absolute most of the synergies in the whole research and development value chain. The Seventh Framework Programme – which is mainly oriented towards research and technological development – is currently the only instrument for achieving the objectives laid down in the Innovation Union initiative and for expediting the transformation of Europe into a knowledge-based society.

The report by Mr Audy learns lessons from the first part of the Framework Programme for research. In order to achieve the Europe 2020 goals, it proposes that the rest of the programme should focus on the Union’s most pressing challenges within the sectors identified in the ‘Cooperation’ chapter of the Seventh Framework Programme: health, food and biotechnology, information and communication technology, nanoscience and nanotechnologies, energy, the SET Plan and the use of biogas, environment, sustainable transport, social sciences, economics and humanities, and space and security. I voted in favour of this report because it not only makes an assessment of the situation but also sets ambitious targets for the Union which live up to the expectations of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">FP7 is a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, in particular, by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Allocated a budget of around EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, FP7 has, over the years, become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy. Four main objectives have been identified and correspond to four specific programmes that must structure the European research effort: the Cooperation Programme, the Ideas Programme, the People Programme and the Capacity Programme. The aim is to enable the EU to respond to the great societal challenges that concern all Member States and to which they cannot respond alone (ageing population and health, energy, water and food supplies, sustainable development, climate change, and so on), as well as to develop the knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness.</p>

We believe that FP7 is a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, in particular, by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). In addition, research and development policies need to be territorialised and the Union must adopt an ambitious European research plan for defence technology with a view to enhancing the sector’s industrial and technological base, while also improving the efficiency of military public spending. Lastly, we agree with the Committee on Budgets that the design and implementation of all framework programmes must be based on the principles of simplicity, stability, legal certainty, consistency, excellence and trust, while also strengthening links between European institutions for research and industry.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Seventh Framework Programme is not just about research in general; it is also about a specific field of research that ought to be of particular concern to all of us following the Fukushima disaster. It is a question of funding from the Euratom programme. What is the use of productive reactors if they buckle under water masses and in the event of earthquakes? What is the use of the most productive nuclear power station if a minor fault is enough to make not only the immediate surroundings, but broad swathes of land, uninhabitable for decades? It is important for us to focus more on nuclear safety and to push ahead with the development of alternatives. Now that the Euratom research programme is shortly to be extended for the period 2012-2013, Fukushima ought to be taken as an opportunity for a rethink. We need to focus more on protection against radiation and final storage. It is a matter of life or death that we should not stick to the same priorities, in other words, the expansion of nuclear power, but rather that we should concentrate on safety aspects. The present research programme is, of course, unaffected by this. I have taken this into account when voting.</p>

Unfortunately, the Seventh Framework Programme also includes funding for research in the field of nuclear power. However, the report also calls for stricter regulations for the EU’s INDECT programme. It states that the EU Commission should immediately publish all project documents and define a clear and strict mandate for the research goal, the application and end users of INDECT.

I therefore agree on rewording the main objectives and stress the need for a more efficient research policy that cuts out the burden of red tape and provides for greater participation from small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as innovation and funding integration.

The Lisbon strategy set an ambitious goal for the European Union: to become, by 2010, the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. The central role played by research was acknowledged in this strategy. This desire was not realised, for a number of reasons. The decade 2000-2010, which ended with an extremely serious economic crisis, will be evaluated in the future. It is now important, and I share the rapporteur’s ambition in this respect, to analyse the work done and reorganise future work. FP7 is another opportunity for the EU to put its research policy on a par with its economic and social ambitions, not least by consolidating the European Research Area. FP7 is one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy. The specific existing programmes, like the Cooperation programme, the Ideas programme, the People programme and the Capacity programme, can and should enable the development of knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) needs to be reviewed in order to bring it further into line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. If European research policy is to be more competitive and in tune with the EU’s economic and social ambitions, FP7 needs to be tailored to four major objectives: promoting the simplification of the framework programmes for research and cutting the burdens of administrative procedures; improving the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); strengthening the innovation dimension and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, we need to focus on the importance of collaboration between the academic world, public research institutes and the industrial sector. We must place greater emphasis on proposals for collaborative research between the public and industrial sectors, ease cooperation between networks of SMEs, universities and public research institutes, and the main criteria for choosing FP7 projects must now include an assessment of the possible impact on the market, technology transfer and the commercial use of research outcomes. I voted in favour of reviewing FP7 for these very reasons and also so that the EU can be more competitive in the field of research without having to wait for the Eighth Framework Programme.</p>

This report then sets out specific proposals with the aim of resolving the programme’s weaknesses. It rightly highlights the need to simplify funding procedures and optimise existing instruments, so as to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises.

      <p sl="en">Given the economic crises the EU is facing, it is essential we identify which areas of our activities lend themselves to helping us overcome our difficulties. Research and innovation are central to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, so investment in R&amp;D is the best possible response. Considering the numerous political and economic changes that have taken place since the Seventh Framework Programme was adopted, it is necessary to amend FP7 to reflect the situation of the new reality. Given the importance of knowledge-based industries to Europe and our thriving R&amp;D sector, we cannot afford to wait until FP8 to take action. The ‘Lisbon strategy’ of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 may have failed, but this does not mean we should abandon it entirely. We must continue to work towards this goal by amending FP7. In doing so, we should address a serious failure under FP7 to provide funding for research in maternal and child health. Close to 400 000 babies are born prematurely annually, yet there is no funding for research in this area. Pre-term birth is the number one cause of infant death and premature babies are far more likely to develop lifelong chronic illnesses.</p>

Therefore, the evaluation of the Framework Programme can play a significant role in this respect: in other words, by seeking to reduce the obstacles to the European economy’s growth that have been emerging, specifically by cutting red tape in procedures for accessing research support programmes.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Four years have passed since the introduction of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development. In the context of a changing global economic situation and at a time when Europe is slowly attempting to extricate itself from the economic crisis, it is becoming clear that the programme was put in place to solve legitimate and significant problems. The global competition of major economic powers such as China, India and Brazil is forcing us to take special measures, aimed at gaining a technological advantage allowing us to implement the European Union’s intended strategy effectively. The right investments in research and scientific development will translate into the long-term construction of a knowledge-based society, which is one of the most important components of economic power. The report touches upon the key issue of insufficient cooperation and exchange of information between Member States, which results in the duplication of individual projects. A further alarming matter is the unequal participation of the Member States, which results in greater imbalances in an area as important as research and technological development. This is a complete contradiction of the goals of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a result of the economic crisis, some Member States no longer have as many opportunities to provide support for the programme, and this is a challenge to the EU to identify accurately those who need support, and to grant support to them. The programme’s implementation will last another two years, and the level of budgetary commitment has not exceeded 50% (of EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013), which should make it easier to involve the competent bodies and enable the funds available to be used as appropriately as possible.</p>

According to data from the World Bank, Lithuania has great potential to become a dynamic, knowledge-based economy.

We must overcome these obstacles if we want to make real progress. This also poses problems for Europe. In Europe, R&amp;D expenditure is low compared to other global powers, due to a lack of private investment and favourable conditions for innovation.

I welcome an agreement with Canada going beyond the WTO commitments and being complementary to multilateral rules, provided that the negotiations produce a balanced, ambitious, high-quality agreement that goes well beyond tariff reductions, and other tools begin to be applied.

      <p sl="fr">By voting in favour of this resolution on the current trade negotiations between the EU and Canada, I wish to reiterate the importance of international trade (including with Canada) for developing our economies. As stated in the resolution, even though Europe must continue giving priority to the international trading system, that is, the Doha Development Round negotiations, the current negotiations with Canada can usefully complement this international approach with a bilateral approach, which is equally necessary. Thus, by discussing and negotiating, we are managing to find solutions on issues related to trade and respect for certain principles, such as those concerning the environment. However, as Vice-Chair of the working group on public services, I am concerned about the approach chosen for this sector. Indeed, by adopting a ‘negative list approach’ (a list that excludes certain public services from the liberalisation process) and not, on the contrary, ‘a positive list approach’ (exempting public services from liberalisation, except those featured in the list), we may well end up weakening public services.

Indeed, the European Commission, responsible for negotiating this agreement, seems to want all services to be included, in principle. By negotiating a ‘negative’ list of services that would not be included in the free trade agreements, and if it were to go ahead, the Commission would be reversing the rationale that has prevailed hitherto. Yet public services are not like other services: because they provide social and territorial cohesion as well as essential support to vulnerable populations, these services have features specific to the general interest they seek to attain. Consequently, it is crucial to continue adopting an approach that protects these services, particularly by protecting them from international competition.</p>

When we embark on negotiations with these countries, we should remember how strict and exacting we have been with extremely enlightened places like Canada and adopt the same direct and open attitude in defence of our interests.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the resolution on EU-Canada trade relations aimed at establishing a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. Canada is a close trading partner of the European Union: over 10 years, Canadian investment in Europe almost doubled, reaching EUR 119.5 million in 2009. It is therefore necessary to establish an advanced legal framework so as to ensure a positive impact on growth. I would like to highlight the issue of market access for agricultural products. Rules of origin are different in Canada and the EU, and the Commission must make sure that the interests and priorities of European agriculture are properly taken into account. In particular, efforts should be made to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of rules of origin so that products from other North American Free Trade Agreement members do not follow in the wake of Canadian products.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As part of the ongoing negotiations on the trade agreement between the EU and Canada, the Commission must undertake to comply with the European Parliament’s demands. In a free trade agreement, two things are vital: first, ensuring reciprocity in respect of social and environmental legislation; second, adopting a consistent and protective approach to services of general interest. European environmental and health standards should not be lowered just to satisfy our partner. The European Commission must consider the consequences of its decision to include all services automatically and by default. While this method allows certain public services to be excluded on a case-by-case basis and at the request of each Member State by establishing a ‘negative’ list, it nevertheless runs the risk of potential omissions. Parliament does not wish for this new model of negotiation to set a legal precedent. Up to now, the Commission has negotiated free trade agreements by providing a ‘positive’ list, listing services covered by the agreement one by one. This method, which is commonly used in international trade, provides a better safeguard for certain sensitive sectors for the EU and should therefore be the sole method used by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This motion for a resolution is on EU-Canada trade relations, whose negotiations are expected to be concluded by the end of 2011. The goal of the EU’s trade and investment policy is economic growth that is sustainable, generates wealth and creates jobs. Let us recall that the conclusion of trade relationships with our strategic partners will enable the EU to have added value of 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020, which was EUR 120 billion in 2010, benefiting consumers and businesses alike. To this end, and without questioning the role played by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is crucial to liberalise trade by concluding all negotiations under way within the framework of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), of which EU-Canada trade relations are part. Although some issues remain unresolved, such as the negative impact on biodiversity of tar sands extraction and of some seal-derived products, I voted in favour not only because the public procurement problem has practically been resolved, but also because of the benefits to the Member States, and to prevent the negotiations from suffering any delays.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed the document because the EU and Canada have a close relationship as far as trade and foreign direct investment are concerned. The ongoing negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) aim at a very advanced agreement, exceeding in its level of ambition any trade and economic agreement negotiated either by the EU or by Canada to date, that could reinforce the already strong bilateral trade and investment relationship even further. I welcome an agreement with Canada going beyond the WTO commitments and being complementary to multilateral rules, provided that the negotiations produce a balanced, ambitious, high-quality agreement. I feel that agriculture chapters will constitute an important issue for both parties in these negotiations. I am concerned about possibly substantial concessions in the area of GMOs, milk and origin labelling. The interests and the priorities in agriculture should therefore be fully taken into account and the agreement must be beneficial to EU and Canadian consumers and to the agricultural sectors on both sides as well, and ensure, within a balanced overall outcome, greater – but fair – competition among EU and Canadian suppliers providing agricultural goods. I welcome the initial commitment from both parties not to maintain, introduce or reintroduce agricultural export subsidies on the agricultural goods traded, this being a positive step in the interests of ambitious and fair negotiations, as well as the agreement to cooperate in WTO agricultural negotiations.</p>

I particularly support the reservations expressed by the European Parliament in relation to the possible negative impact on European agriculture. The principle of mutuality must be preserved in order to ensure a solid, sustainable agreement for both sides. In this context, I would like particularly to refer to the debate on origin labelling for slaughter cattle which needs to be resolved, as well as tariff-related and technical obstacles, such as protracted approval procedures for EU products. Clearly, the aim of the CETA must be fair competition.</p>

Since the agricultural sector is of fundamental importance, we urge the Commission to negotiate an agreement that is beneficial for producers and consumers alike, and which ensures fair competition between providers of agricultural products from the European Union and Canada. Lastly, we think that the Council should obtain Parliament’s consent before signing any further international commercial agreements, and that Parliament should be kept informed throughout all phases of the procedure in order to guarantee greater democratic control.

      <p sl="fr">I voted for the resolution but against Amendment 10 which supports the ban on importing seal products imposed by the EU. This ban is not justified, neither scientifically nor legally. Indeed, the conclusions of the scientific opinion given by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) at the end of 2007 are based on data concerning the slaughter of animals in abattoirs and which are not reliable with regard to seal hunting. The legal base is also questionable, as the European Parliament’s legal opinion, dated 1 April 2009, shows: ‘It seems virtually impossible to justify the ban on the sole basis of animal well-being, since the Treaty contains no legal basis on animal well-being’. The protection of the species, for its part, is not at stake, its population having even tripled in Greenland over 25 years. Finally, an embargo on which the Commission gives assurances that there would be no impact on Inuit traditional hunting is unrealistic. In this context, the request submitted by Canada to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) concerning the creation of a special dispute settlement body in relation to the European embargo is justified.</p>

There are two other issues that came up in the negotiations that are quite sensitive in the EP. The first issue concerns the Canadian oil sands and the EU’s Fuel Quality Directive. The Fuel Quality Directive has been highly debated in the Committee on the Environment. As yet, the Canadian Government believes this directive discriminates between Canadian oil imports and oil imports from other countries. I consider the agreement to be too early. The second issue is the EU’s ban on seal products and it is highly important.

Furthermore, in the event of commercial disputes, the reciprocity principle should be applied, the protection of intellectual property rights should be improved and there should be reciprocal access to the services and public procurement markets. Particular attention should be paid to the agricultural sector and consumers. We must maintain a firm stance on GMOs, milk and origin labelling. We must ensure fair and greater competition among agricultural goods suppliers. I feel that the Commission should begin negotiations with Canada on investment once Parliament has expressed its position on the future EU investment policy. We must protect the parties’ most sensitive sectors, so that they are excluded from the scope of investment agreements.

Therefore, a particularly close economic relationship between the EU and Canada seems justified. As stressed in the report, the EU is Canada’s second most important trade partner. For its part, in 1976, Canada became the first industrialised country with which the EU signed a framework agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, and it is the EU’s fourth largest source of foreign direct investment.

      <p sl="pl">Economic relations between the EU and Canada are of key significance for the development of dialogue between the two parties. After the US, the EU is Canada’s biggest trade partner, whereas Canada is the EU’s 11th biggest trade partner. The aim of the ongoing negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is the conclusion of a very wide-ranging agreement, with more ambitious goals than any of the economic and trade agreements negotiated to date by either the EU or Canada. Bilateral trade and investment links are already strong, and this may result in them becoming even stronger. According to the joint report by experts from the EU and Canada, the conclusion of a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is intended to provide tangible economic benefits, which will result from trade liberalisation and the elimination of tariff barriers. Nevertheless, certain problems still remain regarding this agreement, which may have a negative impact on the EU’s agricultural sector.</p>

Credit rating agency (CRA) ratings fulfil several useful purposes: they aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers in a global environment. Ratings allow issuers to assess global and domestic markets, reducing information costs and widening the potential pool of investors, and this provides markets with liquidity and helps to set prices. The recent financial crisis has highlighted three problems in the industry: a lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings on the part of CRAs. I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that credit ratings are not just pure opinions and that CRAs should be accountable for their ratings. Therefore, their exposure to civil liability should be enhanced in order to provide a credible threat.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of Mr Klinz’s report on credit rating agencies. Credit rating agencies are useful: they provide information about the quality of credit products, enabling debtors and investors to access global and domestic markets and ultimately help fix prices. However, the crisis has demonstrated the dangers created by the current system: the lack of competition and a lack of accountability and transparency of agencies in particular. This is an own-initiative report which calls on the European Commission to clearly identify the shortcomings of the current framework and to provide an impact study outlining the potential different alternatives for improving the system, including new legislation if necessary. I urge the Commission to respond to our request as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this important document. Rating agencies assess not just private equity companies and their products, but also countries. The conditions under which a country can expect to borrow on international markets depend on the rating it receives. Negative ratings in the face of financial difficulties send a country into a kind of debt spiral, because a falling rating increases the cost of borrowing even more and makes the country’s financial situation even worse. All market participants and their supervisors must know the criteria used to set ratings and be able to check these themselves. The Commission and the G20 countries are asked to establish a new global approach to assessment, which would reduce the likelihood of errors, would regulate the activities of companies involved in ratings and would reduce the risk associated with financial assessment. I welcome and have, on several occasions, repeated the proposal that Europe urgently needs to establish its own credit rating agency, which would produce objective and independent assessments. I welcome the report’s call to establish our own independent rating agency, which, according to the proposals, would initially be called the European Credit Rating Foundation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The possibilities for all EU Member States to borrow in international markets under the right conditions, as well as the stability of the whole global financial system and the effectiveness of crisis prevention, will depend on how successfully we can reform financial assessment.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The recent financial crisis has drawn attention to three key problems in the area of rating agencies, which are the lack of economic competition, the excessive dependency of the regulatory framework on external rating assessments, and the fact that the rating agencies provide no guarantee for their ratings. I am not sure whether the rapporteur’s proposal to establish a European Rating Agency is a sensible solution. There is no guarantee that the European Rating Agency would acquire a good reputation and would become a genuine new player among rating agencies, that it would be credible, or that it would be able to convince the market of its absolute independence of any public body, whether the Member States, the European Commission or any other public entity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The rapporteur’s proposal to establish a network of European rating agencies seems more sensible to me, since cooperation between rating agencies active at national level in making use of the available human and financial resources should encourage competition in this area by covering a broad range of activities and different markets, thereby making it possible to achieve the same level as the large rating agencies which have a global scale of operations.</p>

It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for these agencies, which have played such a negative role in the present crisis, to continue to have the right, granted by the EU itself, to rate not only companies, but also the economies of the Member States. The European Parliament should be more decisive and radical in its decisions on action by credit rating agencies, especially after the damage they have caused to European economies and European citizens. However, the report is spineless. The regulations it proposes are cowardly and the lack of transparency surrounding credit rating agencies basically remains as before. By no stretch of the imagination has the problem been resolved of ratings by self-seeking private firms, be they American now or European in the future, which alone foster the speculation mafia. The report should promote a public, democratically-controlled agency which has nothing to do with private interests and which can play a particular role within the framework of solidarity between the States and their citizens.</p>

I, too, believe that CRAs play a necessary and extremely useful role in distilling and simplifying the torrent of information about the financial markets, both in terms of the solvency and reliability of debt issuers as well as in terms of individual financial instruments. However, as Mr Klinz rightly points out, this business model risks drawing attention away from protecting investors and towards protecting debt issuers, unless suitable corrective measures are taken. I do not think that competition can be improved, since the proliferation of agencies could undermine the credibility of ratings. However, I think that greater responsibility could translate into greater objectivity and more thorough work, which would protect not just the affairs of the few but help reduce information imbalances, which amounts to safeguarding the functioning of the markets and also the general interest.</p>

The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are major problems with this business, such as over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs. Indeed, CRAs played a significant role in the build-up to the financial crisis through the assignment of faulty ratings to structured finance instruments. This report, in advance of the legislative proposal the Commission is preparing for the autumn, addresses these issues, calling for: a review of whether and how Member States use ratings for regulatory purposes in order to reduce the general over-reliance on them of the financial regulatory system; a detailed impact assessment and viability study on the costs, benefits and potential governance structure of a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation; the exploration of establishing a truly independent European Credit Rating Agency; the establishment of a European Rating Index which incorporates all ratings of registered CRAs that are available on the market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">One after the other, credit rating agencies are downgrading the credit ratings of those European countries affected most by the crisis or placing them on ‘negative alert’. I am talking about Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain. Although the agencies may not have triggered the global financial crisis, such actions on their part have, nonetheless, exacerbated it. In fact, they encourage speculation, jeopardising the chances of success of the already draconian recovery plans imposed on their people. That is why the creation of a European credit rating agency is urgent, adopting the legal status of an independent foundation. There must also be an end to the conflicts of interest inherent in credit rating agencies, which are currently able to issue ratings whilst acting as consultants. This is a change that should go hand in hand with the Commission’s assessment of the need for greater disclosure of information for all products in the field of financial instruments.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The role played by the credit rating agencies (CRAs) is undoubtedly important for the current market economy. These agencies started out as information middlemen, facilitating access to the market for debt issuers and investors, enabling reduced information costs and, therefore, greater liquidity and transparency. However, as is the case in many other areas of this sector, the crisis has demonstrated three key problems: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for CRA ratings. There is an urgent need to review the role of these agencies for regulating the global financial market and find effective solutions for their lack of competition.

Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 was the first reaction to the financial crisis and already deals with the most pressing issues, subjecting CRAs to oversight and regulation. However, I hope that greater transparency in the actions of CRAs will be obligatory. The absence of regulatory certainty in this sector is putting the proper functioning of EU financial markets at risk and therefore requires the Commission, before tabling further amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, to identify properly the gaps in the new framework and provide an impact assessment on the range of alternatives available to fill such gaps, including the possibility of further legislative proposals.

Nonetheless, they continue to have free rein, and their actions are extremely damaging, especially for countries with weaker economies.

These agencies are a clear expression of the financialisation of the economy – that do not translate or correspond to actual increases in productive activity – and they constitute a central part of neoliberalism’s development strategy, which is always seeking levels of profit that real production cannot ensure, because of the well-known trend towards decreasing profits.</p>

No one knows which market or which agency directs the reactions of the other; whether one country’s poor rating triggers panic over sovereign debt, or whether cynical speculation leads to a poor rating; whether a good rating has an impact on certain assets being held onto or whether, because they are good and one wants to hold onto them, the assets are rated favourably. Monitoring the activity of agencies more closely offers only a minimum service and obviously does not go far enough. Despite the repeated criticisms they have received in Europe and the US, the reputation of agencies has not really suffered.

As you know, CRAs rate three different sectors – the public sector, companies and structured finance instruments. There is an inherent conflict of interest if market participants devise internal credit risk assessments for their own regulatory capital requirements. I see the need to increase supervisors’ responsibilities, capacity, powers and resources for monitoring, assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models and for imposing prudential measures. I believe that credit ratings must serve the purpose of increasing information to the market in a manner that provides investors with a consistent assessment of credit risk across sectors and countries, and consider it important to enable users to better scrutinise CRAs. In this respect, it is necessary to highlight the central role of increased transparency in their activities.

Lastly, we support the idea of establishing a fully-independent, non-public European Credit Rating Foundation (ECRF).</p>

      <p sl="fr">This hypocritical text claims that the main problem with credit rating agencies is that they hamper competition. Its solution to the ‘over-reliance’ of banks on these agencies is that the banks assess the risks themselves. Banks responsible for measuring austerity! If they are unable to do so, they are asked to apply the least favourable rating to offer themselves the greatest protection. The problem is not protecting the interests of banks but protecting the general interest. Once again, the people are last on the EU’s list of priorities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Credit rating agencies (CRAs) fulfil several useful purposes: they aggregate information on the credit quality of issuers, enabling issuers to access global and domestic markets, reducing information costs and widening the potential pool of investors, thus providing markets with liquidity. However, the recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the industry: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs. We must pay attention to the potential measures to be taken. These should undergo the necessary impact assessments and scrutiny, and should not be a shot from the hip, which could be counterproductive, increasing the barriers to entry into the markets and the risk of more conservative ratings, with subsequent effects on the real economy and lending. We must view this industry from a global perspective, as it is a true worldwide industry with an underlying global capital market. We must therefore stay up-to-date with developments in the United States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Credit rating agencies are supposed to provide information about the quality of credit. Hitherto, however, these agencies have earned themselves a dishonourable reputation. Thus, for example, their delayed reaction to the financial crisis of the 1930s was roundly criticised. The experts in the credit rating agencies even failed to spot the rotten financial structures in the US property market as a risk. Likewise, when state debts began to rise, they only reacted when investors started to express their worries, responding with such harshness that the financial problems of individual countries were exacerbated. There is something terribly wrong with the system as a whole if the Greek irregularities and the Goldman-Sachs swap to conceal debt were known in the market for many years, if it was common for Athens to revise its budget data as soon as a new government came to power and the state was still given a good credit rating, only provoking a sudden, sharp response when the financial and economic crisis happened, causing bankruptcies, penalising states whose banks backed precarious loans, while, at the same time, betting a lot of money on countries going bankrupt. This proposal can only be the first step in the right direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it.</p>

      <p sl="de">I believe that the activities of credit rating agencies are generally extremely dubious. This is not just because they do not identify risks in good time, as in the case of the US real estate market, but also because they can make a bad situation worse after a crisis occurs. We cannot allow private US rating agencies to decide arbitrarily on the creditworthiness of European states.

      <p sl="lt">I welcome this resolution on the future perspectives of credit rating agencies. The credit rating industry often experiences problems relating to oligopolistic structures and a lack of competition, accountability and transparency. Consequently, the Commission should consider the possibility of establishing a completely new, independent European Credit Rating Foundation (ECRF), which would have the right to participate in decisions on sovereign debt ratings and credit rating agencies. The management, staff and governance structure of the new ECRF would be fully independent and autonomous. I welcome the proposal that CRAs’ exposure to civil liability in the event of gross negligence or misconduct be defined on a consistent basis across the EU. Furthermore, there is a need to increase supervisors’ responsibilities, capacity, powers and resources for monitoring, assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models, for imposing prudential measures and conducting investigations and inspections. It is very important to create a level playing field for credit rating agencies by stimulating competition, transparency, market opening and stability.</p>

It is vital that the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) exercises its powers effectively and has the right to conduct unannounced investigations and on-site inspections. It is also vital that, when exercising its supervisory powers, the ESMA gives the persons subject to proceedings the opportunity of a hearing in order to respect their right to defence.

      <p sl="pt">The recent financial crisis has demonstrated the need to regulate credit rating agencies (CRAs). Indeed, recent events have opened up the possibility of identifying the failures of their action and of re-examining their status as certifiers of the subjects of their analysis: companies, the public sector, and structured finance instruments. As such, it has become clear that they play an important role in reducing the asymmetries in information that could be detected between investors. On the other hand, however, it has been noted that there is too much confidence in the ratings assigned by CRAs, which surely contributed significantly to exacerbating the financial crisis. There is, therefore, an urgent need for a new regulatory model that will reduce dependence on CRA ratings. The solution involves measures such as limiting the dependence of the European Central Bank (ECB) on data provided by outside agencies, reinforcing the competences of regulators and supervisors, launching the debate on creating a European Credit Rating Foundation, increasing the range of information available to investors – thereby decreasing the CRAs’ power – and also, for example, strengthening mechanisms for civil accountability.</p>

Another controversial issue is the structure to be put forward to counterbalance the three largest rating agencies at European level, which are felt to have a disproportionate influence on our market. Hence, I call on the Commission to carefully assess the opportunity for a completely independent credit rating foundation, which should be provided with seed funds to cover a maximum of five years.</p>

These services have a massive impact and the results of their activities may be catastrophic for the states and organisations which they rate, as we saw very clearly in the recent financial crisis. Clear operating rules need to be laid down for these services, the rating procedures they use need to be disclosed and they need to take responsibility. The states and all manner of services and organisations which they rate cannot be left at the mercy of their decisions. The three principal rating agencies rate 95% of economic activities; we are therefore talking about a monopoly, with all the adverse repercussions that can have.

Credit rating agencies were earning fees, from financial institutions, for awarding ratings on their products, and from the resulting business of selling those products. This conflict meant agencies were keen to give high ratings to complex financial instruments, which led to investor complacency when buying these products. Agencies were also advising companies on ways to present their higher-risk products as low risk, and this misleading practice meant that these products turned out to be more toxic than their rating would suggest and led to huge losses for investors, including pension holders across Wales.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Having a homogenous formula for a social clause that could be inserted in all bilateral trade agreements is what is proposed in the report that we have just adopted on the external dimension of social policy and the promotion of social standards. This initiative is actually a step in the right direction. Observing the fact that free trade agreements still generally contain few references to social standards, the report mentions a number of avenues, including the social clause and compliance with International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions – whether or not they have been ratified already by all Member States. – and enhancing cooperation between third countries and Member States. Developing the concept of corporate social responsibility is the other interesting aspect of the report because, although it is currently a useful concept, it is still based on voluntary participation and therefore has room for improvement. As well as extending the concept to several areas and incorporating this CSA dimension into our trade polices, why not one day make it binding? Over and above political signalling, this would be a real step forward in achieving our social policy objectives.</p>

      <p sl="it">The external dimension of social policy includes the European Union’s initiatives to promote labour and social standards in non-Member States. By setting labour standards, the European Union fosters the possibility for citizens to obtain work in conditions of freedom, equality, safety and dignity. Considering the present globalisation of the world economy, international labour standards are the foundation on which a country’s social and economic development should be built. China, India and other emerging economies are becoming increasingly important players in terms of foreign investments. This phenomenon is nevertheless associated with the risk that these countries – and, in particular, their companies – will export labour standards below those of the European Union. I therefore believe that the European Union should be watchful of countries that wish to conclude trade agreements with us.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises lead the way in translating social standards into reality. I take the view that it is vital to have a clear and unambiguous definition of corporate social responsibility that will do away with the current assortment of interpretations, while also establishing ways to check that these responsibilities are met.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because there are still cases where the conventions and agreements of the International Labour Organisation are not properly implemented or only partially implemented and the principles of corporate social responsibility are violated. International labour standards should, above all, ensure workers’ rights, because work is a part of our daily lives and is critical for the dignity, welfare and development of a person. As well as social standards, corporate social responsibility should contribute to sustainable growth, but companies should not avoid dialogue with employees and they must respect and promote decent employment relations, encourage employee participation through consultation and information and through collective bargaining, develop vocational skills and lifelong learning, comply with work safety standards, promote equality of men and women, create a proper environment for social partners to anticipate and manage changes that have taken place in the labour market, including restructuring, improve the quality of work, and integrate and protect vulnerable groups of workers, such as young people, the elderly, disabled people and migrants. The European Union should therefore continue to use sanctions and incentives in bilateral and regional agreements in order to ensure the implementation of the social provisions of EU agreements. Furthermore, it is very important for the governments themselves not to retreat from their responsibility to maintain the European social model because then, there is the threat of the privatisation of employment law and social security systems and services.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The external dimension of social policy includes EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries. Although both the Lisbon strategy and the EU 2020 strategy attach greater emphasis than ever before to social policy, the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority to the detriment of social issues. Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions which focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order for the EU to negotiate with third countries, they must comply with all the abovementioned requirements. This is a mandatory condition for negotiations with third countries.

      <p sl="cs">The report focuses on a topic that is enormously important in today’s world. This is the question of workers’ rights. So-called social dumping represents a major threat for workers as it undermines their rights in a fundamental way. International companies are the main players when it comes to applying social standards. It is therefore absolutely essential to define the social responsibility of companies clearly and unambiguously so that we can limit the number of differing interpretations and establish minimum obligations in this area, as well as a method for monitoring their fulfilment. Many firms come into regions only for the temporary financial advantage, mostly because of cheap labour. Companies generally refuse to establish long-term links in a region, and therefore to participate in shared social responsibility in the region. The report calls for the strengthening of basic employment standards, which are enshrined in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in the workplace and the abolition of child labour. It demands changes in the global administration system and in the EU, with the aim of better protection of workers’ rights and employment conditions.

This is because, in my opinion, the EU should refrain from imposing social prerogatives on third countries, however correct or beneficial they may deem them to be. Whilst I accept the importance of fostering humane methods of treating a workforce, social policy in the EU has already wreaked havoc on a number of UK institutions and should not be extended. A degree of flexibility and freedom is needed when dealing with social policy, as one-size-fits-all policy making can be counterproductive when applied at domestic level. For this reason, the EU should not be seeking to acquire competence over social policy at all.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The International Labour Organisation (ILO) plays a key role in the international system, as it contributes to building a consensus on labour standards. A significant part of this important acquis is recognised by all EU Member States. However, there remain differences in terms of labour legislation between developed and developing countries. In my opinion, it is imperative for the EU that these standards with those of third countries be reconciled, particularly with key trade partners, so as to preserve a basic level of equality in international trade. This report shares this belief, setting out some strategies for these countries to respect the same principles as the EU in labour terms. The establishment of fair standards for working conditions is a premise essential to durable and sustainable development, and will also contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I therefore believe that this report is a fairly valid contribution to the development of the system of international trade, which is based on labour relations that vary so much between countries/trade blocs. I would argue that the promotion of this policy of responsibility for working conditions demonstrates a Europe that is attentive and thorough, and that conforms to defending universal values in which it believes.</p>

      <p sl="it">One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development. If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place. This perspective – which some people also call the social market economy – is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being. Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy, including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility. This approach and vision cannot, and must not, have an impact merely within the EU, but must also be applied to external action wherever possible, particularly during the negotiation of agreements. Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions. I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report by Mr Falbr concerns the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility. The European Union has been a bastion of the defence of workers’ social rights, respect for which is a sine qua non for negotiations with third countries. Despite the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, according to the ILO itself, more than 50% of workers do not enjoy social rights, in particular, immigrants, women and children. It is in the EU’s interests to promote personal dignity and respect for social rights in all the Member States, creating, for that purpose, a mechanism for finding out who is not offering these rights to their workers and penalising them. I welcome this report and am voting for it. Whilst arguing for the importance of values in a globalising world increasingly dominated by economics, it advocates personal dignity, does not accept the exploitation of individuals, promotes welfare and personal integrated development, and calls on the EU to comply with ILO standards.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This is yet another enunciation of just concerns and criticisms that, unfortunately, does not get to the bottom of the issues and, for this very reason, ends up being largely inconsequential.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The 2010 World Social Security Report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) mentions that more than 50% of workers lack social protection. It is in this context that the European Union is implementing a trade policy based on the zealous championing of free trade, which is achieved through the negotiation and conclusion of innumerable bilateral and regional agreements. Far from encouraging ‘corporate social responsibility’, which is, in practice, non-existent, these agreements only protect the profits of large companies and financial institutions, and do not give the proper attention to labour rights, to the importance of collective bargaining and workers’ freedom of association, to the effective elimination of discrimination in respect of employment, to the elimination of forced labour, to insecure and poorly paid work, or to child labour.</p>

When have we ever taken practical and specific action as a consequence of coming across situations of intolerable exploitation? When have such situations ever prevented the signing of trade agreements with a country? Never. Because while you pretend to be concerned about foreign workers, European workers are being excluded from the picture. As the rapporteur – who subscribes to this – points out, ‘labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes’ according to the international bodies!

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because, at the turn of the century, the EU changed its strategy for the external dimension of social policy from a hard to a soft approach, i.e. from focusing on linking social standards with trade agreements to focusing rather on international cooperation and dialogue. The EU uses different types of instruments to implement social policy in non-member countries. These are hard, soft and financial instruments. The use of these instruments is proof that the EU expects certain behaviour in its relations with its trading partners. Nevertheless, the stumbling block is the implementation of these instruments and their enforcement in partner countries. It is therefore crucial for the EU to focus more thoroughly on their implementation and enforcement, especially the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and the principles of corporate social responsibility. This is often hindered by the country’s legal order; however, weak political will and internal economic pressure are also at play. The fact that workers do not know their rights is another important factor.</p>

The promotion of high labour standards, social standards and corporate social responsibility represents an extremely large challenge for the external dimension of social policy. One of the problems which the rapporteur highlights is the inefficiency of the administrative bodies responsible for employment policy. Ongoing and constructive cooperation with third countries, involving both the European Union as a whole and the individual Member States, may serve as a source of good practices in terms of establishing the appropriate administrative capabilities. I believe that cooperation at regional and local levels and with businesses also yields good results. An excellent example of partnership, support and exchange of experience which has yielded positive results is the cooperation between Polish regions and the countries in the Eastern Partnership over the last few years.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the resolution on the external dimension of the European Union’s social policy. The European Union is seen around the world as an attractive and sought-after partner, and this owes much to the unique way in which it combines economic dynamism with a social model. The latter should be promoted by the EU in its relations with other countries and should involve consistent action between the two dimensions, internal and external. The current text insists on the need to promote corporate social responsibility in particular. The latter requires trading companies to take into consideration the social and environmental dimensions. The resolution highlights that this promotion should not be binding, but rather should be the result of interaction between the stakeholders on a voluntary basis. Finally it is also aimed at incorporating within international negotiations the rights of workers, which the International Labour Organisation is tasked with defending, as well as promoting a global economic governance that takes these parameters into account.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome this report. Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the abolition of child labour. It is clear not only from these conventions but also from the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation that it is necessary to change the narrow focus on markets into a wider interest in people, i.e. focus on the protection of workers’ rights and the rule of labour law. In order for the EU to negotiate with non-member countries, the latter must respect all the abovementioned. This is a condition without which negotiations with non-member countries are impossible. Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers' rights, and the development of society may therefore only continue after these drawbacks are removed. By setting labour standards, the EU supports opportunities for men and women to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equality, security and dignity. Given the current globalisation, international labour standards are the basis which guarantees that the growth of the global economy will benefit all.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The aim and much of the content of Mr Falbr’s report is, in my view, very positive. I also consider the focus on employment and decent working conditions to be a key element of sustainable development, and not just in EU countries. Like the rapporteur, I regret that there is no single definition of a ‘social clause’ which would be usable not in bilateral trade agreements, but in the creation of decent employment conditions for workers. The social models of some European countries could also serve as a good example to developing countries. I also share the opinion on the joint fight to eliminate child labour.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Despite the above, I abstained from the vote because it is impossible to implement social demands in bilateral trade agreements in the absence of a clear definition of respect for human rights. This criterion must not be used as an argument against the signing of agreements.</p>

      <p sl="it">‘That the spirit of revolutionary change which has long been disturbing the nations of the world should have passed beyond the sphere of politics and made its influence felt in the related sphere of practical economics is not surprising’. These are the words of the beloved Pope John Paul II who, in his encyclical entitled Centesimus Annus , reprised the subjects tackled by his predecessor Leo XIII in the encyclical Rerum Novarum . His purpose in doing so was to analyse and contribute to the social ‘question’ which – today as in 1991 – can only be resolved by referring to Christian doctrine and, hence, by recognising the absolutely indiscriminate dignity of the human being and the worker.</p>
      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Falbr since it focuses precisely on the importance of safeguarding human rights and the fact that the European social model is an important starting point, including in terms of the Union’s external relations. Social responsibility must work to this end and the European Union – working through Parliament – must restore and reinforce these principles in its every action, above all in dealing with non-Member States whose citizens are denied fundamental rights. As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I feel compelled to underline how important it is that we all cooperate, including outside the EU, to eliminate gender discrimination and gender violence so as to restore the social dignity of women and revive their active contribution to the local and supranational economy alike.</p>

We already have countless trade agreements that make no demands in terms of adherence to social standards. As long as this obvious discrepancy exists, the effectiveness and rationale of this report will necessarily be limited. The report calls on the Member States to implement core labour law standards for businesses in their own countries. Should not this also extend to businesses outside of Europe?

      <p sl="pl">In connection with the above, all Member States concluding agreements with third countries should ensure that their position aligns with the European social model. We should demand that countries not wishing to join the EU respect the right of association and that they take steps to prevent discrimination on the grounds of gender or age. The elimination of child labour and citizens’ right to improve their professional qualifications are very significant issues. As far as development cooperation is concerned, the European Union has enough funds to create sufficient structures in the field of vocational education and training. It is absolutely crucial for the European Commission to make adjustments for the current situation and realities of life in the country in question when negotiating partnership agreements. The European Parliament has gained new competences since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and it should cooperate actively with European and international trade unions in order to improve the social situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Promoting labour standards through the EU’s negotiations with third party countries benefits both the Member States and the third party countries. By promoting higher safety standards and better pay, the EU is helping improve workers’ lives. By insisting on better pay, the EU is also ensuring that there is a market in third party countries for EU exports. If we allow imports into Europe from countries that do not ensure fair wages, we are effectively pricing European companies out of the market. It is harder for EU companies to compete with third party countries who do not observe the same safety standards and who can pay employees much lower salaries. However, it is important to note the dangers involved in ‘soft law’ approaches to labour standards. As well as the fact that such rules are not binding and that there is no sanction if they are breached, it also risks reducing traditional supervisory systems in favour of informal monitoring procedures. Therefore, the EU must be vigilant and ensure that standards are adhered to and, if not, then action must be taken.</p>

The report proposes, among other things, that minimum requirements for corporate social responsibility be laid down by means of a legal framework, that the term be better defined and that fulfilment of the requirements be better monitored. At the same time, the report rejects the use in trade agreements of the ‘MODE4 process’, which allows international companies to import their own labour force, thereby circumventing the host country’s social and working conditions. Quite apart from the fact that this puts the imported labour force in a worse position than that of the host country, it also contributes to social dumping. The EU currently has the power to enter into trade agreements with third countries on behalf of all of the Member States of the EU. I am opposed to this.

The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy. There is a growing need for mobile, flexible employees with international experience. Especially where young people are concerned, action needs to be taken immediately: youth unemployment is one of Europe’s most pressing challenges. Member States must adopt targeted political strategies to combat poverty, taking into account specific national circumstances and needs. I agree with the provision laid down in the resolution that the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, namely, to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level, must be tackled by means of specific, creative and effective measures. Given that demographic changes are fuelling the need for training and adding to the necessity to participate in lifelong learning, workers must be provided with a means of determining and planning their own training needs. Furthermore, in order to enable people at different times of life and specific groups to have access to vocational education and training, financing opportunities should be broadened, simplified and made more readily available under the Lifelong Learning Programme and by implementing Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs. We must ensure that Europe’s workers are able to adapt to the requirements of the economy.</p>

      <p sl="el">This despicable report maps the EU’s strategic aim to come out on top in the competition for the monopolies with other imperialist centres, by promoting the integration of education into the quantifiable targets of the reactionary EU 2020 strategy which need to be ‘transformed’ into national targets. Within the framework of this global plan, particular attention is given to technical and vocational education, which is allocated the role of serving the needs of the cheapest possible, disenfranchised workforce worthy of the ‘labour market’ and ‘competitiveness’. That is why education and training courses must meet both current and future market needs. Subjugation to the choices and plans of the capitalist undertaking must be strengthened, while ‘employability’ and entry to the labour market via apprenticeship, mobility in sectors of the economy and so-called accessibility between levels of education and training must be facilitated. Pronouncements about ‘equal opportunities’ and ‘free choice’ and satisfaction of the needs of young people conceal adaptation to the needs of the capitalist economy, which means a policy of class barriers in education adapted to the mediaeval labour practices of the ‘memoranda’ and of EU 2020.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The economic crisis has turned the European Union labour market completely upside down. There is no large business area which has been left unscathed by the damaging consequences of this crisis, with the effects reaching the level of the citizen in the form of job insecurity, unemployment and poor conditions or opportunities for finding new employment. Vocational education and training are proving, in this context, to be a new opportunity, a new way of enabling European citizens’ lives to return to normal. I am alarmed by the high youth unemployment rate. I believe that with the right education and ongoing training, many young people in Europe will manage to find themselves a well-paid job, appropriate to their vocational training or retraining. I congratulate the rapporteur for this dossier. I conclude, along with Nadja Hirsch, that if we want to fulfil these wishes, vocational education and training need to be clearly results-orientated. There must be one objective for 2020: every young person must have a job.</p>

With regret, I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States. Without a coordinated initiative that brings together the sectors of vocational training, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market, I do not see how we can manage to ensure that we will achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy entitled ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy. There is a growing need for mobile, flexible employees with international experience. The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge, innovation and education, and promoting the digital society), sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness), and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty). What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States. Action needs to be taken immediately, especially where the level of youth unemployment is concerned. It is not just that the unemployment rate is higher among young workers than among their adult counterparts: young people are also to be found more frequently in temporary jobs with lower pay and less social security cover. I agree that in order to fully realise the EU 2020 flagship initiative ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’, the EU institutions should embark on a more pragmatic, comprehensive and wide-ranging initiative supported by all Member States which should focus on connecting the areas of vocational education, professional qualifications, lifelong learning, apprenticeships and the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU is experiencing a severe economic, financial and social crisis. The consequences of this crisis have been primarily felt in the field of employment. There are currently 22.82 million unemployed people in the European Union. Young people under the age of 25 continue to be the worst hit, with unemployment at 21.3% in this age range. On the one hand, it is estimated that, by 2020, almost 15.6 million new jobs will be created for highly qualified people, but, on the other hand, 12 million jobs for people with few or no qualifications will be lost. The Europe 2020 strategy aims to respond to these new prospects for the professional world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report stresses the need to develop European-level cooperation in the field of vocational education and training to increase transparency and for ease of comparison between the various education systems.

      <p sl="fr">While youth unemployment is currently 21% in the European Union, and close to 25% in my country, this has become a major challenge for Europe at a time when young Europeans deprived of employment are threatened with social exclusion and poverty. The EU only has marginal responsibility on these issues. However, it seems that it can offer, if not solutions, at least interesting food for thought: it appears obvious to me that training and education should be at the heart of the political priorities of today and of tomorrow. The report calls on Member States to exchange good practices regarding their vocational education system and training systems combined with work experience, which should be extended in many Member States, particularly in France. These recommendations are going in the right direction to improve education and training in connection with the labour market and to reduce unemployment and social exclusion, but they will not be enough if Member States and the Commission do not make sufficient efforts at a time when youth unemployment is becoming the major political challenge in many Member States, particularly in my country, France.</p>

      <p sl="it">In today’s globalised economy, the possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life for European citizens. In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, industrial and technological change increases the need for workers with high and intermediate skill levels. As far as vocational education and training are concerned, the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level. To attain these goals, it is essential for education and vocational training to be treated as a long-term common political priority, which can only be realised with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders, the EU institutions and those involved at local and regional level.</p>
      <p sl="it">At this point, I would emphasise that action needs to be taken quickly, especially where young people are concerned: the rise in youth unemployment is, in fact, one of Europe’s most pressing challenges. The aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy – namely, to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level – must be tackled with efficient and practical measures.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the age of a Europe without borders, education is a fundamental step in planning the professional lives of citizens, particularly at international level. Young people should be able to take advantage of the opportunities to acquire knowledge and experience provided by membership of their country in the European Union. The ever greater demand for mobile workers who have received a broad education is a further factor in favour of this lifestyle. In view of the above, unemployment among young people remains a worrying problem. The implementation of projects aimed at combating this hazardous phenomenon is an urgent issue. Every investment made in education helps to ensure a better future for young people. The use of European funds to launch concrete programmes in the field of vocational education and development is therefore particularly important. I thus agree with the need to develop instruments supporting ‘lifelong learning’ or, in other words, the regular improvement of qualifications. Creative and effective educational programmes should make it possible to accomplish one of the overriding objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, namely, to ensure that at least 40% of people complete higher education.</p>

It also emphasises the importance, at local and regional level, of fostering effective cooperation between schools, training agencies, research centres and firms, in order to overcome the inward-looking nature of education systems and the mismatch between knowledge and skills and the needs of the labour market. I agree that in order to modernise training and education, we must strengthen the link between potential employers and schools, and therefore the inclusion of social partners in curriculum development would be another step towards greater employment in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Europe 2020 strategy states that the key factors for smart growth are not only fostering knowledge, innovation, and education, and promoting the digital society, but also sustainable and inclusive growth. The key to achieving these, in this case, is vocational education and training, for which all Member States must adopt the same standards. In spite of the severe impact which the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover, at least gradually, over the next 10 years. The projections suggest that the demand for skills will continue to rise. Industrial and technological change increases the demand for workers with high and intermediate skill levels, with low-skilled labour being squeezed out.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There is ever-increasing emphasis on a clear, results-orientated learning approach. Reforms have already been implemented in vocational education systems in some Member States.

      <p sl="ro">Vocational education and training measures are absolutely essential for turning the European economy into a knowledge economy, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy objectives. This is why I fully support the recommendations made by this report, which highlight the importance of investment in vocational education and training for the European economy’s future competitiveness. We need effective measures, complementing each other at national and European level, in order to achieve our objectives. There has been an alarming rise in the youth unemployment rate in the EU. This report sends out a clear message: vocational education and training are key factors in tackling youth unemployment. Clear strategies are needed to facilitate their inclusion in the labour market, which will encourage the correlation between education programmes and the demands of the labour market, so that it can take up the graduates.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The required approach must put the emphasis on specific skills so as to facilitate integration into the labour market. Furthermore, due to the constant technological changes, employers have ever-increasing expectations with regard to employees’ qualifications. This is why ongoing training plays a key role in constantly adapting vocational qualifications to the demands of the economy. This can help people avoid being excluded from the labour market at some time during their career.</p>

      <p sl="el">The report as a whole is driven by the philosophy of linking vocational education and training to the needs of the market and of businesses within the EU 2020 strategy, a strategy which further erodes the social fabric and workers’ rights. Although there are some positive references to general principles of ‘humanising work’ and promoting creativity and the need for accessible pathways from informal to formal learning, they are all stale dead letter which simply embellish a report which, in the final analysis, promotes neoliberalism in every procedure and at every stage of education and training, even at the highest level.</p>
      <p sl="el">For example, it calls on the Member States to support doctoral and post-doctoral programmes that will underpin competitiveness and to facilitate ‘labour mobility’, commonly known as job insecurity. Finally, one of the most important disadvantages of the report is that it calls for the Member States to ensure ‘mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas among the Member States’, thereby putting pressure on them to recognise diplomas from various Greek or foreign colleges as ‘equivalent’ to a degree from a State university.

      <p sl="pt">There is currently a tragic situation in a number of Member States as regards unemployment rates, especially amongst young people, for whom the current rate of unemployment is double the general EU rate of unemployment.

It is essential that the Member States adopt political strategies aimed at combating this problem that are based on the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% per year, and of enabling at least 40% of young people to complete higher education. These must be tackled with concrete, creative and effective measures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately, I would say that the Europe 2020 strategy’s ambitions are not visibly in harmony with the reality of budget restrictions, which have substantially cut funding for the main EU programmes in the area of education. I welcome the measures adopted by the Commission aimed at facilitating accessibility, transparency and comparability for the purposes of the recognition process within and among education systems. It is also important that the Member States start reforming their systems, and gear vocational education and training towards the true needs of the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="it">In an effort to encourage European cooperation to support the Europe 2020 strategy, I would like to give my full backing to three points highlighted in this report. Firstly, I strongly support the need to improve dialogue between the labour market and the educational system by increasing the number of traineeships available in businesses, in order to enable students to become actively involved in the business world and also to strengthen links between businesses and educational institutions with regard to vocational training. I also think it is a good idea to integrate educational systems more at international level, firstly, to ensure that people’s qualifications are fully recognised, and secondly, to promote cross-border mobility projects. Finally, I fully agree with Parliament’s suggestion to the Commission to make the necessary adjustments to the European Social Fund, Erasmus and the Lifelong Learning Programme in order to ensure that funding can be allocated to specific education and training projects, and to projects to tackle youth unemployment and gender discrimination, with more women being encouraged to take part in those projects.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report aims to strengthen measures of cooperation between Member States by encouraging vocational education and training that is mutually recognised, of a better quality, more geared towards the needs of the labour market and more accessible to all. This report also reminds us of the need for a strategy for the future of education and, above all, for guidance on all the professional needs that Europe will have in the near future. In particular, the report warns of the need for stronger links within the European education and training system; for a system in which transparency, and mutual recognition of skills and aptitudes are, in fact, a reality. It seems obvious to me that in an increasingly unified Europe in which mobility is a growing reality, the mutual recognition of qualifications is absolutely essential. However, this requires the transposition of Union legislation in these areas, as this report warns. In the face of this new situation in Europe, education and training is becoming the basis and tool for a successful future. Promoting mobility, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation is an objective necessity and should be encouraged by the EU, as the report points out.

It is essential to give young Europeans the tools necessary for them to be able to compete in a globalised world and for them to be able to enter the labour market using their knowledge and skills. We cannot forget that youth unemployment figures are overwhelming throughout Europe. However, we should be aware that more training often does not correspond to more opportunities in the labour market. Cases of young graduates, with additional training and postgraduate training, but without a job and without prospects of finding one, are multiplying in the EU. Training must be geared towards the needs of the market and prepare young workers. In my opinion, this paradigm shift will be vital in stopping the growth of unemployment amongst younger people and in guaranteeing them a future with more possibilities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This is yet another tedious repetition of the European Commission’s standard rhetoric on issues of lifelong learning and promotion of mobility at EU level, which are considered the best guarantee of improving workers’ ‘employability’ and ‘adaptability’. Vocational training is viewed here as a means of promoting ‘entrepreneurship’ and of responding to the need to ‘create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow’, adding that ‘to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments’. It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely ‘to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report’s ideological framework suddenly becomes clear: the problem of employment is a problem for the individual and not an eminently social one, with the individual – and not society – having to solve it, whether by increasing their ‘employability’ or by becoming an ‘entrepreneur’; a tax system that is profit-friendly and, therefore, imposed mainly on workers and consumers; and education and training totally at the beck and call of capital. As for the rest, it does not examine the causes in depth, or seek solutions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report repeats the European Commission’s standard rhetoric on issues of lifelong learning and promotion of mobility at EU level, which are considered to be the best guarantee against unemployment, and the need for workers to improve their ‘employability’ and ‘adaptability’, so as to organise the supply of education and training.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to ‘create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow’, adding that ‘to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments’. It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely ‘to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it’. In other words, what the report does is put education and training fully at the beck and call of European capitalism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, it fails to mention the social reasons that lead to early school drop-out, to a lack of access to higher education opportunities and to youth unemployment, just so as to mask the responsibility of the neoliberal policies promoted by large companies and financial institutions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that professional education and training should be available and affordable on a lifelong basis, regardless of a person’s position on the labour market or their income. Access to professional education should respond to the particular needs of individuals, and thus make it easier for them to find a job. It is necessary to create opportunities for specific groups in EU Member States, such as unemployed young people, ethnic minorities, vulnerable women, people with disabilities and others, in order to achieve better social integration and better social cohesion. Last but not least, extended, simplified and more accessible funding options would undoubtedly assist the successful implementation of the above aims.</p>

      <p sl="it">With this report, we are adding another element to the European strategy on youth policy. It is right to support the internationalisation of studies together with job flexibility among young workers in an increasingly competitive labour market. Europe’s young people must be given the opportunity to compete with their contemporaries from the four corners of the globe. Youth unemployment figures cannot leave us indifferent. We should welcome this report, which emphasises the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives: to combat youth unemployment through efficient and effective measures such as, for example, reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensuring that at least 40% of young people are educated to university level. However, this should not be a finishing line but a starting point: future priorities should be to establish links between universities and businesses and to bring back compulsory traineeships / apprenticeships funded by public or private bodies. We do not have much time to play with and we must act now. Otherwise, the legacy we leave to future generations will be a very heavy one.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Young people are the first victims of unemployment and are very prone to dropping out of school. This is why it is imperative to modernise curricula and training so that they are more closely tailored to the needs of our companies.

Achieving these objectives will only be possible if all stakeholders (European institutions, Member States, local and regional players) join forces.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because Europe needs to take action immediately, especially where young people are concerned: rising youth unemployment is one of Europe’s most pressing challenges. It is not just that the unemployment rate is higher among young workers than among their adult counterparts: young people are also to be found more frequently in insecure temporary jobs with lower pay and less social security cover. Member States must adopt targeted political strategies to combat poverty, taking into account specific national circumstances and needs. The aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, namely, to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level, must be tackled by means of specific, creative and effective measures. Vocational education and training have to be treated as a long-term common political priority, which can be translated into reality only with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders: as well as the EU institutions and the Member States, those involved at local and regional level must use their influence to make this happen. We must ensure that Europe’s workers are able to adapt to the requirements of the economy. Policy makers must enable people to improve and broaden their skills. Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs, upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and, hence, contribute actively to an innovative economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to welcome this report which draws attention to the necessity of broadening the system of vocational training in the EU since equal access to quality lifelong learning means better chances in the labour market and thereby contributes to fulfilment of the goals of the EU’s 2020 strategy. Special emphasis must be put on preventing youth unemployment, for which it is necessary to harmonise training supply with labour-market demand, provide middle-term national and regional forecasts on expected labour demand and enable national education systems to be more effective in guaranteeing the attainment of those skills that are actively sought on the labour market. According to Cedefop, we can expect a 12 million decline in jobs available for low skilled or unskilled labour, which presages an increasing risk of poverty for the most vulnerable. In many cases, even those who finish school are unable to enter the labour market and therefore are more likely to engage themselves in casual work or work in the black economy. Consequently, they are unable to start a life on their own and often become an unbearable burden on households, creating a vicious circle of unsatisfactory education and joblessness.</p>

Let us emphasise that these should be jobs with good conditions and decent pay.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to forecasts, economic problems will not change the fact that employment levels are rising in the EU, and should not give rise to a reduction in funding for the EU’s key programmes in the field of vocational education and training, such as the ‘Lifelong Learning’ programme, for example. These funds should, in fact, be increased, so that everyone, regardless of their age, gender or location, has access to the same opportunities in terms of vocational education and careers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As shadow rapporteur for the Hirsch report on European cooperation in vocational education and training, I would like to explain why I voted in favour of adopting this report. In the current situation, when ageing societies, on the one hand, and an alarmingly high rate of unemployment among young people, on the other, mean that Europe is faced with very serious challenges, vocational education and training have a fundamental role to play. When endeavouring to secure future support for vocational education and training, we should therefore, at the same time, attach the greatest importance to monitoring the effectiveness of training and to an approach focused on achieving the goal of increasing employment levels and social integration.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is my belief that vocational education and training must be closely linked with the labour market, a characteristic feature of which is constant adaptation to economic, demographic and social changes. In my opinion, ensuring that the ESF is managed more flexibly and that this fund complements other European employment instruments and domestic measures is an extremely important issue. Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a successful and comprehensive report, and to thank her for her excellent cooperation.</p>

That is why the Copenhagen process which, since 2002, has been laying the foundations of greater cooperation in terms of the Member States’ policies with regard to vocational education and training, is particularly important.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of Mrs Hirsch’s report. In order to face the economic challenges of the 21st century and, in particular, the growing competition of our trading partners, European systems for vocational education and training have an obligation to be more effective, more attractive and more reactive, in order to better prepare our fellow citizens to the jobs that need filling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must therefore work towards tailoring these systems to the needs of the world of work. I think there is also a need to facilitate access to high quality work experience in Europe and, therefore, to preserve and strengthen the existing programmes aimed at increasing apprentices’ mobility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Setting up a real ‘Erasmus for apprentices’, that is the commitment I undertook during the 2009 European election campaign: this is about the young and the not so young, while putting a foot in the world of work and gaining work experience, having the opportunity to travel within Europe and having direct contact with the economic realities of our Internal Market.</p>

I am talking, however, about high-quality education built on the concept of modern teaching elements, about education made attractive in a specific way and showing the need for a given field of education, with a view to other options for boosting qualifications. The education process should result in professionally trained young people who have a clear idea of growth prospects and, first and foremost, who exploit their acquired knowledge, expertise and ability in the activity for which they have been trained and have acquired a qualification, the area of activity they have mastered and in respect of which they have shown an inclination.</p>

      <p sl="de">The world of work has undergone some major changes. While, in the past, a good education was a guarantee of a good job, these days, a higher education diploma or degree will not protect young people in particular from unemployment. In particular, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a start in one’s career. On the other hand, businesses are constantly complaining about the shortage of specialist staff, using this supposed shortage as an excuse to use cheap labour. The complete flexibility and mobility demanded, as well as the ‘bucket’ prices being imposed on the labour market in the form of new working models like ‘Mac-jobs’, make it impossible for many people to establish a family and to achieve a reasonable work-life balance. Within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, it may make sense to support the mutual recognition of education and training. However, the success of the strategy depends on taking steps to deal with these problematic developments.

      <p sl="en">One of the most pressing challenges in the current economic climate is that of youth unemployment. Not only is the unemployment rate higher among young workers than among the rest of the population, but young workers are often to be found in insecure temporary jobs with lower pay and weaker legal protection. It is vitally important we address this. The forecast by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) of growth of 80 million new jobs by 2020 is welcome. It is worth noting that there will be a shift towards industrial and technological development and a corresponding shift away from low-skilled labour. These new jobs will require workers with high and intermediate level skills. Action needs to be taken quickly to ensure that adequately skilled workers are available to fill these positions. With that in mind we must ensure that our approach to learning is focused on results. We must provide young people with access to lifelong learning and to courses with practical training elements to enable them to take up these jobs and to grow and progress in their careers. I believe these changes to vocational education will benefit the economies of all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">On the one hand, Europe is experiencing increased unemployment among young people and the insecure and temporary nature of the jobs young people normally do. On the other, however, it is also clear that companies lack qualified professionals whose training is geared towards the duties they should be performing. It is therefore important to seek to bring job supply in line with demand using measures such as, for example, independent advice on vocational training, making funds available for supporting vocational training, and competition between establishments providing said training. Ultimately, the aim is for people to be able to find a better job, but also, as the explanatory statement says, for them to have ‘the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future’.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today, we voted during the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy. In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover, at least gradually, over the next 10 years. As far as vocational education and training are concerned, the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level and in the Member States. If the goals indicated in the Europe 2020 strategy are to be attained, vocational education and training have to be treated as a key priority of the European Union institutions and those involved at local and regional level. Mrs Hirsch’s report embraces the Commission measures aimed at breaking down barriers, increasing transparency, and making for ease of comparison for the purposes of recognition within and between education systems, emphasising that it is important to ensure that education is geared more closely to the needs of the labour market, helping to boost creativity and innovation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The EU and the Member States should increase their efforts to encourage youth employment and reduce their unemployment rate, in particular, through improving the match between the training systems and the needs of the labour market. With the loss of 12 million low-skilled jobs in Europe by 2020, and the need for longer working lives to preserve our social model in the face of the demographic challenge, it is also crucial, at the same time, to step up the efforts for improving lifelong training of workers in the course of their career. In this respect, the idea of putting in place incentive mechanisms intended for employers so that they encourage their employees to participate in training programmes, suggested by Mrs Hirsch in this report, sounds interesting. In addition, in order to combat unemployment among low-skilled people, as well as to promote the employment of senior citizens, it is imperative to encourage the recognition of national qualifications between the Member States, and to encourage certification by validating skills acquired through informal apprenticeship.</p>

There is a growing need for mobile, flexible employees with international experience. The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge, innovation and education, and promoting the digital society), sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness), and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty). What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States to breathe life into the strategy. In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover, at least gradually, over the next ten years. According to Cedefop’s current Europe-wide skill supply and demand forecast, the number of new jobs up to 2020 is estimated at 80 million.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Education, vocational training and also the universal idea of ‘lifelong learning’ are the building blocks for the future of European integration, which is coming up against ever-new challenges in respect of support for the Europe 2020 strategy. We must face up to the fact that the level of unemployment among young people is increasing at an alarming rate. Problems associated with vocational education and training are becoming a priority for us. People at the start of their professional careers may find that unemployment has a negative effect on their further activity in the labour market. Vocational education and training make it possible to move around freely within the labour market, according to the changing economic situation and the demands of a particular economic sector. It is worth highlighting the usefulness and merits of existing cross-border educational programmes, for example, the Leonardo Da Vinci programme, which deserve our support. They make it possible for individuals to acquire the qualities which are characteristic of a mobile workforce.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mobility eliminates the difficulties which arise as a result of the natural diversity of the individual labour markets, and provides young workers with access to the enormous European labour market, full of new challenges and opportunities to make use of the experience they have gained. The Member States are faced with the task of facilitating supervision and assistance in respect of the establishment of cooperation and the exchange of information between schools, training institutions, research centres and businesses. Young workers bring new reserves of knowledge, skills and experience to the EU labour market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Youth unemployment in Europe is at 21% and currently affects more than 5.5 million young Europeans, who are at risk of social exclusion because of a lack of opportunities and are forced to accept insecure jobs. Training and education are the major challenges the European Union is currently facing, enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. The goals have been set of reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10% and enabling 40% of young people to complete higher education by 2020. These are fairly ambitious targets, but they are necessary for economic growth and for making the Member States more competitive, thereby creating jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I voted for this report, since I think it is essential to have a long-term, EU-level strategy that also enables structural unemployment and youth unemployment to be tackled. To this end, I think it is important to continue supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, since they create 50% of jobs, and to invest in continuous, lifelong learning. Finally, I should like to mention the need to recognise vocational qualifications, thereby facilitating the increased mobility of professionals and students.</p>

In order to address this problem, we need to invest more in the education and training of young people so that they are equipped for future challenges on the labour market, which is becoming more and more demanding. The report also quite rightly states that the European Social Fund could contribute more towards the education of the financially weak. Especially important, as I personally have stated on several occasions, is the proposal to facilitate labour mobility within the framework of the Internal Market. European cooperation to draft a single policy is needed in this sector. For all these reasons, I supported this particular report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The mismatch between young people’s qualifications and the needs of the labour market is one of the reasons why Lithuania has such a terribly high rate of youth unemployment (34%). In 2010, 52% of all unemployed young people (50 000) who registered with the Lithuanian Labour Exchange did not have any vocational training. The inability of my country’s young people to find suitable work has caused a huge wave of youth emigration – in the last few years, 50% of Lithuanian emigrants were aged 20-34. The need for a mobile and flexible workforce is growing and therefore, we must help Europe’s workforce to adapt to the needs of the economy, giving them the opportunity to improve their skills and enhance their knowledge. It is important for vocational training to be accessible to all people. I am pleased that the rapporteur understands this. ESF funding could be invaluable, helping to provide training for neglected groups in Lithuanian society. The time has also come for the EU to use effective and creative measures to implement the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, such as reducing the school drop-out rate to under 10% and ensuring that 40% of young people are educated to university level.</p>

Current unemployment levels, particularly among young people, are worrying and more needs to be done to ensure that young people are able to gain vital skills and qualifications. I strongly believe that the ESF has a valuable role to play in training and educating people.

Further simplification and adaptation to new challenges, such as climate change, as well as determining the external dimension of the EU’s internal policies, are important aspects that must be taken into consideration. I agree with the provision set out in the resolution that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms. The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0.7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015. The current level of European aid will have to increase significantly to achieve this aim. Coordination and division of labour must be the guiding principles of programming under the new development instrument. The idea of European strategy documents should be pursued as a matter of high priority, and the European Parliament must be actively involved in this process. Parliament must have the opportunity to defend the specificity of the EU’s development policy in the post-2013 development cooperation instrument by scrutinising strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) is one of the European Union’s extremely altruistic projects, intended to provide assistance to developing countries without any conditions or ulterior interests. The lack of any utilitarian aspect to the EU’s involvement must force its institutions to target these funds much better and focus on eradicating poverty and complying with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must stress the need for greater transparency for all funds earmarked for this purpose and, more importantly, for increasing the assessments of the impact which the DCI has among the population in those countries. This is because these funds must be backed up by effective social policies implemented in developing countries. These funds must be, in the medium and long term, the ‘rod’ which the relevant peoples will use to learn to ‘fish’ and successfully become self-sufficient.</p>

Security of food supply, the challenges of the agricultural sector and feed production, and the cost of living crisis must be addressed when the financing instruments and broad policy for cooperation and collaboration for development are being created. I welcome what is said on that subject in the report. I agree that the Commission should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the general budgetary support, containing details of the support being given to particular sectors, to particular projects, and to local governments.

The experience of the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been fundamental in understanding how the European Union should proceed in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework. If we want to make financing instruments effective, then we need to set up financing that is independent of other measures, recalculate quotas, and review how instruments are implemented. This review must be based on a Neighbourhood Policy that is sensitive to the range of needs of poorer countries and no longer just to the interests of Europe. I firmly believe that EU development policy must be the result of work by both Parliament and the Council, and that Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should also apply to this issue.

To begin with, I consider it essential that this new instrument continue to prioritise achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In order to achieve this aim – specifically, the eradication of poverty – it is essential that any future instrument be provided with realistic and adequate financial resources. The Commission should ensure that EU aid is consistent with development goals and targets set at international level. I would also reiterate the importance of how thoroughly eligibility criteria for countries benefiting from funding from this future instrument are applied. I would like to stress that the new DCI should provide a basis for targeted and more flexible aid in situations of fragility.

However, this instrument must be intelligently designed, and must be such that it improves the current situation without leading to further waste of resources. If this project is to be truly effective, action must be taken on two fronts. Firstly, given that the primary objective is the elimination of poverty, genuinely new funds must be allocated to the cause: funds must not be taken away from projects that are already ongoing. Secondly, I believe that the European Union needs to commit itself more wholeheartedly to this project.

In my opinion, the way the report analyses this issue is quite interesting: it proposes new approaches that will now have to be debated over the coming months, specifically as regards the need for aid to developing countries that is more differentiated, dividing them into groups. It also demonstrates the need for reliable and consistent retrospective analysis work in this area, proposing a new approach to development aid based on greater differentiation, on the involvement of civil society, and on strict eligibility criteria.</p>

Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 has been in force for four years and it is time to analyse it and learn from any potential errors and/or shortcomings that may exist, since the Commission is aiming to submit proposals before the summer relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period. I support the rapporteur’s proposals – not least, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the eradication of poverty, the channelling of 20% of resources into health and primary education, particular attention to climate issues, a new approach to aid in developing countries that demands respect for human rights, and the more efficient and effective use of scarce resources – so I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The policy of development aid is neither an altruistic obligation, nor a means for former colonial powers of easing their consciences, where there has been colonisation. It is, in its own right, one of the branches of foreign policy; however, it should also be an important part in a strategy for reversing migratory flows that enables populations to remain in or return to their country of origin and live life there with dignity and increasing prosperity.

The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament’s position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation, based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI. I agreed that a differentiated approach to the diverse group of developing countries is needed, and that traditional financial aid may become less relevant for emerging countries. I believe that aid for emerging countries, while promoting sustainable economic growth, should still focus on reinforcing the partner country’s fiscal policy and promoting mobilisation of domestic revenue which should lead to the reduction of poverty and aid dependence. We must refrain from using budget support in countries where transparency in public spending cannot be assured. Budget support must always be accompanied by actions to develop the receiving country’s parliamentary control and audit capacities and to increase transparency and public access to information, and civil society should be involved in monitoring budget support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I believe that the Mitchell report, which is an extremely good report, touches on many key issues, and I therefore decided to vote in favour of it. I believe that what matters most when considering the future shape of financing instruments for development is to remember that the overriding aim of development policy should be to reduce dependence on aid gradually, and for the country in question ultimately to achieve total independence. In connection with this, financing instruments should be designed in such a way as to ensure long-term economic growth in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Achievement of this goal is closely linked to how predictable development aid is, since it is only on the basis of such aid, at the same time as mobilising domestic revenues, that partner countries can construct an adequate and effective development strategy. In my opinion, a further crucial issue is that of increasing the European Parliament’s control and influence over the European Development Fund. I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund is detrimental to the transparency of development policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of adopting this report. Funding for development cooperation requires well-thought-out regulations, and the report provides a synthesis of what our priorities should be when adopting them. The goals pursued by the European Union when establishing this instrument are to ensure special EU assistance for developing countries. In view of our current struggle to cope with the financial crisis, the problems of poorer countries are becoming ever more evident. The financing instrument for development cooperation is aimed at helping poorer partner countries in the field of trade and regional integration, the natural environment and the management of natural resources, infrastructure, water and energy, rural development, agriculture and food security, human development and social cohesion. Furthermore, we want to support the development of government systems, democracy, human rights and also economic and institutional reforms, and to prevent conflicts and weakening of the state.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All the abovementioned goals are of the utmost importance in terms of strengthening security in poorer regions. Helping other countries to construct stable democratic societies in countries governed by the rule of law, where human rights are observed and freedom of speech is guaranteed, with a solid judicial system, territorial defence and armed forces, is a commendable plan. I hope that we will succeed in putting it into effect on a wider scale, making even more efficient use of funds.</p>

      <p sl="en">The future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms. The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0.7% of its GNI on ODA by 2015. To reach this aim, the current level of European aid will have to significantly increase. Given the added value of Commission aid, and the Commission’s new role in coordinating the Union’s and the Member States’ development policy (Article 210 TFEU), the share of ODA channelled through the EU budget should remain at least stable. The annual figures for the new development cooperation instrument in the next MFF period should significantly increase in real terms.</p>

It is important that Parliament have something to say as regards its scrutiny of this and future financial instruments. Despite the economic crisis we are experiencing, it is important to maintain these instruments for aiding developing countries so that they may be able, in the near future, to increase their levels of wealth, with the inherent improvement in the living conditions of the populations in these so-called emerging countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The upcoming instrument for funding development cooperation will have to have sufficient amounts at its disposal at the end of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Donor countries should respect their commitment to set aside 0.7% of their GDP to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015. As I have already said, nothing justifies a reduction in aid. Official Development Assistance currently represents more than USD 120 billion. We can do more and better. However, doing more and doing better is not just a case of increasing resources. The inclusion of the European Development Fund (EDF) in the budget would be significant progress as long as it does not lead to a reduction in total funding amounts at EU level. I am also in favour of ‘more’ budgetary aid, whether general or sector-specific, and fewer projects whenever the macro-economic and governance criteria allow. Firstly, it would make it possible to mobilise financial resources quickly in order to rebuild or consolidate the State. Secondly, it is the only kind of aid for which we can be sure that it will be absorbed in an optimal way. Finally, I believe that we need to ensure that this aid is more effective.</p>

I agree with the rapporteur that impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future. IAs show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them make a decision. IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making. However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator’s democratic and legitimate decision-making process. It should be pointed out that IAs merely contribute to the preparation of the specific content of a political decision. It is important for IAs to be completely independent and transparent and, moreover, the consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account. Parliament already has the power to issue its own IAs and submit Commission IAs to thorough scrutiny. Hitherto, however, this procedure has rarely been applied. I agree with the position set out in the resolution that the European Parliament should make greater use of the powers it has been given in this field.</p>

Impact studies should be applied to all legislative proposals, they should have a clear methodology, and they should be undertaken with full independence and transparency. IAs should also assess the option of inaction, as well as the specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessments. In the first place, the motion underlines the need, when carrying out impact assessments, to bear in mind the impact of new regulation on small and medium-sized enterprises and to reduce the regulatory burden on them. This emphasis on the needs of SMEs was key to my decision to vote in favour. In the second place, the motion highlights another very important factor, which is the specific nature of national economies. In order to safeguard their interests, the Commission should consult with individual Member States and the officials and representatives of the various national assessment bodies, in order to ensure that specific individual needs are not subordinate to Community interests. Finally, the motion calls for greater transparency and efficiency in the European Union’s administration processes, urging the Commission to be accountable to Parliament for its work.

For some time, the Commission has already been carrying out impact assessments of legislation before submitting legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council, but the report states that these impact assessment procedures still need to be greatly improved. For example, we should strengthen the independence of the Impact Assessment Board, which is currently under the authority of the President of the Commission. The report also calls on the European Parliament itself and its committees to carry out impact assessments of draft legislation more often and to scrutinise more closely the impact assessments carried out by the Commission, which frequently serve to justify a legislative proposal rather than to permit an objective consideration of the facts. Such preliminary impact assessments of proposed EU legislation were further enhanced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which added provisions on the mandatory assessment of the social and environmental impact of any proposed legislation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">One of the priority goals of European Union policy should be to introduce a transparent, clear, effective and high-quality regulatory environment. We have criticised the failings in transposition and implementation of the EU legislation in force numerous times, which result, to a large extent, from the fact that legislative texts have not been drafted properly. It is therefore the responsibility of Europe’s legislative bodies to face up to this problem. Impact assessments (IAs) present a systematic assessment of the probable effects of legislation in health, fundamental rights, social, economic, environmental, etc. terms, thereby contributing to cutting red tape and ensuring the consistency of EU policy. I am voting for this initiative, which acknowledges that IAs have a key role in aiding the decision-making process. They must be characterised by total independence and transparency, must follow a clear methodology, and must proceed to a substantiated and objective analysis of the potential effects, which is always accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis. This will contribute to reaching well thought-out and fully informed decisions, which should lead to better-quality legislation, to more correct transposition, application and oversight, and to a faster legislative process.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Impact assessments are tools that are especially useful for improving the quality of legislative activities (political proposals, for example). However, these impact assessments need to be adapted: new adaptations are indeed necessary, in particular, through creating an independent mechanism, for the impact assessments proposed by the European Commission are often inconsistent from a qualitative point of view and generally only serve to justify a legislative proposal rather than allow for an objective examination of the facts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am delighted that the report voted today stipulates that impact assessments be carried out totally independently; that impact assessments take a larger range of criteria into account (socio-economic, environmental, etc.); and also that the highest transparency be guaranteed, especially where experts are involved.

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report because I share the rapporteur’s view that IAs are crucial in order for us to carry out our work as law makers. The more we know about a given sector, the better our decision making with regard to it will be.

      <p sl="pt">Impact assessments (IAs) can constitute important support for the legislative process. To be so, they must study the economic, social, environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices, along with their impact on the public’s fundamental rights, throughout the political cycle. The assessment should not just be undertaken ex ante , but also ex post .</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the current IA process has numerous failings, as the report acknowledges. They often simply seek to convey supposed technical legitimacy and justification on measures that are the result of political choices and evaluations, which are conveniently hidden. There remain numerous questions regarding the methodology to be used in each case. On what or whom will the impact be measured? What is the scope of the assessment? What alternatives are to be analysed?</p>
      <p sl="pt">These decisions, too, normally depend on political choices and evaluations. That is why it is very important to ensure that impact studies are independent. In practice, however, this is difficult, given the multiple variables and interests involved. Transparency, openness, consultation, and public participation and scrutiny in connection with the studies and their results are of decisive importance in guaranteeing, as much as possible, this independence and the quality of the study.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Impact assessments (IAs) can be of significant help from the standpoint of better law making if the economic, social, environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices are studied throughout the political cycle, along with their impact on the public’s fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, in the issues that emerge in impact studies, we have the criteria used in those IAs. We know that there are a number of criteria and not just cost-benefit, and even there we need to know who is being hit by costs and who is enjoying benefits.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Niebler report represents an important contribution to the debate on improving the EU legislative procedure, with a view to ensuring that new legislation serves citizens and is genuinely necessary. Unfortunately, there have been accusations that regulations are also being created which result merely from the desire to make the EU institutions better known, or from the actions of lobbyists. This means that we need to make constant improvements to procedures relating to what is known as the impact assessment for a particular legislative act. As rapporteur in previous years for the subject of better law making, I would like to highlight several aspects of this problem. Firstly, we should note the need to maintain the institutional balance enshrined in the Treaty, within which framework the European Commission proposes laws and Parliament and the Council adopt them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The independence of impact assessments is extremely important, but they must not be removed from Parliament’s democratic control. In my opinion, the proposal to modify impact assessments after the introduction of amendments by Parliament is very important, and I also share the opinion of those who believe that we need to apply uniform criteria for impact assessments in all the institutions. At the same time, I would draw attention to the fact that the most crucial aspect of law making is the political will to resolve a given problem, and an impact assessment prepared as part of a particular project can merely supply objective information.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I have already had the opportunity to say in this House that it is time indeed that impact assessments be not only systematic, but, above all, credible. That we should objectively assess the consequences of a piece of legislation before taking it any further, rather than seeking by all means to justify it. And that it is not up to the Commission services, judges, parties and torturers all together to preside over this assessment. I do not know whether the solutions put forward by the rapporteur are the right ones. On the other hand, I do know that I agree with her diagnosis and that some of her observations are particularly relevant. Member States must therefore be closely involved in these studies because they are in a better position to assess the national impact of initiatives coming from Brussels. These studies must guide the choices and reflection of national parliaments, who, from now on, are the guardians of the respect for the principle of subsidiarity. These studies should lead to the abstention of the Commission, if its action turns out to be pointless, redundant or costly. Finally, we should be able to quickly draw the consequences of a piece of legislation, the implementation of which creates more problems than it solves. For all these reasons, even though I am under no illusions about its realisation, I voted for Mrs Niebler’s report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The process of assessing the impacts of a regulation contributes significantly towards reducing the bureaucratic burden that is a by-product of statutory regulation. A special Impact Assessment Board was set up at Commission level some time ago, and it assesses impacts both ex ante and ex post . The Commission also carries out public consultations on its legislative plans. The European Parliament has so far lacked an impact assessment body. I therefore applaud the fact that the report calls for the creation of infrastructure making it possible to evaluate the impacts of proposals and plans formulated in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently. I would also like to call for a simplification of the process of public consultations, and an extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals, including the possibility of submitting proposals in all official languages of the Union.</p>

The third section is devoted to the impact assessments carried out by the European Parliament, which its committees are invited to use more extensively in order to further improve law making. The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous impact assessment structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament’s committees should use to create more synergies. With regard to the above, and in view of the fact that impact assessments can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator’s democratically legitimated decision-making process, but merely permit the technical, substantive preparation of a political decision, I voted in favour of the motion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future. The benefits of IAs are obvious. They show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them in making a decision. IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making. However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator’s democratically legitimated decision-making process. They merely permit the technical, substantive preparation of a political decision. The IAs used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles. First of all, they should be completely independent and transparent, cover all categories of legislative proposal and employ a clear methodology. The policy options listed should also include the option of taking no action. The specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account where appropriate and they must always be kept up to date with current developments in the legislative process. Parliament’s key demand is the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament, with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating synergies with the possibility of a common mechanism for all EU institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome this report as I believe impact assessments to be a key instrument in the legislative process. European legislators should make greater use of these instruments as they can improve the legislative process by showing the possible impacts of their policy decisions. Legislators must not be afraid to state harsh realities when looking at potential impacts. Not only should impact assessments state the possibilities and make recommendations to legislators, they must also be prepared to recommend taking no action at all if it is considered to be the most appropriate course. Legislation coming from Europe has a massive impact on the lives of those living within its borders and we must use every opportunity to ensure this legislation is as fair and balanced as possible.</p>

IAs play a key role in a policy’s entire development cycle, and are also necessary for high-quality legislation, and for its proper transposition and application.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore support Parliament’s proposed criteria for consideration when IAs are undertaken.

      <p sl="pt">However, they must not just be promoted prior to a piece of legislation (ex ante), but also following its adoption (ex post).

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this resolution on the Green Paper from the Commission on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and business. Contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market; its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious. Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular SMEs, and consumers. The potential benefits of European contract law to the Internal Market have been discussed for a good many years. The EP pronounced itself for the first time on the issue in 1989 and, with this resolution which the EP adopted today, it intends to respond to the recent Commission Green Paper on European contract law, and to set out the Parliament’s priorities in this area. I support the view of the rapporteur that the option of setting up an optional instrument (OI) for European contract law by virtue of a regulation is to be favoured. It could be complemented by a ‘toolbox’ for Commission and legislator which should be implemented by an interinstitutional agreement.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The most obvious obstacles which consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises face with regard to the Single Market are complex contractual relations, unfair terms and conditions in contracts, inadequate and insufficient information, time-consuming procedures, language barriers, different taxation systems, reliability of online traders, demographic composition of the population of individual Member States, concerns regarding confidentiality, complaint handling and intellectual property rights. European contract law stipulates and regulates Internal Market transactions, and aims to resolve problems relating to the Single Market which have arisen for various reasons, including even differences in contract law legislation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. In the wake of the global financial crisis, it is very important to realise the full potential of the Internal Market, and thus help meet the strategic goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. Today, owing to many factors, including a failure to implement existing single market legislation, the Single Market remains fragmented. Consumers have no confidence in cross-border commerce and companies face huge administrative and legal difficulties if they want to expand their activities in other EU Member States. Divergence of contract law at national level leads to additional transaction costs, legal uncertainty for companies and a lack of consumer confidence in the Internal Market. It is partly for these reasons that consumers and enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited resources, avoid cross-border transactions, which prevents the creation of a competitive Internal Market. I agree with the report’s call to take action and propose methods of harmonising contract law practice at EU level, which would ensure equal and fair conditions for market participants.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Contracts are the fundamental links in relationships between companies and consumers. The European Union’s Single Market is founded on a variety of contracts regulated by various national-level bodies of law. These differences in contract law discourage companies, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, from dedicating themselves to cross-border trade, thus preventing them from accessing the new opportunities and income offered by the Internal Market. Furthermore, consumers are disadvantaged by limited choice, high prices and lower quality because of weak cross-border competition. It should be noted, for example, that only 8% of consumers buy online from other Member States. This report, which I voted for, advocates the need for an Optional Instrument (OI) for European-level contract law in the form of a regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This will enable consumers to enjoy better protection under the umbrella of European contract law, and better security when they make cross-border transfers. For their part, companies – SMEs in particular – will find it easier and less costly to conclude contracts under the umbrella of a common body of EU contract law.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I voted against Mrs Wallis’s report because the optional instrument envisaged, based on a regulation, basically marks the first step towards harmonising contract law in Member States. I think that such harmonisation, even to a minimal extent, is inconceivable at the present stage in view of the different way contractual relations are regulated in Member States. For example, there is the right in rem effect, which does not feature in German law. Apart from this, harmonisation of contract law would not prevent the discrepancies in other areas influencing transnational trade within the EU. There is no categorical proof indicating that it is these legal differences which are preventing transactions from being completed with foreign companies and consumers. Contracts with an international element are currently drawn up based on international private law and, at EU level, on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008. An additional instrument would introduce unnecessary confusion. With regard to contractual relations without any international element, I think that every Member State must continue to apply its own national legislation, according to its legal tradition and established practices.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted against a report that proposes an optional legal instrument for contract law, effectively laying the foundations for a future body of European civil law, to take precedence over domestic civil laws. This would mean the end of national legal traditions and the laws that every Member State has laid down on issues as sensitive as civil and contract law. In any case, although the objective of introducing an optional instrument is to facilitate cross-border trade, taking the needs of consumers and companies into due account, it must be borne in mind that existing European legislation already satisfies the needs of the various actors involved. The real objective of the report therefore appears to be more ambitious than the creation of a European civil code, with which I cannot agree.</p>

      <p sl="it">I offer my congratulations on the work carried out by the rapporteur, for which I voted. This report responds to the needs of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises, which, unlike other actors representing bigger economic entities, have obvious difficulties accessing the Internal Market because of the enormous costs they have to bear. As a direct result, both SMEs and consumers tend to carry out transactions within the domestic market, which is often much less competitive, and therefore do not access the cross-border market, in which products are often at least 10% cheaper than the domestic offer. The divergence in contract law rights must be remedied, and the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law by means of a regulation, which would flank rather than replace Member States’ national contract law systems, is an optimal solution that would give the parties the freedom to choose the legal instrument most suited to their needs.</p>

By introducing EU contract law and making it optional for businesses to choose domestic or European legislation, it confuses the system and will create legislative overlaps that may result in expensive tribunals. It is also likely that EU contract law will favour EU social and employment policy, such as the Working Time Directive, which has both proven highly unpopular and caused disruption in the UK for a range of essential industries and services. It is also highly likely that legislation that, for the time being, carries a discretional opt-in will later be made obligatory by the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report seeks to dress itself up in rhetoric surrounding the defence of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Its context, however, includes dangers for both: consumers &amp; SMEs. The rapporteur’s vision is markedly neoliberal, as is clear from the stress given to breaking down ‘barriers faced by those who wish to enter into cross-border transactions in the Internal Market and considers that, along with other measures, the European contract law project could be useful for realising the full potential of the Internal Market’. The liberalisations and deepening of the Internal Market that the EU has been carrying out demonstrate that it is big business that benefits above all. The present dynamics suggest that proposals for the harmonisation of contracts – still optional at this stage – will be implemented with these same interests at the forefront.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These reservations are borne out by statements in the report, such as that the optional instrument ‘must offer a very high level of consumer protection, in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law’.

However, all this is an attempt to dress up the product in order to hide its real dangers from the electorate. Therefore, we are not voting in favour of the report.</p>

Bearing in mind the fact that every initiative in the area of contract law will have to respond clearly to the actual needs and problems of businesses and consumers, I take the view that any justification in this area will have to be based on practical evidence relating to the current situation in contract law and any difficulties encountered by businesses and consumers, particularly in cross-border transactions. The broad and balanced involvement of the participants is of fundamental importance. It will be particularly decisive during the legislative process, and all available resources will be required in order to ensure inclusivity and transparency.

This new European law is supposed to remove barriers to cross-border trade, arising from the differences between national legal systems. The problem is that nothing in Mrs Wallis’ report proves the objective existence of such barriers, and therefore of a problem that needs to be solved. Consequently, nothing, except the will to initiate a new method of imposing supranational legislation, justifies such a position.

      <p sl="lt">I abstained from voting on this report because, according to the rapporteur, complexity in contractual relations is one of the most evident impediments that consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face in the Single Market. Hence, the proposal to establish a common European contract law, which would benefit consumers and help ensure increased cross-border trade within the Internal Market. According to the rapporteur, all parties, be it in business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, should be free to choose or not to choose the optional instrument (OI) as an alternative to national or international law (opt-in). Further attention is required to ensure that the OI offers protection to consumers and small businesses given their position as the weaker commercial partner and that any confusion is avoided when making a choice of law. I abstained from voting because the EU recently adopted the Rome I Regulation, which regulates this area and defends consumer rights well, whereas this proposal is purely based on the UK situation and would only cause turbulence and increased bureaucracy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I do not support the proposal to create an entirely new legal instrument in the form of a European contract law. The creation of this instrument is the first step towards the creation of a pan-European civil code, which would gradually replace the contract law of the individual Member States. The proposed concept may talk about the voluntary application of this instrument, but nevertheless it is clear from many indications that volunteering is only a kind of precursor to a subsequent mandatory application in cross-border contractual relationships. If this instrument is created, we will be introducing a completely new type of supranational law, which will be on the boundary between EU law and international private and commercial law, not to mention the fact that the mandate for creating a European contract law for consumers and businesses does not have sufficient support in primary EU law. We should therefore stick to a standard instrument, for which there is sufficient legal support in primary law in the form of harmonisation.</p>

To enjoy the fruits of an effective integrated market, it is also necessary to tackle the indirect causes that stifle the cross-border aspirations of our fellow citizens. On top of a number of administrative difficulties, European entrepreneurs are too often faced with very diverse contractual regulations in force in the Member States. These obstacles are particularly difficult to overcome for SMEs, which nevertheless are the most effective tool for boosting growth. As a result, the European Commission has published a Green Paper on the subject and launched a broad public consultation. I voted for Parliament’s present resolution for it takes a common sense approach by proposing an instrument that is concurrent with national legislation and would facilitate cross-border trade. This ‘European contract’ would be optional, would come with a ‘toolbox’ to clarify how it should be used and it would encourage greater protection of consumers.</p>

      <p sl="it">Divergences in European contract law end up discouraging businesses from engaging in cross-border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers. Consequently, consumers are also disadvantaged by limited product choice, higher prices and lower quality due to weak cross-border competition. In this regard, we wish to introduce some innovations, including business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts regulated by an optional instrument that would enlarge the parties’ choice, and the introduction of a monitoring and review mechanism in order to ensure that the optional instrument keeps up with market needs and legal and economic developments. Simplicity and readiness for use should be a key objective. Provisions on sale of goods merit priority, as do service contracts. Finally, the introduction of a trust mark system would ensure additional consumer protection. Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.</p>

However, consumer and business groups have come together on this issue to reject Mrs Wallis’ proposal of an optional instrument of contract law. They maintain that rules of national contract law are not a factor in influencing consumer attitudes to buying from another Member State; in fact, there are other genuine barriers to cross-border trade, such as administrative and cultural differences and a lack of effective means of redress for consumers. Mrs Wallis has failed to provide compelling evidence of the need for an optional instrument. Indeed, such a proposal could even undermine existing consumer rights.</p>

The related efforts to find a common legal framework here have been ongoing since 1989. In 2008, the EU Commission circulated a proposal for a directive on consumer rights. It is of far greater importance for Europe’s consumers that consumer protection should be improved at EU level.

The Rome I Regulation currently in force is an adequate regulatory instrument, which provides for a high level of protection of the weaker contractual party. The provisions of this regulation protect consumers when seeking redress from businesses in other Member States with whom they have entered into a contract. Given that a well-functioning legal regulation mechanism is already in force in this area in the European Union, I do not endorse this resolution on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses, which proposes adopting a new regulation, which would set up a new optional instrument, to be applied in business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions. Attention should be drawn to the fact that the new regulation would result in much confusion and a lack of clarity in this area.

      <p sl="en">The EU cannot claim to be a single market if obstacles to trade still exist. The immense costs incurred in cross-border trading represent a serious barrier. Between legal fees, translation fees and implementation fees, it can cost small businesses up to EUR 15 000 to enter the e-commerce market of just one Member State. According to a Flash Eurobarometer survey in 2008, this barrier is seen as a major concern by up to 60% of retailers. If laws regulating consumer transactions were harmonised throughout the EU, small and medium businesses (SMEs) and consumers in all Member States would benefit. The removal of these barriers would encourage more SMEs to exploit the potential of e-commerce. I believe SMEs are crucial for economic recovery in many Member States. Ireland’s path to recovery is being export-led; thus the removal of barriers entering in the EU market is crucial. The findings and recommendations of this report also show the potential for great benefits for consumers. If cross-border trade increases, consumers will be offered a wider choice of products and more competitive prices.</p>

      <p sl="pt">One of the most burning issues in EU law involves the harmonisation of contract law. On the one hand, it seems that the need for greater internal consistency is being felt, in order that companies can benefit from the common market’s potential without fearing that there might be solutions in a given foreign legal system that they had not anticipated and for which they had not prepared, which has been a real problem. On the other, however, there is a certain resistance amongst Member States to sacrificing their legal solutions, which is hardly surprising given that these have developed over centuries and that they are widely known by their respective populations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, in its Green Paper of 1 July 2010, the Commission tabled several solutions for regulatory models ranging from mere soft law to a European civil code.

It is necessary to emphasise that GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general. Furthermore, it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost. I therefore welcome the provision set out in the resolution that we need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress, and to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion. We also need to develop indicators that reflect the household level more accurately: income, consumption and wealth. It is therefore important to develop a tool to complement GDP.

Therefore, in a context in which the correlation between a range of non-market activities and GDP is no longer automatic, there is a need to develop additional clear and measurable medium- and long-term indicators that ensure comparability between countries and regions and that can be used for projecting future developments and designing policies.</p>

It was developed in the 1930s and has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general. A series of international initiatives highlighted broad support by policy makers and experts from the fields of economics, environmental protection and civil society for the development of indicators to complement GDP, providing more comprehensive information to support policy making. GDP does not, in fact, provide a reliable basis for policy debate. In particular, it does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration. In the political and scientific discussion that has been going on for years, I believe the problem is more about how this approach can be achieved using clearly defined and quantifiable indicators. At European and Member State level, there have been many initiatives to fill the gaps in these areas. Unfortunately, there are only partial signs of coherent action.

To enable us to cope with current and future problems, new indicators need to be devised which will complement and further refine GDP.

      <p sl="it">Indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon. Simple phenomena can be interpreted using simple indicators, while complex phenomena require complex indicators. Gross domestic product is a simple indicator, while development is a complex phenomenon. Indeed, the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP, which takes a snapshot of a given moment. Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected, such as investment in intangible infrastructure, including know-how (people, processes and products, to mention just a few examples), and investment in tangible infrastructure, including communication and transport networks (ICT networks and road and rail networks, for example). In addition, GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy. For these reasons, the European Commission’s efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended.

This is why I support the report by Mrs Rosbach, which draws up new indicators taking account of major strands of environmental policy such as energy use, biodiversity, water use and waste generation. The challenge lies in integrating existing indices with other elements that are politically relevant and empirically measurable, and which provide reliable statistics on the future development of countries. In this sense, I believe that by eliminating subjective factors such as personal happiness, which cannot be considered to be indicators, the new text has reached a good compromise.

Therefore, the development of a Member State or region cannot be assessed solely by an economic indicator such as GDP: quality of life, which is determined by factors such as health, education, culture, employment, housing and climate and environmental conditions, must also be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Gross domestic product is a widely used index for measuring social development and economic progress. However, its universality raises doubts as to whether it fails to take into account a series of indicators which are crucial for quality of life in a given country. There are also some significant parameters which are interpreted incorrectly. The Commission has suggested that it is essential to develop an indicator which clearly depicts the situation in the country in question, and which also reflects the situation of households and individuals, as well as how efficiently the country’s resources are exploited and the state of the environment. The Commission expects greater involvement from the Member States in terms of systematising research into the quality of public life, which would make it possible for clear comparisons to be made between countries. A coherent policy would result in it being easier to analyse research, and also in it being possible to predict the potential long-term development of countries.</p>

It does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress. Moreover, in certain cases, GDP may provide inaccurate and misleading information. Consequently, we must make every effort to develop additional medium and long-term indicators for measuring the factors mentioned and the household level.</p>

In a world in which people’s quality of life is increasingly measured using other, non-economic factors, various international institutions, like the United Nations (UN), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are currently studying the definition of new indicators, so as to measure and analyse economic and social progress.</p>

      <p sl="lt">If we cast a glance at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) GDP scale (the EU is in first place, Lithuania is 82nd), we can see that GDP does not tell the entire story. GDP does not sufficiently reflect the complex socio-economic reality of national and regional challenges. Although GDP is a strong macro-economic indicator, it does not reflect Lithuania’s greatest social problems, such as unemployment, the quality of education and health care systems and disparities in income distribution. In Lithuania, and at EU level, there is often a lack of clear information, data and indicators, and I therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal to provide a better report on social indicators. I hope that this will provide more comprehensive information for developing policies.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Nowadays, unfortunately, politicians often do not have such information. The development of EU policies should not be purely based on abstract statistics. Above all, EU policy should be measured by the progress made in improving the well-being of Europeans. The ‘Beyond GDP’ method mentioned in this report may prove very useful. However, before implementing it, we should find out more about the possibilities of adapting the new method in everyday life.</p>

      <p sl="en">Galileo, Europe’s own global navigation satellite system, is of great importance to Europe and, in particular, the UK. This project, which I fully support, has not only received significant public funding but private industry throughout the EU is also investing money, time and expertise into developing this system.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, despite recognising the need to push forward with this, I felt the need to abstain on the final vote. Mr Remek’s report suggests completing the Galileo system will require additional funding of up to EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). In this current difficult financial climate, I have to oppose this increase in spending, especially considering that the programme is already 60% over budget. I believe that Galileo must stay within its current budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us look at how we can improve the current system within the means that we have. I would strongly urge the Commission to take robust action to improve its programme management and to achieve savings.

The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite system for two key reasons: firstly, Europe’s independence from other global navigation systems and autonomy, and secondly, to gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market, which today, to a large extent, is dominated by the US. Indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year (including the downstream and upstream market and public benefits). GNSS is seen as a disruptive technology, with high potential to create innovations, build up a high-tech knowledge base and increase productivity in many sectors. Annual growth rates of the market for GNSS-enabled products and services are estimated to be above 10%. The Commission should launch a comprehensive analysis to identify more precisely the possible scenarios and means of operation and exploitation post 2013. This includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal, contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put in place.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ten years ago, the European Union launched two satellite navigation programmes: Galileo and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service). The first will be operational in 2014 and will be accurate to within less than a metre, whereas GPS is accurate to within several metres. This technological progress will enable European companies to innovate and position themselves at the cutting edge of services made possible by global positioning. However, there is also a strategic dimension to Galileo. At present, Europe is dependent on the GPS system, which is American. When Galileo is in place, the Union will enjoy total independence as well as superiority in this area, and it is plain to see the importance of the applications. The civilian and military resources of the Member States will be much more effective as a result. I voted for this resolution which, while praising the technical success, reminds the European Commission of the points where the programme can be improved: funding, public awareness, and involving our international partners.</p>

      <p sl="it">We believe that the EU’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), consisting of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes, is an important step for Europe, firstly, as it ensures its autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and, secondly, as it enables it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market. It is very important, however, that continuity of service is guaranteed, as a (temporary) limitation or degradation of GPS signals will have tremendous effects on our economy and society, without other independent GNSS systems in place. Nevertheless, to fully exploit its advantages, Galileo needs to reach full operating capacity, and to do so will require additional investment. Currently, the financial picture is anything but positive. On this point, we think that a broad and comprehensive political debate should take place about the desired level of ambition and the financial resources available.

It is not just follow-up costs that have exploded: ‘normal’ project costs have also reached massive proportions. An attempt is now being made to limit damage by making savings. These are necessary moves. Unfortunately, it seems as if these cuts will only affect the European taxpayer as they will result in reductions in services. Although GNSS will only have a military application, it will be the taxpayers who foot the bill – twice over now as a result of the follow-up costs.

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the report on the mid-term review of the Galileo programme. The ambitious European endeavour to develop a European satellite navigation system, based on a constellation of 30 satellites and offering quality global positioning services, guarantees Europe’s autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and a share in the important global high-tech market, on which the USA and Japan are currently top of the league. Moreover, Galileo will have the facility to support the implementation of previous traffic management systems for all means of transport (road, air, sea, etc.), which will improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact. In the agricultural sector, Galileo will be able to support improvements to agricultural output by guaranteeing more efficient use of land and water, thereby reducing the need for fertilisers and pesticides. However, the questions raised and my previous question to the Commission (E-0339/10) about the very high cost of this particular endeavour have remained unanswered. To be precise, the cost of implementing the programme was initially estimated at EUR 3 330 million (of which 1 800 million was to be paid by the public sector). This was increased to EUR 5 580 million, all of which is to be paid by the public sector at a very difficult time for the economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this important resolution on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe. I support the rapporteur that with the rejection of the option of freezing the resources, as proposed by five Heads of Government in December 2010 (France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Finland), the European Parliament is sending a strong political signal for the negotiations between the 27 Member States, due to start after the official presentation of the European Commission proposal expected on 29 June. It is important to note that unanimity between the Member States and the assent of the European Parliament are needed to take the final decision, not expected until at least June 2012. We, Members of the European Parliament, demand at least an increase of the level of resources of 5% compared to the 2013 budget. It is also important to note that the European Parliament proposes to introduce a new structure for the financial framework under a single ‘Europe 2020’ heading and asks for a 5, or 5+5 year-long framework as of 2021.</p>

      <p sl="it">After around a year’s work, the special committee on policy challenges and budgetary resources has finally presented the future decisions determining priorities in expenditure for the efficient and effective use of European Union appropriations leading to the implementation of result-oriented policies. Bearing in mind that the European Union budget is primarily an investment budget, which can generate more investment from public or private sources, it must be possible to adjust it adequately to changing needs and circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="it">The decision to increase the resources of the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 5% will guarantee the stability of existing programming cycles and new investment in areas such as European energy and transport networks, which will allow Europe to defend its competitiveness and prepare the ground for long-term economic growth. These sectors also appear in the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth through knowledge, innovation and the promotion of social and territorial cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report on a New Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe is a valuable piece of collective analysis on the future configurations of the EU budget. It estimates the financial resources needed for the Union to attain its objectives and carry out its policies for the period starting 1 January 2014. Its essential point is a request for an increase of at least 5% in the total EU budget for 2013, and the request for the introduction of an autonomous source of funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report stresses very clearly that without sufficient additional resources in the post-2013 MFF, the Union will not be able to fulfil the existing policy priorities, linked, in particular, to the Europe 2020 strategy, or the new tasks provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, let alone respond to unforeseen events. I voted in favour of this report also because it calls for a more transparent, simpler and fairer financing system for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this excellent report by my colleague, Mr Garriga Polledo, as it provides an extremely good presentation of the budget that the European Union will need after 2013 to respond to the political challenges it will face. If Europe really intends to implement the policies laid down in the European Treaties, including the most recent policies, it must have the financial resources it needs to fulfil these ambitions. Therefore, I voted for the collection of ‘own resources’ and the creation of a ‘tax on financial transactions’ to fund the European Union’s budget. This necessary increase in the European budget must be accompanied by substantial savings through optimising (pooled) expenditure. Furthermore, the common agricultural policy (CAP), which is essential for the food security and independence of our continent, and EU regional policy, strengthened by creating an intermediate category of regions to enable additional financial support to be channelled to those regions where per capita GDP is between 75% and 90% of the European average, such as Auvergne and Limousin, find within it all the space that they deserve. This report is therefore of inestimable support to citizens!</p>

      <p sl="ga">The European farming sector is of socio-economic importance, particularly in terms of ensuring the security of food supply and in terms of promoting rural communities and the environment. So, the CAP must have a strong budget and proper resources so as to be able to meet those goals. I fully support what is in the report on the broad aims and tasks of the CAP and that there be no cuts in CAP funding for 2013, so that it would be able to properly meet those broad needs.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Much is expected of the next Multiannual Financial Framework in terms of achieving the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy, encouraging research and innovation, combating the challenges facing the environment, achieving the aims of the European Social, Cohesion and Regional Funds, and fostering education, mobility, training and lifelong learning. The EU must have adequate resources and a strong Multiannual Financial Framework if it is to achieve those goals and meet the needs of the people of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. The European Union faces enormous challenges, and will require significant financial resources to overcome these. It is clear that the EU budget’s current resource system will be incapable of ensuring the implementation of all the commitments made. I agree that it is necessary to fundamentally review budgeting principles, so that, in future, funds for the EU budget are collected from own resources. We also urgently need to consider innovative financing mechanisms, such as a tax on financial transactions, which would make a significant contribution to financing the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I cannot support the report by Mr Garriga Polledo. The reason for this is that I am fundamentally against Member States’ contributions being replaced with direct EU funding, for which read an EU tax. After all, the Union should be at the service of Member States and that must be visible in the financing arrangements. In terms of content, I have problems with the EU 2020 strategy being used as a guideline for the Multiannual Financial Framework. The objectives of the strategy concern social and employment policies, which fall within the competence of individual Member States. The failed Lisbon strategy shows where we will end up if we base our strategy on matters over which the EU has no say. The report also seeks to reduce the amount of arrears by increasing payments. If projects are not being implemented smoothly, then the sensible thing to do would be to enter into fewer new contractual commitments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In brief, the report shows no trace of understanding of prudent budgetary management, in light of the enormous economic problems facing European economies. ‘Cut your coat according to your cloth’ is a better suggestion than this undesirable call for more and new resources. In this way, we are repeating, at a European level, the mistakes which several countries have made in recent years.</p>

This is why I support the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework, which will help convince European citizens that the Union has the ability to think and act to protect their long-term interests and achieve effective results in ensuring stable growth and internal cohesion. Although there are a few decisions which I do not fully agree with, the report is, on the whole, beneficial to Bulgaria’s interests, and I voted to adopt it.</p>

It discusses funding for Roma communities, a subject that my political party has always opposed, and the allocation of large amounts of funding for a new round of enlargement of the European Union in the direction of the Western Balkans, another point with which I do not agree. Finally, European funding has been pledged to help developing countries combat climate change, an issue which, aside from environmental propaganda, will certainly not change the future of the ecosystem.</p>

Following the debate, the resolution adopted criticised the idea put forward by certain Member States of freezing the EU budget at 2013 levels, given the financial difficulties that many EU countries have faced in recent times. Instead, when determining the EU financial perspective 2014-2020, we were urged to continue to guarantee the required financing for areas that stimulate economic growth and successful development. These areas include research and fostering innovation, combating unemployment, poverty and exclusion, adequate preparedness for demographic changes, responsible use of natural resources, internal and external security, regional and agricultural policy, and development of energy and transport infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="it">I congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which I endorsed. Europe must use the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to provide definite answers to the citizens, who have been suffering from the economic crisis for too long now, and to ensure robust long-term growth. So far, the European Union has fallen short of the expectations and ambitions it should have. We will have to face very complex challenges as well as the economic crisis, demographic decline and energy shortages. The response to these challenges will have to be sought in the Europe 2020 strategy, which should be the policy reference of the next MFF. We must identify a number of key priorities for the next MFF, such as growth and employment, sustainable development, cohesion for growth and employment, citizenship and Global Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">The next MFF must therefore be designed in such a way as to ensure flexibility in order to avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF. In fact, it would be a good idea to plan a mid-term review to allow for the possibility of revising the ceilings. Finally, it is crucial to enhance the current system of extra-budgetary instruments for flexibility, simplifying their use and providing them with sufficient envelopes. The next MFF should strike the right balance between stability, medium-term predictability and flexibility, a principle which should remain at its core.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted on Wednesday, 8 June for an increase in the 2014-2020 budget. As we know, the budget represents the start of any political act. If you have no budget, you have no project. The EU budget must therefore reflect the EU’s growth strategy and its ambitions for its citizens. The Member States have suggested freezing the EU budget for two reasons. On the one hand, the money comes from contributions by the States and, on the other, a stable budget for the 2014-2020 period means that all the EU’s major projects to restore growth and to invest in the future are jeopardised. Member States would like to see the EU playing a decisive role when it comes to taking risks but they criticise it when it does so. I therefore, like the majority of my fellow Members – with the exception of the Eurosceptics – voted for a 5% increase in the budget to fund future major projects. We are now well aware of the fact that States are incapable of resolving on their own the problems caused by globalisation. The next step will be to provide the EU with a budget based on ‘own resources’ in order to curtail our reliance on the ‘bad’ will of States.</p>

Our ambition is to have a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe. If we want to achieve this ambitious goal, I believe that the financial resources the EU has need to be just as ambitious.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I believe that a minimum 5% increase is needed to the budget envisaged for the next MFF. The EU also needs to hold an in-depth discussion on the topic of own resources involving both representatives of the European institutions and national parliaments, so as to reach a consensus on an own resources system which will ensure the effective implementation of European policies. I support the idea expressed in this report about the need to channel the resources towards those measures aimed at achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also fully concur with the need to ensure coherence and complementarity between the various instruments which currently exist for supporting research, development and innovation.

While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions, which they would like to see fall, and of its financial returns, which they would like to see increase, this report argues for strong, integrated community policies, both in terms of long-standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="en">We need to gear the EU budget for the 21st century. The budget must match our ambitions. New pan-European investments are needed to boost European-level added value by acting as a catalyst for further private investment and by creating economies of scale. Major green investment is needed in areas like renewable infrastructure, with more wind farms in the north and solar energy in the south. Irish investment in wind energy will only pay off, for example, if there is European infrastructure to export that energy via the UK and France. With oil prices rising and increasing environmental damage, we know the EU must now drive forward to a more sustainable society by becoming more energy efficient, by using more renewable energy, by investing in public transport and ensuring our children live in a clean and healthy environment. The long term EU budget should also follow the agreed so-called EU 2020 strategic objectives, especially our internationally binding climate objectives. CAP should be reformed to pay farmers for the delivery of public goods, such as an attractive countryside rich in biodiversity. We need to maintain the CAP budget to ensure these vital environmental services are provided in Ireland and across Europe.</p>

In order to meet citizens’ needs, Parliament has proposed to create, in the context of the Structural Funds, a new category of regions where GDP per capita is between 75% and 90% of the Union’s GDP.

The Europe 2020 strategy and investment in initiatives with European added value permeated the debates during the work on the report. However, I am deeply concerned about the fact that we have given the authority to set priorities to the Council. The European Parliament should have had the courage to set priorities.

      <p sl="pt">At a time when the EU has already understood that greater coordination of economic policy and greater control of budgetary policy are both necessary, the idea that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should support economic governance seems an extremely relevant one to me.</p>

I consider placing the MFF at the service of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and the concern for at least maintaining the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget and keeping the two-pillar system, to be positive.

      <p sl="pt">The Europe 2020 strategy is consensual, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable. It will be the guide for the forthcoming financial perspectives. However, the strategy will only be successful if it has budgets corresponding to its actions and objectives. In this sense, it is necessary for the MFF’s values to match the ambition and commitment that the Europe 2020 strategy constitutes. Cohesion policy is a result of the solidarity principle. It is important that this cohesion be economic, social and territorial, and that it support the poorest regions. I consider it essential that funding for cohesion policy be at least maintained at the same levels.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The common agricultural policy (CAP) has been a success. Therefore, the total sums channelled into agriculture should also be kept up and should be distributed more equitably.

There is, therefore, a pressing need to go ahead with the debate on the new own resources.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur has stated that the time has come to put a stop to loudly proclaimed statements of intent that are not properly backed up with the financial resources enabling the announced objectives to be actually achieved. This report is a perfect example of this exercise. By basically proposing that the EU budget be frozen until the 2020 review, with a residual increase of 5%, many of the objectives that feature in the course of its 40 pages are being compromised, particularly, that of social and economic cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the face of a serious economic and social crisis, exacerbated by EU policy, the budgets made possible by these financial perspectives will thus be rendered incapable of ensuring a redistributive function, which is essential to the effective realisation of the principle of cohesion. We have made countless proposals on the need to increase the EU budget to support economic and social cohesion, as well as to reduce the compulsory nature of national contributions, cutting them to a maximum of 10% of the total cost for the project submitted, particularly in the countries with the greatest financial difficulties. Furthermore, we have been stressing the importance of promoting investment in public services, of supporting production, of creating jobs with rights, of eradicating poverty, and of combating social inequality.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is especially serious that it does not tackle, as an absolute priority, the response to the serious social problems created by the economic and social crisis, with a significant increase in the EU budget for supporting economic and social cohesion, accompanied by a cut in compulsory national contributions, reducing them to a maximum of 10% of the project submitted. Above all, in the countries with the greatest financial difficulties, it should commit to investment in public services, to supporting production, to creating jobs with rights, to eradicating poverty, and to combating social inequality and all types of discrimination, not least gender.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is also necessary to promote peace, development cooperation and aid, and a significant cut in military spending and overseas representation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Lamentably, the report limits itself to proposing a residual increase in current EU budget values of 5%, despite opposing the freezing of the post-2013 EU budget, as advocated by some Member States. However, this suggested increase means that the next Multiannual Financial Framework (financial perspectives) 2014-2020 would represent just 1.11% of EU gross national income (GNI), as opposed to 1.06%, the sum projected for 2013.</p>

It must ensure the highest possible level of European added value, it must be sensibly managed and it must support public and private resources as far as possible. The structure of the future Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should be realistic, and it should enable continuity of planning and avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF, especially the lack of flexibility within the areas. With regard to the method for developing a system of own resources for the EU, which is gradually being replaced by Member State contributions and is consequently perceived as an excessive burden on the public finances of Member States, the reform of this system is more necessary than at any time in the past.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, a better system ensuring fairness, transparency and sufficient budgetary revenues would make it possible for the budgetary decision-making process to focus more on the key priorities of the Union. In particular, the current exemptions and corrective mechanisms should be gradually phased out, which would be an essential step towards greater fairness and transparency in the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU budget post-2013 must be fit for purpose to maintain competitiveness, to increase economic growth and to combat high unemployment in Europe. I believe that agriculture and a strong, well resourced common agricultural policy are central to this objective. I fully support the call in the report to link agriculture to the Europe 2020 strategy as I firmly believe that the agriculture and food sector can make a valuable contribution to future economic growth in Ireland and across Europe. That is why it is essential that we protect and maintain the some EUR 1.7 billion which Ireland annually receives under the CAP. A strongly funded common agricultural policy will protect Europe’s food security, contribute to our climate change targets and maintain employment in our rural communities. I am pleased that the report recognises the role played by the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in maintaining employment in coastal, island and remote regions. I believe that we must direct more funding to these communities under the European Fisheries Fund post-2013. The peace process in Ireland has benefited hugely from the EU budget. I urge all Members to support the retention of these important programmes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">To be brief, notwithstanding the exceptional length of the text, Parliament calls for the European budget, in its total amount and distribution, to be adapted after 2013 to the competences and very large number of priorities of the European Union, as it defines them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It therefore demands for it to be increased – by at least 5% in the first instance. How is it to be financed? By a new European tax, of course! Who are they trying to kid? Europe already costs a great deal. What has been the result? Powerlessness in the face of the crisis, harm caused by the euro, the trade agreements and the Schengen Agreement, useless posturing, interferences and obstacles in other domains.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when Member States are being asked to slash their own budgets drastically, when people are being summoned to tighten their belts, when social security systems are being undermined by unemployment and immigration, while those responsible for the crisis continue to line their pockets and markets continue to speculate, it is obscene for this assembly, in cahoots with Brussels, to demand a single cent more to pursue these policies and make them worse.</p>

      <p sl="fr">With the adoption of the Garriga report on the political and budgetary challenges facing the European Union after 2013, Parliament is anticipating, much too timidly in my view, the debate to come on the future financial prospects of the Union. This report reiterates its opposition to pitting against each other the different policies that fall within EU competence and insists on the need to mobilise sufficient funds, consistent with the EU 2020 strategy. It sends a clear message to Member States: we intend to support strong integrated policies and to do this by increasing the budget by at least 5%. Furthermore, in a context where citizens are subjected to austerity, we must maintain a strong cohesion policy. That is what we propose in this report, with support for the plan to create an intermediate category of regions, which will enable a distribution of Structural Funds that is more in accordance with the real economic and social situations of our territories. Finally, the Union must grant itself financial resources that match its ambitions. We have therefore reiterated our desire to introduce a tax on financial transactions, a project which is widely supported by the public and which would encourage greater support on their part for the European project.</p>

      <p sl="it">By voting for the Garriga Polledo report, the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development, first and foremost, the Europe 2020 strategy, for which adequate resources are needed. It is important, in fact, to remember the added value of the European budget, which can act as a driver for economic growth, research and development and employment, particularly for young people, alongside national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report also reinforces Parliament’s position in favour of new financial instruments, such as the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds, which are an opportunity for the European economy. It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament’s ambition, presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this report insofar as it launches an appeal to set up strong, integrated EU policies. Two other important points received my support. Firstly, the creation of a category of ‘intermediate regions’ within cohesion policy in order to ensure that the distribution of Structural Funds matches more closely the real economic and social situation of the territories; and secondly, a renewed call for the creation of a tax on financial transactions as a new resource to safeguard European economic policies. At a time of austerity policies and when unbounded financial speculation persists, it is fair to require the financial sector to play its part in relaunching an economy that has been battered by its irresponsible behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The resolution adopted by the European Parliament is our first contribution to the debate on the future financial perspective. I wholeheartedly support the proposal to increase the European Union’s budget in the upcoming budgetary perspective. I believe that the European Union needs an ambitious budget, which will correspond to the challenges facing us. Reducing or freezing the European budget, as proposed by some of the Member States, is not a good solution for the European economy. The European budget must be a budget which will support the Member States as they exit the crisis, and which is also able to respond to unexpected events more flexibly. I also welcome Parliament’s support for the idea of categorising some areas as intermediate regions, in order to ensure that their further development is promoted despite the fact that they exceed the currently binding criterion of 75% of the European Union’s GDP. Introducing this category will help regions which are still contending with many development challenges even though they have exceeded the EU average and, in the near future, this will include Polish regions.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I believe that the EU budget must be given sufficient resources to be able to finance the commitments that have been decided upon. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that the EU ought to have an attitude of restraint and provide these resources by means of redistribution within the existing EU budget. I do not believe that the overall size of the budget should increase. I would prefer to see the agricultural budget reduced in favour of the priorities of research and development and the conversion to green energy, etc. set in the Europe 2020 strategy. Therefore, I also do not believe that the 2013 budget level for agriculture should be retained, but would welcome the distribution of agricultural aid evenly between the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also believe that it is very important to improve the efficiency of the EU’s administrative expenditure, and one way of doing this is to increase the transparency of the process for distributing and using this expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I do not believe that the own resources ceiling should be revised, as it should be possible to finance EU policy within the current income ceiling. I also see a need for a review of the EU’s own resources system. The current system is very complicated and lacks transparency. The rebates have not made the system any fairer, but instead have given rise to a number of new exemptions and corrections. However, a change in this system does not give the EU a direct right of taxation, as the Treaty does not provide for any such competence for the Union. Any change to the own resources system also requires all Member States to give their approval in order for it to enter into force.</p>

      <p sl="sv">In the vote on the report on the EU’s long-term budget in Strasbourg on 8 June 2011, we Swedish Conservatives in the European Parliament chose to vote against the proposal. This was because the proposal does not set priorities for important and less important expenditure, which we consider to be necessary. Instead of showing leadership and focusing on what will bring growth and competitiveness to Europe, the proposal calls for an increase in the budget of 5% so as to avoid the need to prioritise. At a time when the EU Member States are fighting massive budget deficits and growing national debt, the European Parliament is choosing to demand more money for the EU. This is a line that we cannot support. We should instead phase out the subsidies for the common agricultural policy (CAP) and the Structural Funds, but unfortunately, the proposal that was voted through goes in the opposite direction. While we voted against the report as a whole, we welcome the wording in the proposal concerning a ‘significant increase’ in appropriations for science and research. This is something that we have worked hard for and its inclusion is a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I voted for this resolution because the statement identifies the main problems and priorities for the EU in the new Multiannual Financial Framework. I should particularly like to emphasise the call contained in the resolution for the Commission to present proposals for an effective and efficient EU common agricultural policy (CAP), which would more fairly distribute direct payments between Member States and farmers, and strengthen the link between delivery of public goods to society and support payments to farmers. I fully support the call for the funds allocated to the CAP in the budget year 2013 to be maintained at the same level for the next financial programming period also, so that the CAP can fulfil its expanded objectives and tasks. The new EU financing system must be more transparent, simpler and fairer. That is why I support the proposals for the system of national contributions, which places disproportionate emphasis on net balances between Member States instead of on the principle of European solidarity and the European common interest, to be slowly replaced by the Union’s own resources, which the Union would collect directly and independently of national budgets.</p>

The report suggests increasing the tax burden on European citizens, and I cannot agree to that. One can agree that Europe must have its own finances and that this can be done by tax collection. However, this would require the creation of a federal Europe, which should be done through open debates, and not through the back door using tax policy. If we wish to continue in this direction, we must first ensure that Member States agree to renounce their tax revenues for the good of the European Union, and only then would it be possible to create a self-financed common budget. To make this type of decision, European politicians must involve society, which has not happened in this case.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I supported Mr Garriga Polledo’s report because I found its general outlines justified in the light of the challenges that the European Union is to face over the coming years. It is unrealistic to transfer new responsibilities to Europe without increasing the financial resources on which it can draw.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would, however, have liked the European Parliament to move beyond the stage of legitimate demands and set a certain number of priorities. The ‘ever more’ refrain of a number of my fellow Members is too glib a response. What we need is to be convincing about the effectiveness of European expenditure compared with national expenditure. Furthermore, the qualitative dimension of expenditure is at least as important as the quantitative one. Finally, the transfer of funds unspent at European Union level to the EU budget rather than returning them to the Member States represents a source of considerable ‘savings’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors have been asked to pay up two and three times over. In future years, real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees. This will have to be financed by the net contributors, in other words, the hard-working citizens of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria, from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries. Demanding budgetary increases in this difficult situation is scandalous. We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors. Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Farming subsidies, the largest and most contentious budgetary factor, should be renationalised. This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector.

I could not support this course of action, although I am an ardent supporter of a tax which would provide the EU with its own revenue. A European tax will guarantee that the EU’s goals can be accomplished, without the constraints imposed by the positions of the Member States, which too frequently sacrifice the EU’s interests to short-term goals. However, I believe that it is unwise to propose the introduction of a tax on financial transactions in the European Union alone. We are faced with the challenge of making the European economy the most competitive in the world and, in my opinion, it is unacceptable to create a burden which will result in the outflow of capital from Europe. Similarly, I believe that attempts to introduce a carbon tax as an alternative to FTT are exceptionally harmful.</p>

      <p sl="lt">We must establish a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) that would ensure the transparent and efficient financing of EU policy and would prevent a repetition of the crisis. The Europe 2020 strategy should be the implementation reference for the MFF. Above all, any new system for financing the budget should not increase the burden on national treasuries or the tax burden for citizens. In order to reduce EU citizens’ dissatisfaction with current expenditure, it is necessary to improve the quality of the implementation and application of expenditure. We must increase transparency in the allocation and use of funds and reduce administrative costs and bureaucracy. Significant attention should be paid to reducing poverty and unemployment, to industry and energy, and the creation of a knowledge-based society. We must provide for adequate financing for large-scale research and development projects. Given the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the appropriate financial resources must be put towards improving their operating conditions. I do not agree with the proposal to reduce the financing allocated to the common agricultural policy in the future because agriculture is a particularly sensitive sector. Reduced financing will have particularly negative consequences for farmers in all EU countries. The European Social Fund should become a political priority in order to achieve social and employment goals. We must improve systems for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of cohesion policy. As we approach a new stage of EU enlargement, the MFF must provide for properly balanced expenditure.</p>

I do not believe that a reference to the tax on financial transactions should be included in this report. A debate about this tax is important, but it requires in-depth analysis. The addition of an intermediate category, on the other hand, would compromise the horizontal approach for Objective 2 regions, which has proven to be effective in recent years, the phasing-out system and funds for Objective 1 regions. This would hurt Italian regions to the benefit of regions in the new Member States which, with the recent enlargement, have already received a huge share of funding.</p>

In this context, I commend the author of the report for the proposal of a seven-year MFF, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, subject to mid-term review, advocating, as a minimum: the maintaining of the EU budget, with particular emphasis on the common agricultural policy (CAP) and on cohesion policy; a greater sense of flexibility, which becomes more necessary as the financial constraints become more tangible; and also greater democratic responsibility, so that European funds can genuinely promote development projects that are capable of being sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, it is important that regions that have already emerged from Objective 1 are able to move to an intermediate stage, reinforcing the development which they have already proven themselves capable of, instead of them being abruptly abandoned, jeopardising the progress that has been achieved in the meantime.</p>

In a context where populism is on the increase, the effectiveness and even relevance of EU policies are regularly brought into question. Nonetheless, in the face of current crises, whether financial, economic, social or climatic, we do not need less but rather more Europe. This report therefore proposes finally giving the EU the resources to match its ambitions, by arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget of a minimum of 5% and a mobilisation of the budgetary resources of the Union for the benefit of the EU 2020 strategy. Thanks to action by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the European Parliament also argues in this report for two strong measures: as far as revenue is concerned, an in-depth reform of the own resources system, in particular, through the creation of a tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax); as far as expenditure is concerned, the creation of a category of ‘intermediate regions’ to increase solidarity between the territories of the EU and ensure a fairer distribution of the regional policy’s Structural Funds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Renegotiation of the EU budget will impact on how the Union operates in the coming years and on the programmes it can afford. The budget as a percentage of the EU Gross National Income should reflect the agreed priorities of the European Union. But the negotiations must also reflect Member States’ needs in light of the consolidation efforts under way in many countries, including Ireland. The aim to boost employment, productivity and social cohesion in the Europe 2020 growth strategy cannot be discarded because of the current financial problems. Productivity-enhancing policies, particularly those in green energy and research and development, must be recognised as the driver of the EU’s economic future. Another issue of major importance, not just to Ireland but to the EU as a whole, is the common agricultural policy. It is recognised that significant change is coming after 2013, but changes to payments under the CAP should gradually evolve to allow farmers to adjust to the new arrangements. At the same time, the CAP budget must help European farmers adapt to new challenges and opportunities.</p>

This innovation is apparently one of openness and greater financial flexibility, but in a period of austerity and budget restrictions like the present, it will inevitably lead to cuts in funding for other regions, particularly Objective 1 (convergence) regions, which specifically include the regions of southern Italy. I note with regret that my fellow Members failed to pick up on this aspect and have allowed themselves to be influenced by reasoning that goes against the principles of European solidarity.

While the EU budget is a major political lever, the ceiling on the EU’s own resources has remained unchanged since 1993. This resolution calls for the European budget to be allocated resources equal to the EU’s ambitions. I am wholly in favour of this idea and give it my support. Personally, I am particularly in favour of implementing the European tax on financial transactions as quickly as possible, if we cannot have an agreement at world level. Although I am not entirely in favour of the resources released in this way being allocated to the Union’s budget, as I think that the Millennium Development Goals should benefit, at least in part, I wished to vote for paragraph 171 to send a positive signal to the Commission and the Council regarding the implementation of this tax.</p>

As my colleague, Bas Eickhout, said before, freezing or decreasing the EU’s budget post-2013 is not a credible approach if the EU and its Member States are serious about achieving the policy priorities they have set themselves, notably in the Europe 2020 strategy. Coordinating EU funding and actions is clearly a better way for us to achieve our common goals, as opposed to individual actions. We welcome the fact that MEPs have clearly set out their stall to this end ahead of the forthcoming debate on the future financing of the EU. The EU needs a proper and predictable system for financing its own budget in order to end the perpetual, damaging squabbling over national contributions to the EU budget.

I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green’s amendments, particularly around the Green New Deal, the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU, and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty.

This range is unacceptable to me because it offers the prospect of payments to few areas that require support, including in the western part of the EU. This goes against the actual aim of regional support, namely the strengthening of the weakest regions.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is a perfect opportunity to show European residents that the Union can achieve long-term goals, such as stimulating strong growth and internal cohesion. We must not miss such an opportunity. I am pleased that the rapporteur stresses the importance of cohesion policy for growth and employment. For Lithuanians, it is crucial that the sums earmarked for cohesion policy in the next MFF are not smaller than those in this financial period. European cohesion policy continues to play an important role in reducing significant social and economic disparities among the Member States. For instance, Lithuania’s GDP per capita remains low (when we joined the EU, it was 48% of the Union average). However, it is believed that by 2020, Lithuania’s GDP will be at least 50% greater than it was without cohesion policy assistance.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Lithuania’s goal of improving transport infrastructure and accessibility (23% of the entire allocation of Structural Fund money), enhancing its R&amp;D capacity (22%), and supporting business creation, depends on cohesion policy. Dwindling cohesion policy funds will continue to crush our economy. We must not allow this to happen. Trust in the EU will only return when our citizens are convinced that the Union serves their values and interests.</p>

      <p sl="en">By passing this report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 468 to 134 (with 54 abstentions), the Parliament confirms that it is living in a different world from the harsh economic reality of our times.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Treaty has not conferred any power on the Council to deal with national constitutions of the Member States. Under Article 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the European Union, the adoption of a constitution remains in the exclusive competence of the Member State concerned. Therefore, the Council has not been in a position to discuss the newly adopted constitution of Hungary.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, at President Barroso’s request, I am addressing the House here today on the subject of the Hungarian constitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the outset, President Barroso stressed on various occasions that the Commission does not make political judgments on the fundamental constitutional and institutional choices of a Member State. The adoption of a new constitution in a Member State is a matter for its people, for its institutions in accordance with the applicable national law and, where relevant, Union and international law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission may, however, assess the constitution – as it may any other legal act of a Member State – from the perspective of its compliance with Union law. It goes without saying that the constitution of every Member State should reflect and comply with the European values of freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human dignity and respect of human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, without discrimination, as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new Hungarian constitution will enter into force on 1 January 2012 and will require the adoption of implementing measures. Therefore, at this stage, the Commission can only make a preliminary analysis, as the precise view on the interaction of the constitution with Union law and its legal effects can only be fully evaluated when taking into account the implementing legislative, administrative and judicial practice based on it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also following the work of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe on this matter, and we are expecting a report on 17-18 June. I also know that Thomas Markert, the secretary of the Venice Commission, was in the Committee on Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 25 May, and I read with great interest the remarks which he made.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have already explained, all the matters discussed at that time are linked to national competence. We can become competent only when such matters are translated into legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I now want to listen to what you parliamentarians have to say in order to understand the position of the European Parliament on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, please do not regard my attitude as impolite but I will address the left of the House: the majority comprising Greens, Communists, Socialists and Liberals, who forced this topic on today’s agenda in contradiction with the PPE and Conservative groups. I have questions for you.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Do you find it compatible with the prohibition of discrimination based on birth that the European Union has Member States, such as Spain, Belgium or Sweden, where citizens are entitled to hold high-ranking state positions, for instance that of the monarch, based on their birth? My country’s new constitution does not apply such discrimination. Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States, for instance the United Kingdom, that do not have a unified written constitution? My country’s new constitution is a democratic, written constitution.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States, for instance France, whose constitution does not contain fundamental rights? My country’s new constitution not only contains fundamental rights, but it is the first in the European Union to take the European Charter of Fundamental Rights as a standard. Do you think it is acceptable that the Union has Member States where there is no constitutional court, or where there is one, but its powers are weak? My country’s new constitution is proud to guarantee a strong constitutional protection.</p>
      <p sl="hu">You claim to act in the spirit of a common Europe when you drag the new Hungarian constitution here for dissection. In effect, however, you are betraying one of the most important principles of the Treaty of Lisbon, namely Article 4(2): ‘The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional’. If you have not organised or will not organise debates concerning the states I have mentioned above, or failed to remember here, in the European Parliament, that the socialist government of Hungary blatantly ignored the right to assembly in 2006, then you, ladies and gentlemen, are using double measures. You can see the mote in your brother’s eye but not the beam in your own. You do not realise that you are not supporting European cooperation with this attitude, but you are provoking conflicts between the European nations. This reveals your real partisan bias.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would suggest you follow the example set by the new Hungarian constitution in your countries. Curb indebtedness by constitutional methods to prevent another Greek, Irish, or Portuguese crisis from happening. I suggest you protect with constitutional methods the rights of future generations, just as the new Hungarian constitution does, raising environmental, budgetary, and demographic sustainability to the level of constitutional principles.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Protect your nationalities and minorities, for instance the Roma, with strong, collective rights, just as the new Hungarian constitution does, uniquely in Europe. You keep repeating unjustified charges, although we have disproved them and have proved our position time and time again, but I am telling you once more: the new Hungarian constitution does not ban abortion. The new Hungarian constitution does not prejudice the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience. The new Hungarian constitution does not restrict the rights of same-sex people. The new Hungarian constitution has no competence beyond the country’s geographical area and provides unparalleled, strong legal protection for the nationalities within its area. The new Hungarian constitution does not weaken, but strengthens the principles of division of power, and checks and balances. The new Hungarian constitution is a European constitution in spirit, born in the spirit of ensuring all fundamental human rights to its citizens, and of cooperation and unity of nations. In our constitution, there are 18 references to Europe, and we included ‘Unity in diversity’, the motto of the European Union, in it as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, we, Hungarians, are a nation that likes freedom and democracy. We do not need to be lectured about democracy by those who have plenty of homework to do in their own backyards.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the European Union is a union of values and a union in law. It is defined as an instance of supranational integration of Member States, each one of which is a reputably constitutional state. There is also a constitutional dimension to the European Union itself, however, insofar as not only is the architecture of its institutions subject to the law but there are also guarantees enshrined in law to protect the position of individuals with regard to the government authorities in Europe, and there exists an essential principle, that of democracy, which exalts pluralism.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is surely why this revision of the Hungarian constitution is being debated in the European Parliament and has been the subject of consideration by two of this House’s committees in particular, namely, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE).</p>
      <p sl="es">I think the primary concern can be summarised as the one underlying the impression that what is certainly a very large political majority, a two-thirds majority, but nonetheless a circumstantial political majority in the Hungarian Parliament, has succeeded in forcing a constitutional reform that places constraints on the achievement of political pluralism and, consequently, on the possibility of alternating between different political projects under the same set of rules of play. I think that is why it has caused concern, from the point of view of its concordance with the principles enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union and with the political dimension of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">No one has sought to prejudge what the Hungarian constitution will be or how it will be applied in practice and it will, of course, be subject to the checks and balances provided by the constitutional system, the constitutional balance of the Hungarian constitution itself and the fact that Hungary is subject to supranational bodies such as the Council of Europe and the European Union, which know about fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must refer, however, to what I have just heard regarding the protection of minorities under the Spanish constitution, which has been set up as an example to some other constitutions that have been mentioned by Mr Szájer. I cannot overlook this. With all due respect, I must inform Mr Szájer that no shadow of discrimination by reason of origin or birth exists in the Spanish constitution. No one is seeking to prejudge the outcome of the implementation of the Hungarian constitution but I do think that this Parliament is concerned that the Hungarian constitution must also adhere to the rule of accreditation of political pluralism and the alternation of different political projects under the same set of rules of play. This debate and those that have preceded it are testimony to that concern.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the new fundamental law of Hungary – one would say a far too controversial text for a constitution – has been rushed through the Hungarian Parliament after only one month of public consultations. Hungarian civil society and the Venice Commission have expressed serious concerns regarding the duration and transparency of the process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sometimes, those questioning this text have been accused of doing so for purely political reasons. One expected the new Hungarian constitution – 20 years after the fall of the Communist regime and at a time when Hungary holds the Presidency of the European Union – to entirely reflect the most cherished values in the EU. Are these only political values? I admit that as a Liberal, I am worried about government eroding civil liberties and democratic control. I am worried about legislation turning a blind eye to diversity, and I am convinced that not all Hungarian citizens recognise themselves in the conservative image portrayed by the constitution.</p>
      <p sl="de">How could I remain indifferent about a text on pluralism and the concentration of power in regulatory authorities such as those set out in the still fresh Hungarian media law? We should all worry about democracy when a ruling party passes laws that cement its power well beyond the end of its term and limits the relevance of future elections, and about political leaders going as far as writing or amending fundamental laws that fit only their political credo or economic policies. And yes, I am worried about the spill-over of these Hungarian patterns.</p>
      <p sl="de">My own country’s leaders have been inspired by these actions, and some recent amendments to our Romanian constitution seem to be copied and pasted. They will not be approved, but the attempt is there. European institutions must not be shy at such times. We need to strive to make all European citizens feel not worried but reassured that our values are at the core of our legislation and are there to stay.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, this debate is an evaluation of the situation regarding the new Hungarian constitution, not the common law of the United Kingdom which has protected our citizens for nearly 900 years. It is the Commission which is charged with assessing and acting on such issues as are laid out in the Treaties, and as requested by this Parliament only a few months ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">This House was hoping to ask the Commission what its conclusions are and how it intends to proceed, and we still look forward to your guidance, but it seems we have to wait a little bit longer. This is a Union of different cultures and differing priorities. However, we all share values of freedom, fairness and equality for every person and every Member State. What we should not tolerate is intolerance itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we ask now is for you, Commissioner, to give this House, as soon as possible, a definitive answer as to whether the Hungarian constitution is in line with European legislation and fundamental rights. If it is not, what next? If it is, Commissioner, we need to know that, too, as soon as we can.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I thank my fellow Member from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) who wants to start a debate with us here about the Hungarian constitution. That is laudable, because when I hear the representative of the European Council say ‘We have not discussed this in the Council’, and when I hear Commissioner Reding say ‘A country’s constitution is up to that country alone and it is not for us, at European level, to interfere with that’, then I am glad that we in the European Parliament are, indeed, having this debate amongst ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Are we really not supposed to get involved? Is this a purely Hungarian affair? I would not say so. The state of democracy in a Member State of the EU does concern the other Member States. If a country chooses to use a fair election and a two-thirds majority to create an autocracy, the rest of us are allowed to be shocked by that and to try and oppose it. I quote György Konrád here, who says: ‘In Hungary, a so-called majority knows how to create an autocratic regime in a democratic way’. That is true. If you push a law through the Hungarian Parliament and decree that, from now on, it may only be amended with a two-thirds majority, you know that it is not going be easy to amend it again after the next election. This sort of thing erodes the function of elections as a democratic instrument. It is the right of a nation to say every four years, ‘We liked this, but we did not like that’, and to then bring about changes. However, if a democratically elected regime sets things up so that no amendments can be made for many years after, that is unhealthy and wrong. If we in Europe avert our eyes and say ‘This is purely a Hungarian affair’, if 26 Member States are not prepared to say, ‘Friends, we do not treat people like that in our society’, and if the European Commission says the same, what should we then say, as a group, to countries where the situation is even worse? What should we tell those Hungarians who are not part of the two-thirds majority? ‘Terribly sorry, you will not have any chance to reverse these laws after the next two elections, either’. I find it absolutely appalling that all of us in Europe are averting our eyes and that we are failing to take action.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in this debate on the Hungarian constitution, we have, in fact, been having two debates. One is on the debate on the content of the constitution, and the other is a debate about the debate; in other words, on knowing whether it is legitimate or not to make pronouncements on the content of the Hungarian constitution in this Parliament or in any other institution outside of Hungary itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regarding the debate on the content, we know that there are many parts that are of concern to us in Parliament, to the specific committees that have debated this document, or to the Venice Commission, for example. The issue of non-discrimination … Mr Szájer tells us that it is not true that discrimination against, for example, gender or sexual minorities is not provided for, because there is a reference to all types of discrimination. As far as I am concerned, that reference is too vague and leaves too much room for subsequent court judgments contradicting it. It should be stipulated in the constitution, as is the norm in European countries, and as is the norm in the most advanced and progressive democracies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The same goes for the foetus, the protection of the foetus, or, for example, for the Hungarian Republic’s checks and balances. However, we then have the debate about the debate, and the debate about the legitimacy of this issue being pronounced on in Parliament must also be fought very clearly. This is because, firstly, constitutions are not watertight. It needs to be said that wherever there are violations of fundamental rights, the 500 million citizens expect the European institutions to make pronouncements. Whether that violation is made by a law, by a constitution, or by a regulation, is irrelevant: wherever there is a violation of fundamental rights, it is not permitted under the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, the explanation that, due to cultural differences, a constitution may be, let us say, free from criticism, is pure constitutional relativism. That cannot be the case. The fact of a constitution violating the spirit and letter of the Treaties, if that were the case, means it would be violating the sovereignty of the other 26 countries that have agreed to be in a European Union with the country that was able to violate the Treaties. It is therefore an issue for the sovereignty of all.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to take this opportunity to just say one thing. The two-thirds majority – very often invoked here, and which, in fact, comes from 50% rather than two thirds of the votes cast by Hungarian citizens, since they make up two thirds of the Members of the Hungarian Parliament, but only 50% of the votes – serves for one thing everywhere: to confer a broad social consensus on the constitution. Those in power in Hungary have just used the two-thirds majority for exactly the opposite purpose: to exclude the opposition, ensuring that the constitution is extremely controversial in their society. It may be following the letter of the two-thirds rule, but it is violating its spirit.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the revised Hungarian constitution of April this year has become the subject of justified criticism by the whole of European democratic society. It has introduced into the Hungarian legal system provisions which ignore international law and are in direct conflict with the accepted international obligations of the Hungarian Republic.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The ruling Fidesz party has introduced into the constitution versions of texts through which Hungary usurps the right to decide on the status, rights and political organisation of all Hungarian-speaking citizens in surrounding states. It has also reserved the right to provide all of these citizens of surrounding states, who have no links to Hungary whatsoever, with Hungarian citizenship, the right to vote in Hungary, the right to social security or education under Hungarian regulations and universal Hungarian diplomatic protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Under international law, the organisation of a political system is a sovereign matter of sovereign states, and therefore we cannot view the provisions of the Hungarian constitution under which Hungary reserves the right to decide on the organisation of the life of citizens of other states as anything other than a primitive and crude attack on calm and peaceful coexistence in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The idea of one nation, one empire and so on is not new. This swarthy little Hitler, who has abused it for the last time in his desire for power and glory in Europe, was long ago condemned by the decent, civilised and democratic world.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, I think that Parliament should apologise to the Commissioner for getting her involved in this debate. This is because it has become patently obvious to everyone in this Chamber from what she said – at least it is basically to me, but I do not know whether it has become clear to everyone else – that new legislation implementing Hungary’s constitution still needs to be adopted, and then it will become clear whether anyone’s rights are being violated.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We are in a situation once again where a debate is going on here in Parliament intended to condemn a Member State for something which it has not yet done. Fellow Members, in which of your Member States is anyone judged for something which they have not done? Or condemned for something which they have not done? None. This is something that contradicts democratic values.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The people who initiated this debate must apologise not only to the Commissioner, but also to all European citizens, because it is precisely this kind of behaviour from Parliament which leads to a lack of interest from European citizens in its activities, disappointment and low voter turnout in European Parliament elections.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this debate on the Hungarian constitution today is flawed for two main reasons. It singles out one Member State out of 27, and it concerns a national issue which falls within the sovereignty of Member States. First of all, if we are going to discuss the content of a constitution, we should not single out one constitution of one Member State. We should, if anything, debate the constitutions of each and every Member State. Some of the elements which are being contested can, in fact, be found in a number of other constitutions in other Member States, and yet we are only debating one constitution in one Member State. This is wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, one has to ask what power, what competence, do we have to bring the issue of a national constitution to the European Parliament in the first place? Member States have a sovereign competence for establishing their own national constitutions, and in this case, we should respect the right of the Hungarian people to determine their own constitution adopted by their democratically-elected national parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The debate we are having today on the content of this constitution should, if anything, be held amongst Hungarian people, and not in this House. Whether we like it or not, whether we disagree or agree with this national constitution, we must respect the sovereignty and the hierarchy of law, otherwise we would be setting a dangerous precedent.</p>
      <p sl="en">So when we single out a Member State, and when we try to act outside our competence, we send a wrong signal. We would stand accused of political instrumentalisation, and we would be undermining the trust of citizens in our own institution. We should not go down this dangerous road.</p>

Our comments and concerns are not directed towards a criticism of Hungary and Hungarian citizens, but we firmly believe that the defence of fundamental rights, civic freedoms, our shared European values, and peace, security and decent coexistence is a sufficient reason for us to hold this discussion today.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We also hope that the discussion and presentation of our questions and concerns can lead to improvement and to better preparation of the implementing legislation mentioned earlier. Commissioner, just like you, we want to stick to the procedure ensuring that this entire process is conducted correctly, and we await the final opinion of the Venice Commission, although it is now clear from the preliminary conclusions presented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by the Secretary of the Venice Commission, Mr Markert, that the current Hungarian constitution is, in a number of points, controversial to say the least. Weak points have been seen in the Hungarian constitution not only by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but also by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If we ignore the Romantic, almost monarchist ideas which pervade the spirit of the preamble, I would like to mention some areas we regard as being highly sensitive, in contrast to our fellow Members from Fidesz who are also Members of the European Parliament. One example is the principle mentioned earlier for adopting the constitution. It is not very normal in democratic countries for a consultation process to last only five weeks. It is not normal for the opposition not to participate in it, and, despite the fact that Fidesz has the necessary majority, it has to be said that victors have a duty to show humility.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The restriction on the powers of the constitutional court has already been mentioned, and on behalf of our group, I would also like to mention the discriminatory nature of the constitution in relation to members of sexual minorities, as it fails to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The protection of Hungarian minorities abroad, to which Article D applies directly, also applies to people of Hungarian ethnicity living in neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, the mission of the European Union is surely for us to live together as nations and as states of the European Union in peace, cooperation and mutual respect. How should we, from the countries directly affected, perceive this constitution? How can you expect us to accept it?</p>
      <p sl="sk">Unlike you, we have always extended the hand of friendship to you, and we have always wanted decent coexistence, and we would therefore like the implementing regulations for your constitution to respect the sovereignty of neighbouring states in the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is untenable to say that the constitution of a Member State is a matter only for itself. The Treaties, in Articles 6 and 7, make it crystal clear not only that the Union and the Member States share certain values, but that the Commission has the duty to police respect for those values.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wholly subscribe to what my colleague, Renate Weber, eloquently said: I do think it a bit rich for those of the same political persuasion as the ruling Fidesz party in Hungary to accuse critics of that constitution of being politically inspired. Many of the provisions of this constitution are very partisan, such as the omission of protection of gay people from discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I want to give a good example of one flaw in the constitution that undermines the Treaty’s insistence on the rule of law. This is the declaration that the 1949 constitution is invalid. Not just repealed, but invalid. This creates great legal uncertainty as it leaves in limbo, and apparently invalid themselves, laws passed under that constitution including in respect of Hungary’s accession and EU membership.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one reason why the Commission should examine it for compliance with EU law and it could have a great effect on other Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the new Hungarian constitution demolishes the pillars of a democracy based on the rule of law and opens the way to autocracy. This is a major setback on the road of transition. The process of preparing and adopting the new constitution was hardly legitimate. The preamble is exclusionary and reflects a distorted interpretation of history. The main text represents an intrusion into private life, basic human and citizens’ rights are defined in a narrow way, social rights are substituted by state objectives. Checks and balances are weakened, especially the independence of the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council, Parliament and Commission cannot ignore these violations of European values, because this may set a negative precedent for other illiberal regimes to follow. Nevertheless, the democrats of Hungary do not expect the remedy to come from abroad. Were it to happen that way, it would only reinforce the view of the Hungarian Prime Minister, who compared the EU to the Soviet Union. The solution can come only from the Hungarian citizens, who will reject this constitution when they realise that an autocratic regime cannot provide high living standards and more freedom. Twenty-one years ago, we were not required to fight for freedom. Now we are. In the meantime, Europe should keep its watchful eye on Hungary and encourage the Hungarian democrats to regain the initiative.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I strongly disagree with all of those who have said that it is not respecting sovereignty if we debate and criticise a Member State’s constitution here, or that it would, as somebody has said, be a dangerous precedent and acting outside of European competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The constitutions of Member States have to be in accordance with European values, with our value community which we have defined. There are at least two things I would like to mention which are not in line with that. Others have mentioned others.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first is that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is not included and that has to be included in the future. Also, marriage and family values as defined there go beyond the reality of people living in Europe and in Hungary, and it is not the rule of diversity that we have.</p>
      <p sl="en">One other thing relates to the so-called Green Ombudsman for the rights of future generations on environment and sustainability. This post is now subordinated to the general Ombudsman, as other Ombudsmen have been, and so it is weakened. This is also an area where competences are taken out of the sphere of regulations that were there before, and it makes clear that the issue of sustainability, environmental protection and the rights of future generations – another part of European values – which needs to be important, is no longer as important as it was before.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last point: there was also an Ombudsman on data protection. That post has been abolished totally, so transparency of information about the State, for example on public procurement, is not there anymore. This is something that is heavily criticised by me and by my group.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mrs Lunacek, I would like to ask you whether you can list the Member States of the European Union whose constitution includes the institution of an ombudsman or commissioner for the rights of future generations. How many Member States have such an institution as the one in Hungary that is actually functioning and is mentioned in the Hungarian constitution? Also, assuming you have read the current Hungarian constitution, the new Hungarian constitution adopted in April, can you name constitutions which contain more and farther reaching articles on environmental protection and future generations than the new Hungarian constitution?

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my reply to Ms Gál is as follows. The issue was not a comparison with other Member States’ constitutions. The issue was: what is a European value? What is part of our fundamental rights? What is enshrined in the common values that I hope you share as well?</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the rights of future generations, environmental sustainability is something that is enshrined in the rights of our common European Union. Some Member States have that and others might not have it, but the fact is that in the new constitution, the government of Hungary has abolished this symbolic Ombudsman. There is now only one Ombudsman and the symbolic value, stated in writing, is no longer there. You know how important symbols are in politics as well. That means that you do not want to have this symbolic representation, either at the political or the Ombudsman level.</p>

I do not mind laughter, I like humour, but the issue is that, with the new constitution in Hungary, this Green Ombudsman has been abolished and he has been subordinated. All the four Ombudsmen or Ombudswomen that existed have been subordinated to one general office of the Ombudsman. The issue of sustainability of future generations is not as visible as it was before and that is the criticism I have.</p>
      <p sl="en">My country does not have such a post. Of course, as a Green, I would fight for that, but you have written a new constitution and this abolishes a symbolic and a political value that I guess was important to you, as you say now. Why did you abolish it then? Why did you not keep it there so that everybody could see a Green Ombudsman who is in favour of the rights of future generations, environment and sustainability? You have not explained that, colleagues.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly astounded by the instrumental tone of this debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thinking back also to the recent statements made by Mrs Lunacek, I will refrain from discussing, for example, the topic of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In my country’s constitution, there is no mention of this issue, and so when will the European Parliament be holding a debate on the Italian constitution? Moreover, it is rather strange because, in my country, the only party that wants to change the constitution is Mr Berlusconi’s centre-right party. For 15 years, the response of the Left has been that we must not change the constitution or it will be the end of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Be careful then because, when we open a debate on what a constitutional text does or does not contain, perhaps we should first of all clear up a misunderstanding. Do we really think that the fact that this constitution mentions the rights of the unborn child constitutes a risk for modernity? Do we really think that the fact that the Christian roots of a country are mentioned in this constitution constitutes a risk for identity?</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as I am concerned, I think we should all familiarise ourselves a little more with the text of the European constitution, which did not actually materialise but which had the motto ‘United in diversity’, and try to be a little more tolerant of the fact that everyone is different. In other words, we have to understand that at the moment, a broad consensus in Hungary has highlighted the needs of a people, and in order to avoid those needs turning into nationalism, it must be supported by a strong Europe that recognises everyone’s rights and duties.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the Treaty on the European Union states that the European Union is based on respect for freedom, democracy, rule of law and human rights. These values are shared by the Member States. The Copenhagen Criteria are based on these values, which also form part of the accession conditions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European institutions are also responsible for ensuring that Member States comply with these principles after accession, as well. Let me remind all of you of this responsibility and, in particular, the President of the Commission and the Commissioner who bear primary responsibility in this respect. Neither the contents of the new Hungarian constitution nor the circumstances of its drafting comply with these basic principles. Therefore, the questions related to this matter can be considered European, not national issues.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One single party adopted this constitution, without public or professional consultations, and its draftsmen have dubious democratic legitimacy. The democratic opposition parties requested legal guarantees that the new constitution would be based on broad public consensus, and in the absence of this, they withdrew from the constitutional process. The two main tasks of the constitution are to ensure human rights and proper functioning of the state. However, the framework for the proper functioning of the state is problematic. According to the new constitution, amendments to the tax system, the pension system and family support system must be adopted by a two-thirds majority. This will impede the candidates of subsequent elections to promise changes concerning these matters, and will impede the voters in free election.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Furthermore, the constitution invests the Budget Council, a body that is not elected directly, with the power of veto over the decisions of Parliament concerning the budget, which, in turn, may result in the dissolution of Parliament and a call for new elections, thereby threatening stable governance. The level of protection of human rights is decreased. Human rights will be enforced less effectively, as the competence of the constitutional court is limited.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The most important acquis of the EU is that by its values, it has been able to channel conflicts which, in the past, could only be solved at the cost of considerable human suffering into a democratic framework based on the rule of law. The EU offers to and demands from its Member States a clear framework for the rule of law, constitutional guarantees, institutional checks and balances, and negotiated solutions. These values should be preserved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in this House, we have discussed media freedom being under pressure in Italy, Slovakia and Hungary. We have discussed the violation of LGBT rights in Lithuania, Hungary, and Poland. We have discussed the expulsion of and discrimination against Roma people in France and Italy, and there have been many other examples of debates about fundamental rights being under pressure in one Member State or another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every single time, I have heard the EPP say that this should not be party politics and that we should not single out Member States. This is not about Member States, this is about fundamental rights. Fundamental rights is not a matter of subsidiarity. Fundamental rights is about the very foundations of the European Union. In order to demonstrate this, I remind you that we ask candidate countries to adapt not only their laws but also their constitutions in order to be admitted as members of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, colleagues, there are objective concerns that have been expressed not only by political parties but also by the Venice Commission, and, at the very least, there are ambiguities. Instead of having this very acrimonious debate, we should try and clarify the issues.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental human rights are universal, which means that they are applicable in every situation. I have been listening to the debate. None of the speakers so far, including the critics, has quoted the constitution to indicate exactly what it is they do not like. Mr López Aguilar says that he gets the impression that something has gone awry, while others are making insinuations about all the things that could go wrong with this constitution. Not one person has actually quoted from the constitution itself. That is precisely the problem that faces us in this discussion: where are the actual accusations? When I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being bandied about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quotations, then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country’s development are being discussed here to be extremely arrogant. As Europeans, we should take care to avoid leaving ourselves open to such accusations.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty. It is simply unacceptable that accusations should be continuously made against these people and that the impression should be created that they are experiencing problems with freedom. This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate, I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: ‘We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation’. I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution. This may not please all Members of this House. I am pleased that this reference to Christianity has been included and I would also have liked to have seen it included in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the European constitution. My position, as a representative of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is that this is a good thing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we are not simply discussing domestic problems in the European Parliament. European values are being questioned in the new Hungarian constitution. Therefore, we have to discuss it and have to do so now. There is still time before the adoption of the generic laws. I hope everyone agrees that the constitution has to be balanced, close to the citizens, based on generally accepted values and principles, and should be party neutral. Sadly, the Hungarian constitution does not fulfil these criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even the adoption of the document is questionable. There was no, or very little, social consultation. The text is only supported by one political party and it is opposed by major constitutional experts. The new constitution raises questions on an international level. For example, there is a lack of reference to EU law in the closing provisions. We note clear differences, and comparing the text to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the text shows inconsistencies and differences in values and principles. The principle of good governance does not prevail in the document either. The constitution fails to provide an EU-conforming, modern, administrative structure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aforementioned generic laws are very dangerous. They make governing the country almost impossible for any future government. We have the impression, as one of our colleagues has put it, that the government is like a football team trying to change the rules and the referee during a game. This is not the way to treat political opponents and this is certainly not how democracy works in the 21st century in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I have a lot of sympathy with the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in other areas. We work closely together on economic issues. However, in this particular case, we must make it clear that we should not play party politics here. Above all, we must emphasise that it is scandalous to criticise the constitution of a Member State in this forum, whichever Member State that may be.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are Member States, and here I am looking at Mr Busuttil, among others, since he brought up the issue so forcefully, who seek the support of the European Union when they experience problems; it is an expression of European solidarity that we should provide help when, for example, Malta experiences a problem with refugees. However, solidarity must be based on shared values, and all of the groups within this House are responsible for sustaining such values.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although the Charter of Fundamental Rights may only be binding on European legislation and its implementation, Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the Treaties are binding on all Member States. A two-thirds majority was cemented into the Hungarian constitution, so that, realistically speaking, any future Hungarian Government will be unable to amend any of the country’s laws. This goes against the principle of parliamentary democracy. This limiting of the powers of the constitutional court is something quite unique and threatens the principle of the separation of powers. We cannot discount the possibility that there is a breach of international law in relation to criminal proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is so much I could say, but I certainly wish to state the following: it is not just the right of the EU and the European Commission to make their voice heard in this case; it is also their duty. In the past – even long before the European Union existed – Europe too often held back on criticising abuses in Member States. My country, along with others, has experience of this. When the politicians remain silent, sooner or later the people will make themselves heard and then we need to ask ourselves whether it is too late and whether we have failed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, many thanks for your question. I accept the criticism that I have dealt in generalities in the minute’s speaking time allocated to me. However, I can provide more concrete examples. European values are one thing; however, European values also mean, for example, that a Member State should operate on the rule of law, which entails issues such as the separation of powers and the democratic principle. When, for example, a constitutional court has no jurisdiction in budgetary and taxation matters, this constitutes a restriction in the separation of powers and is unquestionably a dubious situation. Accordingly, I believe that we can discuss such issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the other questions, such as the two-thirds majority, I must ask to what extent this is compatible with parliamentary democracy if future governments no longer have any room to manoeuvre. It is certainly open to question whether life imprisonment without any right of appeal or judicial review by the supreme court is compatible with the principles of democracy and the rule of law upheld in the European Union. These are questions that need answers and I believe that the Commission must investigate.</p>

      <p sl="de">If you were now to tell me that the German constitutional court could not decide on tax issues, for example, following a judgment by the German Federal Court of Justice, or if budget law could not be examined by the German constitutional court for example, by way of a constitutional dispute between government institutions, such as a party in the German Bundestag , then I would agree with you.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to refer to something that was mentioned before; the rights of future generations. It looks very unique in the Hungarian constitution, something that is being enshrined in the Hungarian constitution, and recognised seemingly also here.</p>
      <p sl="en">This raises a question I would like to ask about the basic right of those eventual members of future generations – to be born . Is caring about future human beings a European value – or not? Maybe not European, only Hungarian? Then Europe should look to Hungary with gratitude for reminding it of some fundamentals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I hold Mr Landsbergis in high esteem. However, I am unable to find a question in his speech. If this was not a question, then I will use the time to make a statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as I am aware, no constitution defines the law for future generations. That is not the issue at stake. What we are dealing with is human dignity – this is a principle found in the German constitution, as well as others – and the Hungarian constitution is no different in this regard. I cannot see a contradiction here. The question is whether this is to be restricted or defined in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, as I said before, I failed to understand your question completely. Sustainability, the protection of future generations, the desire for a healthy natural environment and the protection of quality of life – all of these are principles that, if I am not mistaken, can be found in the constitutions of all Member States, and that have been upheld in many supreme court judgments. I believe that this principle was never questioned by you, even during your time as President.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would like to reassure my fellow Members and Mr Alvaro that Hungary is a state where the rule of law still prevails. I would like to reassure Mrs in ’t Veld, Mrs Göncz and Mrs Benova that Hungary still respects fundamental rights, human rights and the values of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hungarian laws and the constitution adopted in April comply with the laws and basic values of the European Union. Hungary is maintaining all her international legal obligations and commitments and, in fact, this is clearly stated in the text of the constitution, and if it were not the case, then the Commission would take it to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to challenge it in a formal procedure; but we all know in this Chamber that this is not the case. Fellow Members, the question of what is included in the constitution of a country and what is dealt with at a different legislative level by a certain Member State is something that is quite clearly a matter of national sovereignty.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In a democracy based on popular representation, it is up to the MPs elected in free elections to decide which areas should be dealt with at a constitutional level, and which areas should be dealt with at a general legislative level.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What I do not understand about this debate is that up until now, we have been taught that laws that can be modified by a two-thirds majority are there to provide a guarantee that they cannot be abused. We need a two-thirds majority constitution because this is a rule that provides guarantees. Now we hear that many raise objections against the very two-thirds majority that they had previously seen as a guarantee. I personally feel that you are incapable of accepting the rules of the game of democracy. In addition, as my colleagues have already pointed out, the new Hungarian constitution refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a new constitutional element, and considers the minorities of Hungary as an integral part of the Hungarian political community. The Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations said that it elevates environmental protection and responsibility for future generations to an outstanding level. The way we speak about this constitution, we could be talking about any other European constitution. You always talk about difference, and emphasise that if something reflects a different value, it does not mean that it is better or worse. It is simply different, and as a Hungarian, I would be grateful if you could respect this in the spirit of unity in diversity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, no, in fact this is basically quite simple. Having heard from others that other Member States should put their own house in order and examine their constitutions, perhaps Mrs Gál could quote an article from the constitution of one of the Member States of the European Union that she would categorise as an example of an area where a state needs to ‘put its own house in order’. After all, it was Mrs Gál who explicitly stated that that is what other Member States should do. In other words, where is the specific criticism of the constitution of another Member State that needs to be addressed? Once we have this information, we can, of course, get down to discussions.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mrs Gál, I would like to give an answer as to why the previous rule stating that amendments to the constitution could only be accepted with the support of a four-fifths majority of MPs had to be changed. This rule, which had been accepted by a parliamentary majority that obtained 72% of the votes between 1994 and 1998 to protect the rights of political minorities and the opposition, was abolished by Fidesz. What was the reason for this? The opposition did not participate in the work in the absence of this guarantee; it was not a case of being deprived of this right, as this rule had been changed.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new Hungarian constitution really is perhaps the most reactionary constitution in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sk">That is one side of the issue, but the other side is that it is also dangerous on an international level. Some honourable Members here have said that this is a sovereign matter for Hungary. That is true, but this constitution violates the sovereignty of other states. Commissioner, this is a matter of the utmost importance. It undermines the peace settlement of Europe. It undermines borders between states. It openly takes advantage of minorities in neighbouring countries for extreme nationalist ends. It is saturated with the spirit of Greater Hungary. In the context of granting citizenship on a purely ethnic basis, regardless of residence, employment or family ties, it opens a Pandora’s Box of extreme nationalism such as we have not seen since the end of the Second World War. That is not all. It makes it possible to grant voting rights to Hungarians permanently living in neighbouring countries. Can you imagine Hungarian political parties mounting an election campaign in another country? In short, the new Hungarian constitution will lead to the total destabilisation of Central Europe. It brings the spirit of the Balkan wars to Central Europe. The Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament, László Kövér, recently said in connection with the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros dam that military intervention was required from the Hungarian side, and that the Paris Peace Treaties did not apply to Slovakia, and he also questioned Slovakia’s borders in the context of the spirit of this constitution.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I think it is time for both the European Union and European Parliament to declare a decisive ‘no’ to this dangerous nationalistic policy, while there is still time.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a fascinating debate, and yet I should like to say, perhaps rather bluntly, that we should not confuse the issue. This afternoon, I have the impression that we are moving away somewhat from political hypocrisy because it is not a question of criticising the constitution of a Member State of the European Union such as Hungary which, of course, is in sole charge, with its people, of its sovereignty. However, in this Parliament, it is a question, and in my case, a concern which relates to the EU legal system, and consequently an issue that affects the degree to which we share our common values, and to which we share how Europe has been built, by States and by the fundamental texts of the Member States and other national founding texts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, there are contradictions concerning non–discrimination, the respect for minorities, problems of pluralism, and concerning opposition, which appear to be challenged. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, if everything is straightforward, as some of the speakers here this afternoon appear to be saying, let the executive college ascertain whether the Hungarian text is compatible and legally compliant with the foundations of our EU platform, and things will be clear. The credibility of the EU legal system, and consequently of the European Union, depends on it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a passionate, exhilarating if somewhat controversial debate, but nevertheless, I am certainly enjoying this expression of democracy. It has to be said that we are entitled to discuss this matter because Hungary is part of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">But Hungary is also entitled to have a constitution and certainly this is far better than the old constitution of 1949 brought in by the Communists. It is a genuine effort to reflect modern values within the European context. While people will argue with some elements of it, it has to be stated that a constitution can always be amended by way of referendum and, if we find at European Union level that some aspects of it are not in keeping with European law and values, that can be done and taken on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has to be said as well that this constitution was passed on 18 April with 262 votes for and 44 against and that is an expression of democracy. People have objected to some aspects of it, for instance, to the references to Christianity and to God, but this is nothing new. These are found in the German, Polish and Irish constitutions. As a Christian-Democrat, I am absolutely delighted that there is a reference to God and Christianity, because it is a fundamental part of our culture and our history and I think it is far better to have it included than excluded and creating a godless society.</p>
      <p sl="en">People have also objected to granting citizenship to people outside of Hungary, but in Ireland, we have had passport facility for people who are officially living in Northern Ireland, which is in the United Kingdom. This has helped the situation more than it has detracted from it and we now have a better relationship with the United Kingdom than ever before, expressed by the visit of Queen Elizabeth two weeks ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">People have objected to the definition of marriage, the definition of life and so forth but, as I have said, if there are flaws, they can be addressed in a referendum. Finally, they are to be commended for including a limit to the extent of state debt, which is very important. If we had had that in our constitution in Ireland, we might not be in the mess we are now financially. So there is an awful lot of good in it and I think that if we are thinking of having a new constitution, we can learn a lot from what Hungary has done.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are a number of problems with this constitution, but I want to focus on one key issue, which is that the proposed constitution does not give any protection from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The only type of marriage that would be recognised would be one between a man and a woman. We have had a long fight across Europe for LGBT rights, and we cannot allow Hungary to take this retrograde step.</p>
      <p sl="en">Gay rights are protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Not only that, but married couples of the same sex should be able to move freely around Europe and have their partnership legally recognised wherever they are. Yes, it is for Hungary to decide the Hungarian constitution. However, each Member State has the responsibility to respect the European Community that they are part of. The protection of LGBT people is fundamental to the European Union, and Hungary cannot disregard that.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, today’s Europe is based on values that unite us and that enable us to cooperate and respect one another. I would also like to emphasise that every state has the right to adopt its own constitution through democratically elected representatives. The new Hungarian constitution, however, opens up issues that are sensitive for its neighbours and which affect them. I am talking, for example, about Article 23. This foresees the possibility of members of the Hungarian minority in neighbouring states acquiring the right to vote, on condition that they obtain Hungarian citizenship. It is here that the problem lies. The unusual criteria established for acquiring Hungarian citizenship, in other words, without a natural link to Hungary, creates the possibility of political links coming into existence between a state and citizens who have no real link to that state.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also see problems in the formulation of Section D. There is talk here of a single Hungarian nation, of collective rights, of support for their self-rule in other countries on the principle of ethnicity, on the responsibility of Hungary for all Hungarians. Thus, in paragraph 4, there is room for possible extra-territorial impacts of this constitution.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Slovak Government is striving for a peaceful, businesslike discussion of these issues on a bilateral level. It meets with rejection, however, from Hungary. Since the constitution has not yet come into force, I therefore think that this is the right time to discuss it and to explain what the negative impacts might be.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to say one more thing. In our current policy on EU expansion, we are trying to emphasise the settling of neighbourly relations between the future states on the basis of our European values. Ladies and gentlemen, imagine what the reaction of the Union would be if Serbia, for example, decided today to grant citizenship en masse to citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or if Albania granted citizenship to citizens of Macedonia. I would like to say one more time that only in a situation where there is mutual respect for values and cooperation can we talk about continuing the joint development of the European Union in the future.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I have asked for the floor three times already and I am glad you managed to give me the floor upon my third request. First, I would like to make a correction. There was a question about whether the constitution contained that particular fourth-fifths majority or not. It was included in the Standing Orders of Parliament, but it was abolished at the proposal of Fidesz. What I would like to ask Mr Kukan is that when Mr Markert was here from the Venice Commission and the two-thirds majority was mentioned – which keeps coming up here as well – he confirmed that the two-thirds majority does exist. In such cases, self-restraint would be a fundamental expectation, but he can see no sign of it. So my question to Mr Kukan is whether he has already discussed with the Fidesz members sitting in the European Parliament the issues he has raised. Does he see any signs of willingness to make changes to these points in the constitution?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new Hungarian constitution drafted by the Orbán government is not lacking in rather striking articles, as my fellow Members have pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The chapter on private life appears to be the high point of a constitution that is based, as we have noted, exclusively on Christian religious references and traditional family values. It would appear that this text also allows the right to abortion in Hungary to be restricted by stating, and I quote, ‘that the life of the foetus will be protected from the time of conception’. The Hungarian Government has backed up its words by action in this area by launching an anti-abortion communication campaign which would still, apparently, appear to be using funds from the European PROGRESS programme (Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity).</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when the European Union is holding up progress and gender equality as common fundamental values, it is somewhat surprising that these European funds should be involved in a campaign of this nature.

By amending the constitution in that way, without really involving other parties or civil society organisations, it is undermining the democratic process, killing off dynamism and threatening to impose the exclusive right of a single party. The majority at the expense of the minority. A true democracy is tested and judged on how that country treats its minorities. One minority, in particular, the LGBT community, will be especially affected by a constitution which, in the 21st century, is harking back to antiquated ways of life.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Mrs Bozkurt, to answer your question, everyone received this letter in which they could express their opinions. Thank you for this opportunity for a debate, because this way I can tell you what an immense pleasure the birth of the Hungarian constitution has given me. It is a painful fact that the 20 years that have elapsed since the fall of communism were not enough to create a new constitution. We have brought this transitional era to a close now and established a new constitution based on national consensus. Our new constitution is the collection of our shared values; it starts with our most beautiful national prayer which also emphasises the importance of our common European values, and it finally places the appreciation of our Christian roots and family – our key values – where it belongs. It is more than reassuring that in the new constitution, the Hungarian state takes responsibility for its citizens both within and outside its borders, does not allow state debt to run out of control, and, among other things, it declares parents’ responsibility for their children.</p>

Secondly, we, MEPs, cannot have a say in a matter of national competence. However, now that I was given the floor, I would rather not criticise, but make a recommendation on behalf of 80 million people living with disabilities. The Hungarian constitution is the only European constitution that includes special provisions and assistance for people with disabilities. So I would suggest you include similar provisions in your respective countries’ constitution. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner Reding, I am addressing you. It is obvious that the Hungarian constitution in itself would not have generated such a wide European debate, but unfortunately, Hungary is back on the agenda again after six months, when we looked at the media law. In fact, it is not the constitution itself, but the anti-democratic practices that have taken root in Hungary: judges, policemen, and people paying into private pension funds are deprived of their acquired rights. Commissioner, what is the underlying reason for divesting the constitutional court and the ombudsmen of their acquired rights? They are threatening the independence of the courts; they have already snatched the independence of the media. These are all extremely important and extremely dangerous elements. Commissioner, I would like to hand over to you the 30-page criticism of the Venice Commission. This body formulated extremely serious criticisms and I really hope that the European Commission and you in particular, will finally take its duty seriously, because you should be the guardian of the European Treaties. Please, do your job!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, this debate reminds me of another debate, held several months ago, on the media laws in Hungary. Both that debate and this one are merely a pretext for attacking Hungary. European political correctness cannot bear the fact that there is a country in which conservatism is triumphing, that there is a country in Europe where national interests are being effectively protected, and that there is a country in Europe which is returning to real values. This is an attack on the Hungarian Government for having successfully rescued the country after half a century of bankrupt Communist governments and their political offspring. Now it is the turn of the constitution. While European political correctness is forcefully dissociating itself from its Christian roots, the Hungarians have dared to take pride in enshrining them in their constitution. While Brussels is promoting cosmopolitanism, Budapest is emphasising its heroic national past. Hungarians are focusing on national identity, their own state and common sense. The world is finally back to rights. Communism is described as a tyrant, and marriage is at last a union between a woman and a man. I hope that future generations of Hungarians will be proud of this fine constitution.</p>

My fellow Member, Mr Boştinaru is not in the Chamber anymore, so he cannot reply, but I would like to answer Mr Szájer that I, as a Romanian citizen, do know that Romanian citizens living outside the territory of Romania can vote and can have passports, and, similarly to the Slovak constitution, many European constitutions lay down the rights of their citizens living outside their borders.

I belong to those who were not given mass Hungarian citizenship, because this will be granted to those who lodged their application individually. The reason why I asked to take the floor is the belligerent tone that some colleagues have adopted. I am extremely worried about the fact that the Hungarian constitution is assessed as if it were an attack against peaceful cohabitation in Europe.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the Socialist initiative can be described as having three main characteristics: it breaks the law, it is cowardly, and bears the characteristics of show trials. It breaks the law because the European Parliament has no licence or competence whatsoever to examine the Hungarian constitution. It is clear from the letter of Mr Barroso and the statement of Mrs Reding that this is within national sovereignty. It is cowardly because if the Socialists had found anything to contest, they would have turned to the European Court in Luxembourg and would not be debating here. They have not done so, because they know exactly that they would lose the Court case. And finally, both the procedure and the initiative bear the characteristics of show trials because there is only one thing in the background: Fidesz winning the elections by a two-thirds majority last year. The Socialists – apparently not only the Hungarian, but also the European Socialists – have not been able to swallow the decision of the Hungarian citizens, so they take every opportunity to attack the Hungarian Government.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it has to be said that the hypocrisy and double standards in this debate and in the criticism of the Hungarian constitution are striking. On the one hand, accusations have been levelled at the constitution because it does not refer to God and Christianity, and because it offers no protection for what are known as homosexual marriages. Yet such accusations could easily be made regarding a great many European constitutions, including the Polish constitution, for example, which also contains such provisions, or does not contain them in the latter case. This is exactly as it should be, for this is a domestic matter for Poland to deal with, as laid down in the EU Treaty. We should not violate our own Treaty on European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The drafting of the constitution has been accused of being undemocratic, yet people are ignoring the fact that the vast majority of Hungarians supported this constitution. This hypocrisy is also apparent from the way in which those protesting so loudly today against Hungary and its Prime Minister, Mr Orbán, were silent when the previous socialist government in Hungary in practice brought its country to the brink of bankruptcy, using force to silence the opposition when it protested at democratic rallies and gatherings. This is not a matter in which we should get involved.</p>

There are also some points in my own German constitution that I do not fully agree with, likewise the French constitution. However, this has nothing to do with this House, because it is not responsible for such issues. That is the crucial point. That is, unless is it specifically established that some provision is in breach of European law. If someone does not like a particular element in a national constitution, this has nothing to do with this House, because this is a matter of national identity and jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Just as the Commission forced changes in Hungary’s media laws because some points were unacceptable, so it or the European Court of Justice will take action if laws are passed when implementing the constitution that breach European law.

This case established a precedent that weakens genuine supporters of Europe and strengthens Eurosceptics. This is irresponsible behaviour.

I made it very clear: this campaign is not in line with the Progress programme and it is not in line with the project proposal submitted to the Commission services by the Hungarian authorities. Therefore, the Commission asked for this part of the campaign to be stopped without further delay and for all existing posters to be removed.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, today we find ourselves debating the issue of the European Arrest Warrant. It is high time that this discussion was brought to the table. We have submitted a question through the groups tabling a debate on the reform of the European Arrest Warrant and its application, and are asking the Commission and Council to respond with proposals.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Arrest Warrant was trumpeted as the perfect example of mutual recognition in the area of justice and policing. When the European Arrest Warrant was passed as a framework decision, the European Parliament always made it perfectly clear that, on the one hand, the conditions for applying the European Arrest Warrant are relatively strict, so that it should apply only to really serious crimes, that it should be applied in a proportionate way, and that the procedural standards in the European Union should be harmonised at the same time. None of these requirements has really been met in full. In many specific cases, the Arrest Warrant is not applied in a proportionate way, as we can see in the reports now available to us. Thus, we need to adjust procedures, both in practice and in legislation. Thanks to the work of Vice-President Reding, after ten years, we are finally making progress in harmonising procedural standards. However, it is essential that we should make numerous further advances, including in relation to the conditions under which prisoners are held and the question of individual standards of legal protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">In future, our sole concern should not just be the cooperation between the police and judicial authorities as regards mutual recognition; we must also look at the establishment of procedural standards. Nonetheless, the European Arrest Warrant must be amended today, as its application is obviously incompatible with the standards we have called for, particularly in terms of the checking of proportionality in individual cases.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, the European Arrest Warrant has proved to be a very useful instrument in seeking justice beyond national borders. It has helped us open up national borders by sending a clear message to criminals that they may no longer flee to another country to avoid prosecution. It is therefore important that the European Arrest Warrant is seen as a useful instrument that has reaped good results.</p>
      <p sl="mt">However, it also has its downsides, such as when it is issued for crimes which are considered too minor for its justification. I do not expect a European Arrest Warrant to be issued because someone is caught stealing two car tyres in another country, as has happened in the past. The punishment does not fit the crime and leads to a lack of trust in an important and useful instrument.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Therefore, we need to look at the defects in the system and in its application, without destroying the usefulness of this warrant.</p>
      <p sl="mt">It is for this reason that we are putting forward this Parliamentary question to the Commission to help us understand how the warrant was put into use these past few years. Such information will help us decide whether we need to update it so as to safeguard its correct application.</p>

    <intervention id="3-619-000" speaker_id="4529" name="Baroness Sarah LUDFORD" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author" nationality="United Kingdom" birth_date="14-03-1951" birth_place="Halesworth" p_group="Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe" m_state="GB">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Liberal Group in the European Parliament has always been supportive of the European Arrest Warrant because of its importance in the fight against serious cross-border crime. However, simultaneously, my group has always pointed out that the European Arrest Warrant system would be incomplete without advancing procedural defence rights in Europe. We have constantly criticised the Council for not progressing that agenda on the basis of the Commission’s comprehensive proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we are finally changing the situation on defence rights, and I applaud Vice-President Reding for her commitment to this programme under the road map. The question is: will this be enough to compensate for the failings of the European Arrest Warrant? I think not. We also have to do something about the way the European Arrest Warrant system operates.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let us just note the successes: between 2005 and 2009, the arrest warrant has secured the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers, child sex offenders, rapists and others. They include Hussain Osman, one of the 2005 London bombers. No Londoner could be ungrateful to the European Arrest Warrant in the light of that. He came back within six weeks, from Italy.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in the UK at least, and we will hear this later, the European Arrest Warrant has become a favourite stick with which the Eurosceptics batter the reputation of the EU. Their cause has been helped by several notorious cases of breaches of human rights. In fact, the UK receives the second highest number of requests for surrender after Germany.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both the Commission and defence rights organisations like Fair Trials International – I declare an interest, I am a patron – and Justice, on whose council I sit, have pinpointed failings in the arrest warrant. Problems with it being used for minor offences, the lack of legal representation in the issuing state, long pre-trial detention periods, the lack of bail for people who are not nationals of the issuing state, and bad detention conditions are all cited with reason. The Commission does not think that we need to recast the European Arrest Warrant. I think we need to reconsider that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we need to have a much sounder basis for the requirement for a proportionality check, so that minor offences are not covered. Secondly, we need to have an explicit human rights check in the executing state. That needs to be made explicit, and not implicit. Thirdly, it needs to be recognised when it is not reasonable to execute a European Arrest Warrant, so that someone is not followed by alerts in the Schengen Information System around Europe even though their surrender has been refused once on valid grounds.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to do something about the bail situation, not least by implementing the framework decision on supervision orders.</p>
      <p sl="en">There do need to be changes to the European Arrest Warrant, but fundamentally it has been a success. Those who question it need to ask themselves whether they would be satisfied with criminals spending years beyond the reach of the courts and beyond the reach of justice, because traditional extradition takes too long and has too much red tape.</p>

    <intervention id="3-620-000" speaker_id="96932" name="Birgit SIPPEL" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author" nationality="Germany" birth_date="29-01-1960" birth_place="Bochum" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, in the debate on the Hungarian constitution, we heard more than once the criticism that it was a political debate. I am completely taken aback by that, because having political debates is one of the things that Parliament is expressly there to do; and I therefore want to start this topic by setting out the political framework too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Crime, and organised crime in particular, has never been held back by borders or border controls. It therefore makes no sense to rebuild borders in Europe and to restrict the way our populations are growing together. On the contrary: what we need is the consistent further development of cooperation between our Member States and cross-border cooperation by the police and justice authorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this area, the European Arrest Warrant has repeatedly proven itself to be an important and successful instrument. At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning. I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State – resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border. That does nothing to help build confidence in European legal systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why is this happening? Does the text of the directive leave too much leeway? Is it a matter of incorrect implementation in the Member States or inadequate information? We need to clarify these points, the Member States need to make improvements where necessary, and the Commission must take action to prevent such misuse. That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, all these experiences show how important it is that we finally make some progress on the road map for procedural rights. In the interests of legal certainty for everyone involved, we need to have the same rights across Europe for those accused of offences and there must be mandatory information on these rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am not sure whether I should answer your question, as it is more of a polemic comment. However, the figures show that the European Arrest Warrant is an appropriate instrument for fighting crime in the unified space of Europe. Crime is not national; crime is international and crosses borders. That is why we need to cooperate across borders. We need to deal with the teething problems of the European Arrest Warrant and stop it being misused. As an instrument, however, it is indispensable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, since 2004, I have warned that the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) could be used as an instrument of oppression against political dissidents. This is what is happening now in the case of Julian Assange. There are many irregularities in the Swedish case against him. Mr Assange has not yet been charged with any specific offence. A previous investigation against him, for what the Swedes designate as ‘minor rape’, was dropped by a senior prosecutor in Stockholm almost four months before the EAW was issued. The reinstated investigation leading to the EAW saw a failure of the prosecutor to interview witnesses that could clear Mr Assange.</p>
      <p sl="en">Independent legal opinion in England has said that the allegations against Mr Assange would not constitute rape under English law. The complainant’s lawyer in Sweden has reportedly stated that the ladies themselves cannot tell if the acts in question constituted rapes, because they are not lawyers. Nevertheless, the tick box on the EAW marked rape contains no definition or explanation of what constitutes the crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Assange remained in Sweden for five weeks to answer the allegations, but he was not questioned as the investigation was unduly delayed. Mr Assange arrived in Sweden less than a month after WikiLeaks leaked the Afghanistan war logs and announced it had many more revelations to come. Senior figures in the USA have called for Mr Assange to be assassinated or kidnapped, and for the US Government to act as if it were at war with WikiLeaks, which they describe as a terrorist organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this coincides with the convenient issuing of a European Arrest Warrant against him. Sweden has a close relationship with the USA in terms of intelligence sharing and cooperation, calling into question Sweden’s perceived neutrality. Why would the USA want Mr Assange to be extradited to Sweden? The Americans are still building a case against him and do not know what they can charge him with, if anything. Without a charge, the USA cannot extradite him from the UK, but they need him locked up somewhere while they work it out, preventing him from returning to Australia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Arrest Warrant offers the perfect expedient. As I have said many times in this Chamber, under the European Arrest Warrant, extradition – or rather judicial surrender, to use the correct term – is now merely a bureaucratic formality. There are simply no real safeguards. Having said all that, my question to the Council and the Commission is not: is the EAW being abused for political purposes? It is: can it be abused? If the Council and Commission are honest, they will have to admit that it can. Will they please do so now? In my opinion, the evidence shows that it is most certainly happening in the case of Julian Assange.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the text of the oral questions might seem abstract and theoretical, but the European Arrest Warrant nevertheless concerns the fates of individuals, human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the Netherlands, much attention has been focused on the fate of Cor Disselkoen. In 1997, this Dutch entrepreneur was charged with breaching the Polish taxation rules. He spent two months in prison for this, in appalling conditions. Having paid a very large amount of money as bail, he was released and for twelve years he heard nothing more about this case. However, last year, Poland suddenly demanded this entrepreneur’s extradition. On this occasion, Poland made use of the European Arrest Warrant. Ten days ago, he was transferred to Poland. Mr Disselkoen’s lawyer says he was held there in a prison which was just as filthy and overcrowded as the one in which he was held in 1997. Contrary to all the rules, the consultation between Disselkoen and his lawyer was recorded with a video camera. In addition, four new charges were suddenly added to his sheet. The judge even insinuated that these could lead to a new arrest warrant. Disselkoen has once again paid a large amount of money as bail and is back in the Netherlands, but his case shows that the European Arrest Warrant may lead to degrading situations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In its report, the Commission has demonstrated that it is aware of the problems and that it is concerned about them. That is why my group is pinning its hopes on the Commissioner. Commissioner, can you personally offer any explanation of how the proportionality requirements should be interpreted and arrange for this to be taken over by the Council? Can you make sure that people will actually be entitled to challenge an arrest warrant in both the Member State which has issued the warrant and the Member State which is carrying it out? Do you agree that it ought to be possible to consistently refuse to carry out arrest warrants on behalf of countries where conditions in prisons and houses of detention remain inhumane, that the EAW will be subjected to a human rights assessment and that Cor Disselkoen need not fear even more misery?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, no one can deny the positive impact the European Arrest Warrant has had on cross-border crime. It has so far contributed to the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers, child sex offenders, rapists and terrorists, and has avoided lengthy extradition procedures in the process. The speed of this tool has been invaluable, given the freedom to cross borders and increases in cross-border crime. However, what this tool was never intended for was to investigate and punish petty crimes such as the theft of a pig, stealing a chocolate bar or exceeding a bank overdraft limit.</p>
      <p sl="en">What you see today is a rare occurrence here. Nearly all political groups and all nationalities collected here are saying that now is the time to review, re-evaluate and, if necessary, amend. Proportionality, protection and redress are the key to reforming this tool.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now currently working on the European Investigation Order, a partner to the European Arrest Warrant. It is essential that we do not make the same mistakes again. We must draft this new legislation with a clear working memory as to the flaws and obstacles of the European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been simply too many examples of substandard conditions for prisoners, too many misplaced warrants and too great a lack of redress for those who have been victims of errors. I fear that we are moving forwards with the EIO whilst its very foundations, and the European Arrest Warrant on which it is based, are decidedly shaky. We need to rebuild the trust in, and value of, this tool and reserve it for only the most serious of crimes, whilst guaranteeing and maintaining the highest of standards in its use.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Kirkhope this question because he agrees that the European Arrest Warrant needs review and re-evaluation – my view would be a lot stronger than that, but never mind. He mentioned the European Investigation Order and I believe he was saying that this could be a step too far.</p>
      <p sl="en">But is he aware that, in his own government, one of the first acts of the Home Secretary, Theresa May, when coming into office was to opt into the European Investigation Order, which means we now cannot opt out and will be stuck with whatever comes through the legislative sausage machine, because this will be subject to qualified majority voting and the final outcome is something we cannot determine? Is this another case of Tory double-speak, where they speak out against the acts of the European Union here but endorse them back home in our own parliament?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the position regarding the UK Government with regard to both the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order is that clearly they feel they have an obligation – quite rightly – to do what is best for the UK in relation to cross-border crime. We have been the victims of an enormous amount of crime, and terrorism in particular, as the honourable gentleman is aware. I am sure that he would share with me our determination to stamp out this crime, and working together across borders is the best way to achieve it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the European Investigation Order needs careful implementation. But merely opting into it and to the concept of it, as has been done by the government, is not, of course, the final shout. What we need to see here is the detail of this order; we need to implement it effectively and make it work well alongside the Arrest Warrant. But the fact that we have opted in is a good indication that we are determined to deal with cross-border crime. I trust the honourable gentleman shares our wishes in that regard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Arrest Warrant has become one of the most successful instruments on mutual recognition adopted within the European Union. Therefore, I am very thankful to you for having initiated this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council has devoted a great deal of attention and energy to this issue, not least through a mutual peer evaluation of the practical application of this instrument which has been carried out in all Member States over a period of three years. The advantages of the European Arrest Warrant by far outweigh any possible inconveniences. Thanks to the EAW, the Union has managed to reduce surrender times considerably, in many cases from one or two years to only one or two months. The previous extradition system was cumbersome and no longer fit for purpose in the modern world of open borders and serious and organised cross-border crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of proportionality, whilst there have been some cases of minor importance for which a European Arrest Warrant was issued, it is ultimately a matter for the issuing authority in each Member State to decide for which offences it wants to launch the proceedings. This is a result of the fact that, unlike extradition, the European Arrest Warrant is a fully judicial system. A European Arrest Warrant is always based on a judicial decision in the issuing state and the decision on whether or not to issue an EAW is for the national judicial authority. If there is a proportionality problem, it is not caused by the instrument or by the EAW framework decision; it is rather the result of the criminal justice policies in individual Member States. The Council has been quite clear that in cases where preventive detention is inappropriate, the European Arrest Warrant should not be used.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council has also called on the instrument’s practitioners to consider and seek advice on the use of alternatives to the European Arrest Warrant. Taking into account the overall efficiency of criminal proceedings, these alternatives could include using the less coercive instruments of mutual legal assistance where possible, using video-conferencing for suspects, convoking someone for appearance before a judge by means of a summons, using the Schengen Information System to establish the place of residence of a suspect, or the use of the framework decision on the mutual recognition of financial penalties.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, such assessments should always be made by the issuing authority. The European Arrest Warrants are issued in relation to prosecutions or final convictions in the issuing state. These judicial decisions are based on the material available to the judge or prosecutor in the issuing state.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, we should not ignore the victims. In most cases, the victims of the offence are in the issuing state, not in the executing state, so by delaying the trial and examination of the case, the rights of victims are also being undermined. Justice delayed is justice denied, not only for suspects but also for victims. It is also in the interest of the victims to have a speedy trial so that their rights are respected. The Council intends to adopt a road map proposed by the Hungarian Presidency to strengthen these rights. The solution to the proportionality principle cannot therefore be that we change the fundamentals of the well-functioning European Arrest Warrant system, which has radically improved the prior extradition system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the rights of the defence, I would like first to remark that, unlike extradition, the European Arrest Warrant is a fully judicial system which, in itself, is already a major guarantee. A European Arrest Warrant is always based on a judicial decision in the issuing state and can be executed in the executing state only through a judicial decision. The person will always be able to fully exercise his defence rights in the issuing Member State where the trial on the merits of the case takes place. This is fully in compliance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="en">That does not imply that the person against whom a European Arrest Warrant has been issued is not, and should not, be able to exercise any rights in the executing state. Directive 2010/64 of 20 October 2010 provides for the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings and also applies in the execution of the European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, we welcome the fact that a recent Commission proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the right to information in criminal proceedings provides for the right to written information in European Arrest Warrant proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerns have been expressed that a negative decision on a European Arrest Warrant does not automatically lead to a deletion of the corresponding alert in the Schengen Information System. However, the SIS alert is a means of transmission of the European Arrest Warrant. Ultimately, it is only the issuing authority that has entered an alert that can withdraw it.</p>
      <p sl="en">In cases where a Member State refuses, following judicial proceedings, to execute a European Arrest Warrant, the person in question will be released. If the refusal to execute the European Arrest Warrant is final, it is clear that the person can no longer be arrested in that Member State as a result of the instrument. However, any refusal to execute a European Arrest Warrant does not invalidate it. It remains a valid title for the arrest of the person concerned in the issuing Member State and indeed in any other Member State. This has nothing to do with the European Arrest Warrant system as such and is, for example, also the case under the extradition system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, regarding prison conditions, these may, of course, be open to improvement in some cases, but this is not a topic which is specific to the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant. It is the responsibility of the authorities of individual Member States to ensure that prison conditions are up to standard, regardless of whether persons have been surrendered from other Member States or not.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-629-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viviane Reding" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, you might know that the Commission adopted a report on the implementation of the Arrest Warrant on 11 April this year. This report focuses on the fundamental aspects of the operation of the Arrest Warrant, highlighting for the first time since it became operational in January 2004 not only its successes but also its shortcomings.</p>
      <p sl="en">A lot has already been said about the successes. Let me just underline that between 2005 and 2009, almost 55 000 European Arrest Warrants were issued, about 12 000 were executed, and during that period, roughly 60% of the requested persons consented to their surrender, on average within 14 to 17 days. The average surrender time for those who did not consent was 48 days and this contrasts very favourable with the pre-European Arrest Warrant position of a one year average for the extradition of requested persons and has undoubtedly reinforced the free movement of persons.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why, and I think that everybody in this House agrees, the Arrest Warrant is an important tool to catch criminals and to render our criminal justice systems more effective. It has been instrumental in smashing paedophile rings, and catching murderers and terrorists, and that is what it is there for.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, and this is a recent movement, we see that the number of Arrest Warrants issued has risen dramatically since 2007. In some cases, it is being used in a less than proportionate manner to extradite suspects of often petty crime: stealing a bike or a piglet. This is unnecessary and may damage the legitimacy of this powerful EU mutual recognition tool. That is the reason why the Commission asks for action.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the Commission calls on the EU Member States to exercise a proportionality test when they call for an Arrest Warrant, and to fill the gaps where their legislation fails to fully comply with the framework decision setting up the Arrest Warrant. We also ask the Member States to ensure that judicial practitioners, such as prosecutors, do not issue Arrest Warrants for minor offences.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we will set out in a Handbook on the Arrest Warrant the lines to take at that level. We will also come forward with proposals before the end of 2011 to step up training on the Arrest Warrant for police authorities, judicial authorities and legal practitioners in order to ensure consistency and effectiveness in the way it is applied and raise awareness of the new EU safeguards for procedural rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speaking about safeguards for procedural rights, the report also reflects on the overarching importance of fundamental rights and mutual trust in the Member States’ judicial systems. That is why the Commission has started to set up procedural rights for persons who are taken into custody.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, minimum rules on the right to interpretation and translation, which were adopted already in 2010. Secondly the right to information about rights – the letter of rights – which is going to reach an agreement very soon. Not later than today, the Commission adopted the third proposal on procedural rights, the proposal to ensure access to a lawyer and the right to have a third person notified when a person is deprived of his or her liberty. It will include a provision for access to a lawyer both in the issuing and the executing States in European Arrest Warrant cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these procedural rights apply to the Arrest Warrant. These measures are designed to obviate the possibility that evidence is being obtained in breach of the fundamental rights of suspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to answer the specific question which has been raised by the authors. The Commission is not aware of any evidence that the request from Sweden to the United Kingdom for the surrender of Mr Assange to face allegations of sexual offences indicates that the European Arrest Warrant system is being used for other than its purpose.</p>
      <p sl="en">Surrender under the Council Framework Decision creating the European Arrest Warrant is an entirely judicial procedure where the governments have absolutely no possibility of interfering in the process. In the specific case mentioned by Parliament, the procedure has been handled by the UK and Swedish judicial authorities without intervention of governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the other question concerning possible extradition to the United States, I would like to underline that we are not aware of any request so far in respect of potential extradition to the United States. But if there were a request, this could only happen with the consent of the surrendering Member State, the UK in that case. Because pursuant to Article 28 of the Council Framework Decision, a person who has been surrendered pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant shall not be extradited to a third State without the consent of the competent authority of the Member State which surrendered the person. This is just to underline the legal basis of the question but, of course, the whole question is a ‘what if’ question, because nothing concrete is on the table.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in my view, the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and other forms of crime. It is a proven tool and, according to the Decision, the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses. The weaknesses are perfectly identified, as Commissioner Reding has also said, not only in the Commission’s report of April 2011, but also in its reports of 2005 and 2006. Those weaknesses, which stem fundamentally from two basic and essential premises, can and, naturally, must be corrected. The arrest warrant has two components: issue and refusal or surrender, as appropriate. The figures show that it is a useful tool, with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Turning to the question of what corrections need to be made, what we need are greater and better procedural guarantees around issue, refusal and surrender. The issue of proportionality or the lack thereof in the use of the arrest warrant is critical, a key issue. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences.</p>
      <p sl="es">Incidentally, Mr President, during the course of these questions, one particular item has slipped in, namely, that every arrest warrant costs the Public Treasury EUR 25 000. This is something that was said by an Irish judge. I say to that judge that I do not believe it and that he should demonstrate on what basis such a calculation was made.</p>
      <p sl="es">Consequently, I believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form, with better procedural guarantees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the situation for our group is very clear. We heard on the one hand from the Council that, if a European Arrest Warrant is executed properly and effectively and not in the many trivial cases we have seen, its advantages outweigh those disadvantages.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner set out what is a credible report – a serious report – which tells us that if we can deal with trivial cases and disproportionality and with the procedural guarantees, then the European Arrest Warrant can still be a valuable way of catching serious, organised criminals. We should not forget the 12 000 figure – I feel very strongly about the fact that in my constituency of London, we caught the attempted bombers of July 2005. When we understand the serious and symbolic effect of these cases, the European Arrest Warrant can and should work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The oral question we have today for our group is very simple. We are now in the area of moving from the reports to the action, and we have a situation where we have two hard cases. One is the lack of proportionality. This will not be solved overnight, and I commend the Commissioner (I am talking about judicial training) for ensuring that we fix the issue of trivial cases dominating and creating a credibility problem for the European Arrest Warrant. But that also requires the Council (I am not referring just to Hungary, I am talking about the Member States) to help us in pushing forward the procedural guarantees, and the issue of unacceptable pre-trial detention periods for many citizens in my own country.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are the situations which create the problems for a tool which could be effective if used properly. But the hardest case is going to be creating an even playing field in relation to procedural defence rights. This is why within my group, which has [called for] the letter of rights, we take seriously both the quality and speed of the legislation which we need to ensure that the European Arrest Warrant can be the effective tool that it should be for catching serious, organised criminals, and that its credibility must not be diminished by the many trivial cases and uneven playing field that we currently see.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the position we want to see for our group, and we believe the commitment is here. But we must pay close attention, particularly to the Member States when they ask for the European Arrest Warrant to be effective, but, on the other hand, do not carry out the actions to help us get the legislation to create that even playing field.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Claude Moraes talked about the lack of proportionality, etc. We can all agree on that, but the one thing – the elephant in the room – that nobody has talked about this afternoon is the fact that the court cannot look at the prima facie evidence against the accused person and exercise any discretion about whether they should be extradited or not. We have many constituents affected by this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The most notable case is Andrew Symeou. I sat through the appeal court hearings and heard the judges. It was obvious from the look on their faces that they realised there was no real evidence against this boy; the evidence was contradictory, the statements appeared to have been concocted by the police, and in no way should he have been extradited. How would you address that problem and the fact that the courts cannot take into account the prima facie evidence, or lack of it, against an accused person?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for an arrest warrant, there has to be prima facie evidence. You cannot execute an arrest warrant without the judiciary understanding what the simple facts of the case are.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Andrew Symeou case, the underlying problems, I say to Gerard Batten, were procedural problems: the detention periods and court system after the arrest warrant was executed. You talk about the appeal procedure. It was the period after the execution of the arrest warrant which was problematic, and which we are trying to fix today in this debate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the previous debate was passionate and also fascinating and this one is much more consensual. I get the impression that no one is questioning the effectiveness of extradition, of the European Arrest Warrant, the reduction in the length of proceedings and therefore, in a nutshell, the fight against crime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the way the mandate has been used has also led, as we have all said, to abuses and abusive practices: abusive practices when it is used for petty crime, and here I am not talking about the myriad farcical instances of thefts of bicycles, piglets and the like, and rather more serious abusive practices when there are disproportionate detentions, when innocent people are jailed and when the right to appeal these decisions is abused.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some years ago, the group to which I belong defended the need to introduce safeguards on the use of the European Arrest Warrant and I am pleased to have heard you, Commissioner, this afternoon, mention improvements to the procedure through the creation of guides for the Member States as well as guides for detainees. I welcome this because I think that the European Arrest Warrant is very well understood by our fellow citizens, and is a crucial test in showing just what Europe is capable of in order to consolidate justice in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Union Member States need effective tools for the fight against crime, particularly organised crime, which is the most serious kind. In this regard, it should be said that the European Arrest Warrant responds to a need, particularly in view of the fact that it is not only honest citizens who mostly take advantage of the freedom to move around the European Union, but also criminals, who do not by any means exercise their rights for tourism or business purposes, but for criminal activities, or to avoid being brought to justice in their own country or in the country in which they committed the crime.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The existence and operation of this instrument is therefore to be welcomed, but we should also welcome the fact that it is being monitored. As well as merits, every new legal institution has certain flaws which are worth identifying, and it is also worth thinking about how to remedy them. In this instance, I think that it is worth considering whether restrictions should be introduced concerning use of the EAW for the most trivial crimes, for example, those punishable by up to two years in prison. This should be the subject of serious consideration.</p>

It is often said that Poland is one example of a country where there is no threshold test for the issuing of arrest warrants, either domestically or for European Arrest Warrants.</p>
      <p sl="en">Has a reform in your criminal justice system been considered so that prosecutors have some discretion as to whether to issue an arrest warrant and do not have to pursue every single complaint?

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Ludford very much for her question. We are indeed aware of the problem to which you have been so kind as to draw my attention. Polish courts take a very rigorous approach to these regulations, and also apply them to what can sometimes seem to be trivial matters. In view of the fact that many of our fellow countrymen live in London, for example, warrants are sometimes issued in questionable cases of this kind. In my opinion, it would therefore be reasonable for the Commission to consider introducing more general solutions, which would potentially also apply to other countries, in order to ensure that it would not be possible for the warrant to be issued for entirely trivial matters of this kind, for example, two-year imprisonments, and instead only for the serious punishments for which it was put in place.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am very grateful to Mrs Ludford for asking that question, because it was on the tip of my tongue as well. Last week, I attended the proceedings in Poland against Mr Cor Disselkoen – his name has been mentioned already today. He is a Dutch national who was extradited to Poland on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant for an affair dating back to the mid-1990s. In the few days that he was behind bars – because, eventually, the Dutch and the Polish judges came to an arrangement – in those few days, the guard there stole the medications which he takes for his heart condition.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The problem is not only how the European Arrest Warrant is carried out, but also that prison conditions in various countries in Europe are such that you really cannot carry on sending people there any more. The judge in the country to which the request is addressed should also have the discretion to say: ‘I will not extradite people to a country in which prison facilities are inhumane and, as a judge, I will uphold Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights’. I agree with the Council that countries should be discreet about cases in respect of which they issue such a request, but countries should also have the freedom to say: ‘That is such a minor offence, I am not going to extradite people for that’. Therefore, it is very important for Poland to change the way it administers justice.</p>

However, often they are disregarded. Detention on remand and the detention conditions referred to by Mr de Jong are typical examples. The main reason for this is because it is taken as given that human rights enjoy the same respect throughout Europe. However, this clearly is not the case, because certain rights are interpreted differently from one Member State to another, such as the right to silence, or simply because certain procedures differ, such as the period of detention on remand.</p>
      <p sl="el">What do you intend to do about this Commissioner? Will you propose specific measures, such as the introduction of a special provision on human rights which will allow judges to examine the content of cases, as happens in the United Kingdom and Ireland, or will they continue to simply rubber stamp judgments handed down in other Member States? Will you make provision for the suspect or defendant to be heard, so that the judge can decide whether or not he should be sent back to the country in which he is wanted, in order to prevent abuse, such as extradition for political opinions? Do you intend to propose such changes within the framework of the road map on procedural rights or by amending legislation on the European Arrest Warrant?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the arrest warrant hearings have very little in common with extradition hearings that preceded the 2003 Act. Even at the main hearing, the court does not consider the evidence but only 10 so-called legal bars to surrender. Lack of evidence is no bar to extradition. Even people accused of behaviour that is not an offence in the extraditing country can be surrendered under the European Arrest Warrant if the offence is one for which there is no requirement for dual criminality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst most of these are serious violent, sexual or dishonesty offences, the list also includes the nebulous thought-crime offences beloved in so many continental countries, so that the arrested person could be sent for trial, or rather automatic conviction, to one of those wretched places.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact that such warrants are issued for the purpose of prosecuting a person on the grounds of his political opinions ought to constitute a legal bar to surrender, but I suspect that some political opinions would be less equal than others. We were sold the European Arrest Warrant on a promise that it would be used to send terrorists to justice, but the miscarriages of justice in the case of Garry Mann, Deborah Dark, Edmond Arapi, Andrew Symeou and many others, had no terrorist elements at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Worst of all have been the cases of people being extradited for questioning without a charge having been made. We must reinstate the requirement that a court will extradite a person only when there is compelling evidence that a serious offence under the extraditing country’s laws has been committed.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Arrest Warrant is an effective instrument for combating and controlling cross-border crime at EU level. It has proved effective in speeding up the transfer between EU countries of people suspected of committing serious crimes, including terrorism and organised crime. However, all too frequently, there have been cases where this instrument has been used to deal with minor crimes. Cases which were extremely unequal in severity were given equal treatment. Warrants have been issued when their use was both unnecessary and disproportionate. This has led not only to unjust situations for defendants, but has also created an unjustified burden on the resources of the state executing the warrant.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The disproportionate use of this key instrument for fighting cross-border crime helps undermine confidence in it. This will make some states carry out a proportionality check based on their own rules when they decide to execute a European Arrest Warrant. This will result in it being applied inconsistently and unevenly and, therefore, in a lack of trust in the concept of mutual recognition.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The right to legal aid must be guaranteed in both the state issuing the warrant and the one executing it so that the right to defence is applied in an appropriate manner. This is why we wanted to ask the Commission and Council these questions. We need to have a guarantee that the standards of criminal justice and the prison conditions in the European Union do not result in a lack of confidence among the judicial systems in Member States.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the European Union is an experiment made up of experiments: the euro area, this very Parliament in which we find ourselves, the Schengen area and a number of other instruments are all experiments. The problem is that politicians are very often less humble than scientists. Scientists are the first to acknowledge it when an experiment has not gone as they had hoped.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the case of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), we now know that this has problems and has caused doubts. Commissioner Reding should be credited with having had the honesty to confirm that this warrant has had problems and causes doubts, and that there are proportionality tests, which must be passed when warrants are issued and which should not be applied automatically without a judge having a slower, more measured look at them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, the solution should not be to abolish the EAW, which is clearly useful. We want a rapist or murderer to be unable to cross a border and be free. However, the EAW should be complemented with effective instruments for protecting defendants, with the presence of a lawyer and the right to translation, which Baroness Ludford has already tackled in her report, but also, and very crucially, the assessment of detention conditions in European prisons.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, let us not fool ourselves or be under any illusion: being detained in a prison in country A or country B is not the same thing as being imprisoned in Europe. It is very important that these conditions be assessed and that there be very determined work by the European Commission to assess detention conditions, so that they can be harmonised and so that, in this way, the EAW can be applied with more confidence.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I have previously heard the arguments put forward by the critics of the European Arrest Warrant from the mouths of my fellow Members from the nationalist movements as well. However, our arguments were presented then as being Eurosceptic, as if we were some kind of enemy of progress. As a result, this warrant came into force.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, this evening I heard something else awful coming from the lips of Mrs Győri. What she actually said was that the effectiveness of the arrest warrant has justified the instances of rights violations. Mrs Győri, I am familiar with a principle in criminal law which states: ‘Better 10 guilty men go free than to convict a single innocent’. However, from the perspective of disproportionate response, it is normal for police officers to use whatever is put in their hands and they will take every opportunity they are afforded.</p>
      <p sl="bg">There is only one answer to the old question ‘Who will guard the guards themselves?’: ‘The law guards the guards’. We as legislators, with the Commission as initiator, Parliament and the Council as colegislators, must do our utmost to ensure that the law really does guard the guards.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the European Arrest Warrant is undoubtedly a fundamental tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. I think that there is an understanding and agreement on this on the part of everyone who has spoken, including the Presidency and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, it is confirmation of how police and judicial cooperation in a cross-border approach to crime can achieve important objectives. Waiting times have been resolved, and the costs will now have to be verified – and this needs to be looked into further. Trust between the Member States is crucial in this process, which is undoubtedly positive. In the meantime, however, it is important to ensure that the instrument is applied uniformly in all the Member States, with a real distinction between serious crimes, for which it is intended and sanctioned, and non-serious crimes.</p>
      <p sl="it">It may be helpful – and here I am addressing Commissioner Reding – to involve the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which, once up and running, could verify and assess in some way these judgments by the Member States’ judicial authorities, who will undoubtedly need to receive further training. It is true that detention conditions are not the same in all the Member States, but we are confident that next week, the Commission will issue the communication and Green Paper on basic detention conditions, which should list additional action to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, with proper use of the arrest warrant, proportionality, strict application of the instrument, better exchange of information and training on European issues for magistrates, we are sure that uniform application of this important instrument can be achieved in full.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we can see that the application of the European Arrest Warrant raises the issue of detention which is very unevenly applied from one Member State to another. Some States show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, amongst the 600 000 prisoners in the European Union, increasing numbers are detained in a Member State other than their own, due, precisely, to the European Arrest Warrant. Consequently, they do not enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by their state of origin. In circumstances such as these, there is no point in hurling abuse at each other; action must be taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, last January, my colleague, Mr Lambrinidis and I submitted a written statement calling for the harmonisation of detention standards throughout the European Union, and the introduction of independent national inspection mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope, Commissioner, that in the Green Papers that you will propose, you will bear this issue in mind, and that there will soon be a common platform of minimum rights which applies to all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Györi, Commissioner Reding, as has already been made abundantly clear by the previous speakers, in recent years, the European Arrest Warrant has proven itself to be a useful instrument for fighting crime. Criminals in Europe are no longer free to exploit our open borders in the way that they might otherwise have been able to.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite the innumerable successes that have taken place, however, the past seven years have also shown that the system is not yet perfect and that it is not being used in the way originally intended. You drew attention to some of these weaknesses in your recent report. For example, there is no right to legal representation, prison conditions are, in some cases, disgraceful and very often the investigations take an extremely long time. The fundamental point, which has also already been mentioned several times, is the failure of issuing states to apply consistent or indeed any consideration of whether the measure is proportionate. This matter is particularly close to my heart because the real intention of the European Arrest Warrant is frequently being undermined by the systematic issue of arrest warrants, often for minor offences. In Poland, for example – as has also been mentioned previously – where the largest number of European Arrest Warrants are issued, the judicial authorities simply do not have the power to stop national proceedings because the system has become automatic. I do not believe that this is what was intended. Before a European Arrest Warrant is issued, therefore, consideration should be given to how serious the offence is, what the expected penalty is and whether there is a simpler way of dealing with the matter. Finally, perhaps a cost/benefit analysis should also be carried out so that minor offences are not prosecuted at great expense.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I see it, consistency also means adapting the existing rules to reality. In this respect, I should be interested to learn what steps you are thinking of taking in this area.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the comments made by my fellow Members. I shall start with our common assumption that combating crime is not just a national issue; it is also a European issue.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Arrest Warrant marked an important step forwards in combating crime, by helping to create a European area of justice and to combat cross-border crime and terrorism. It also strengthens the free movement of persons within the Union, which we debated at great length recently in connection with the Schengen Agreement, by ensuring that opening the borders will not turn out to be for the benefit of those seeking to evade justice.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, voices are also being raised in protest – and I, too, endorse what was said by Mr Voss and other members – about its often unsatisfactory and disproportionate application at national level. We also debated cost and proportionality and everything that needs to be applied in order to strengthen the arrest warrant. However, I would remind the House – this is something that we faced in Greece recently in important cases – that, even now, there are people being prosecuted for serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union who disappear or manage to get off and escape arrest by making use of the different procedural provisions and different regulations in the various national laws. Consequently, I think that there can be no doubt as to the value of the European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to stress that you are right, Commissioner, when you say that we need to make maximum possible use of Interpol and information available from the Schengen system. We need the closest possible harmonisation between the Member States so that, ultimately, we have a harmonised, modern policy which is up to the job, as the times demand.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the aim of the European Arrest Warrant is to enforce the law and ensure the security of citizens in the European Union. Freedom of movement for individuals must not make it easier for criminals to avoid being held accountable for criminal acts committed on the territory of another Member State. There have, however, been alarming reports concerning use of the warrant, such as the recent Commission report and Commissioner Reding’s statement, in which she said that the Member States should ensure that the warrant is used correctly, and that it should not be issued mechanically or automatically for relatively minor offences. This statement bears testimony to the potential for misuse of the arrest warrant by the judiciary. Therefore, although I am entirely in favour of striving to ensure the maximum level of security for EU citizens, I would call on the Commission to monitor use of the warrant and to take steps aimed at preventing irregularities during use of this procedure by courts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I had the honour to be the rapporteur in this House when the European Arrest Warrant was approved in 2001 and 2002. Colleagues who were in the House at the time will recall that we urged the Commission and the Council to build more civil liberties safeguards into the legislation, and we secured from the Commission a commitment to a draft directive on the rights of defendants in criminal legal proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not all of the safeguards we called for were inserted, and the draft directive on defendants’ rights sat for many years in the Council’s in-tray. The results of these omissions are at the root of this debate today. In 2002, Parliament had no powers of codecision in these matters. Nonetheless, we believed that, on balance, the arrest warrant was the right move. As many speakers have said in this debate, the arrest warrant is a hugely valuable tool in the fight against cross-border crime. It has brought justice to many victims. Where problems have arisen, they have come from poor implementation into national law, from frivolous use of the warrant for petty crimes and from unacceptable conditions of detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">All of these can, must and are being dealt with. I salute the authors of the oral questions today, with the exception of one who opposes all judicial cooperation, for speeding up the process of improving it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, personally believe this whole debate needs a dose of common sense now.</p>
      <p sl="en">I still believe that some sort of European Arrest Warrant is a necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the Union, particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving between Member States, including – sadly – criminals. I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small – but still too many. We must now not throw the baby out with the bathwater, which is what some of the colleagues in this House would like.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to seriously review the workings of the arrest warrant to include only a limited list of serious crimes – always satisfying the condition of double criminality – as being the only ones justiciable under the European Arrest Warrant. We must also respect fundamental human rights and include safeguards like habeas corpus .</p>
      <p sl="en">The large majority of UK-surrendered individuals were actually, as it turned out, migrants from other States of the European Union charged with crimes – normally major crimes, not petty crimes. It is ironic that UKIP, which was opposed to their right to come to the UK in the first place, is now trying to make it extremely difficult and expensive for the British taxpayer to send them back to their countries to face justice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in recent years, European Arrest Warrants have been issued for trivial offences, such as the theft of two car tyres or the theft of a piglet. It is no longer being used to fight terrorism and serious crime, as was originally intended.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as I am concerned, the European Arrest Warrant is a clear contradiction of the principle of subsidiarity. It overrides the most important function of citizenship – which is the protection that citizenship affords – and the Member States are obliged to surrender their own citizens. Since the countries of the Union have very differing legal systems, they are obliged to surrender people even if the act is not an offence in the surrendering country.</p>
      <p sl="de">For me, the European Arrest Warrant symbolises the concept of a European state and citizenship of the European Union at the expense of the sovereignty of the Member States and at the expense of citizens’ rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is the first instrument implemented in the European Union that puts into practice the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments. That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so, especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the report on organised crime, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are proposing a series of considerations and requests concerning the European Arrest Warrant. One of the main requests is for the EAW to be strengthened and better enforced by the Member States, bearing in mind the requirements and the specific nature of the fight against organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States’ discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution. With regard to the grounds for optional non-execution, I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime, including the offence of association with a mafia organisation, for which double criminality should not apply anyway.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is general agreement in this House that the European Arrest Warrant is a positive tool and has served the European Union well and acted as a security.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negative elements are in the implementation. Those negative elements have to be eliminated. The proposals which the Commission has put on the table for this purpose are the proportionality test, where we have to look at the seriousness of the offence, the length of the sentence which this offence would carry, and the cost/benefit of executing such an arrest warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to make this proportionality test easier, the Commission will present an amended handbook as a guideline for the application of the proportionality test. Training, which is very high on the agenda for the coming weeks, months and years, will be very important because we have to train judges, prosecutors and lawyers in the application of our European rules. The minimum standards for suspects and accused persons, which are under implementation, are very important because they also apply to the European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with all those parliamentarians who have underlined the problem of prison conditions in Europe. I would like to tell them that next week, the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on detention. National governments are responsible for detention issues and prison management, but the Commission’s role is to make sure that judicial cooperation works and fundamental rights of all citizens are upheld. That is why the Green Paper will kick off a public consultation, which will run until 30 November and will help to explore more closely the links between detention issues and mutual trust in Europe’s area of justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Everybody in this House knows that detention conditions have a direct impact on the smooth functioning of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and are the basis for cooperation between judges in the EU. But the system is impeded if judges refuse – sometimes rightly so – to extradite accused persons because the detention conditions in the requesting country are substandard. We all know about prison overcrowding and the allegations of poor treatment of detainees. These factors undermine the trust that is necessary for judicial cooperation. The time that a person can spend in detention before being tried in court and during court proceedings varies a lot between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a lot of work ahead of us, and I know I can count on Parliament. I hope I can also count on the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you very much for this debate. It is clear that an overwhelming majority says that it is good that we have a cooperation system for our judiciaries, the European Arrest Warrant. The system works. It is not perfect. It should be improved further. We are, of course, open to more efficient use and better implementation. I agree that mistakes, arrests of innocent people, etc., should be avoided. Better implementation is, I think, in the interests of us all.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would be more specific on two outstanding issues which were raised several times during the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, on proportionality: just to make it clear, a European Arrest Warrant can be issued to prosecute offences which are punishable by at least 12 months’ imprisonment, or to execute a sentence to at least 4 months’ imprisonment. This has been standard extradition practice for at least 50 years. It is enough to mention the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the fourth round of mutual evaluations on the practical implementation of the European Arrest Warrant in all Member States, it was found that only in a few countries were there examples of issuing European Arrest Warrants for relatively minor offences. It seems that, in those few countries, the practice was to issue a European Arrest Warrant every time a national arrest order was issued. In general terms, I believe that we should only use the costly system of the European Arrest Warrant for more serious offences. I think that those who mentioned this were right.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning prison conditions: the Member States are under a general obligation to ensure that prison conditions are in accordance with the basic tenets of human dignity and do not violate the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment laid down in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. If people are detained in violation of their basic human rights, they can take action before domestic courts and, later, before the European Court of Human Rights. It is doubtful whether Article 85 of the Treaty provides a legal basis for legislative action at EU level on prison conditions as such. However, we are, of course, awaiting the Green Paper which the Commissioner has just mentioned with great interest.</p>

      <p sl="it">Seven years after the entry into force (on 1 January 2004) of the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the surrender procedures between Member States, the Commission has published some statistical data collected in the Member States between 2005 and 2009. Before the introduction of the warrant, the average time taken to extradite a wanted person was one year, whereas in these four years in which the EAW has been applied, it has been shown that approximately 50% of wanted persons agreed to their surrender after about 15 days.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is essential to take stock of the implementation and operation of the EAW now that doubt is being cast on whether the Schengen Information System is working properly and whether it should be suspended. We should not forget that the effectiveness of the EAW in the fight against cross-border crime, organised crime and terrorism depends on the principle of mutual recognition between Member States, which is the basis for having a real European judicial area and also for the Schengen area to work properly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) was brought in by a 2002 decision and has, to date, been shown to be an effective tool in the fight against cross-border crime, organised crime and terrorism, as was, in fact, stressed by the Commission in a recent report. However, there are imperfections in the functioning of the system: there is a possibility that its reputation and effectiveness may be undermined by news of its use for interrogations instead of charges and prosecutions in cases of petty crime. It is thus pertinent and urgent that the Council take steps to guarantee that the disproportionate use of the EAW is limited in practice. Furthermore, it is advisable to ensure that procedural rights are actually respected: that is, that individuals wanted under the auspices of an EAW have a genuine right to legal aid at their disposal, both in the Member State that issues the warrant and in the Member State where it is implemented. It must also be ensured that criminal justice standards and prison conditions in the European Union do not give rise to the Member States legal systems mistrusting each other. This is the only way we will be able to talk about genuine effectiveness and the true success of this instrument at European level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss with you the next European Union-Russia Summit which will start tomorrow in Nizhny Novgorod. The European Union will be represented by the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission. High Representative and Vice-President Ashton will attend, as will Commissioner De Gucht.</p>
      <p sl="en">The summit has been carefully prepared by the External Action Service working in close cooperation with the Commission and the two Presidents, preparations built on the debates held in the European Council and the Council, on Russia as a Strategic Partner in late 2010 and in January 2011, on the results of the previous EU-Russia Summit, and the visit by the Russian Government to the Commission in February.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, our relations have improved over the last two years. We have concluded bilateral negotiations on Russian WTO accession, agreed on the approach towards a possible future visa-waiver regime, and agreed the Partnership for Modernisation, which is now in its implementation phase.</p>
      <p sl="en">Work is also ongoing in the regular framework of the Four Common Spaces and all its technical dialogues. Our interaction is quite intense. Let me remind you that Russia is the only external partner with whom the European Union holds two annual summits. The visit by Prime Minister Putin and an unprecedentedly large Russian Government delegation to the Commission on 24 February was a clear sign of Russian determination to seek closer relations and cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, many significant bilateral issues remain unresolved. Of particular concern is the situation regarding democratic development and human rights in Russia. In the context of upcoming Duma and Presidential elections, the standards of the electoral process will receive particular attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I would like to turn your attention to our main objectives for the summit, which are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="en">First: the European Union will strive to encourage Russia to resolve the last remaining outstanding multilateral issues to facilitate WTO accession before the end of 2011, building on the EU-Russia bilateral agreement reached in 2004 and last December. Russia can still achieve WTO accession before the end of 2011 if it can take the necessary decisions to resolve the handful of outstanding issues at multilateral level. The summit cannot replace negotiations in Geneva, but it can urge Russia to take constructive action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second: the European Union will impress upon Russia that more progress needs to be made on agreeing substantial trade and investment provisions, including on energy, in the new EU-Russia Agreement in order to provide a solid legal basis for deepened economic cooperation in the years to come. We do not rule out bringing the issue of Russia’s unjustified ban on European Union vegetable imports to summit level, although we hope that scientific evidence will allow a quick solution at an expert level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third: we shall maintain top-level support for the Partnership for Modernisation as an important vehicle for Russian commitments to reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth: we will promote human rights and the rule of law in Russia, and</p>
      <p sl="en">Fifth, we will encourage Russia to deepen cooperation in our common neighbourhood and continue the dialogue on other topical international issues like the Middle East, for example, or North Africa. In fact, progress on Moldova/Transnistria will serve as an important test case for closer foreign policy cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we should also use the summit to reconfirm our political commitment to make progress on crisis management cooperation – provided our decision-making autonomy is in no way affected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Energy also figures prominently in our dealings with Moscow. We will emphasise the need for further reforms in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field. We will also underline the need to cooperate on fighting climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">To pursue our goals of highest standards on nuclear safety, we interact with Russia both at the bilateral level and in multilateral fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the G8.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will repeat our invitation to Russia to engage in negotiations on a comprehensive Euratom-Russia agreement which should promote the highest standards for nuclear safety. With regard to the Fukushima accident, the European Union will push for equivalence of approaches regarding stress tests for both existing and planned nuclear power plants.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last, but certainly not least, we have engaged in a clear process on visa-free travel. The European Union has prepared and agreed in March its proposal for the list of common steps towards the possible establishment of a visa-free travel regime, and we have indeed started negotiations in April. Since then, a Permanent Partnership Council on Justice and Home Affairs has been held and clear progress has been made. But negotiations on our common steps at expert level are, to date, not finished. We must be clear at the summit that there are no political short-cuts.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as Russia is concerned, its main objectives for the summit can be expected to focus on visas, the WTO, energy – including nuclear safety – and security cooperation. Russia might come back to the idea of a new Political and Security Committee at ministerial level. We believe that necessary cooperation structures are in place; what we need is political will to make progress on substance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your comments.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the good cooperation you have shown in the drafting of the resolution. I will not say anything more about the points which the Commissioner has mentioned because they are covered in the resolution. As far as the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the final declaration of the summit next week must be more than just fine words. Russia is our great neighbour; Russia is an important partner. We are mutually dependent and the level of that dependence is great, so now we are expecting real agreements that will lead to results.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What are our priorities? First of all, the Partnership Agreement. We need to set the negotiations in motion. I expect that the EU will persuade President Medvedev to grant his negotiating team full powers to undertake specific commitments. It is high time that we got things moving again on the trade and investment dossier. The negotiations on the energy chapter are also behind schedule. We need agreements on a solid and transparent energy partnership and one which is based on rules.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would also like to hear where we stand on the human rights paragraph. For us, for Parliament, this is a vital part of the partnership. I see the modernisation pact as a complementary issue, in the same way that the common areas are. This is a secondary matter, but it would help if we got the WTO rules through. That would help to establish a level playing field while facilitating the investment climate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">President Medvedev is personally involved in improving the rule of law, but this is not enough, as you have just said yourself. We need to be certain that, in the upcoming elections, Russia is going to live up to the obligations it has undertaken under the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The elections will be the acid test. That, then, also means that new parties must be allowed to register. Russia should feel honoured that election observers have been called in well in advance. Lastly, the import ban on European vegetables (…)</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Russia is undoubtedly a very important partner for the European Union, but – as the Commissioner has already said – a very difficult one. I hope that the negotiations will not take too long. Unfortunately, however, they will not be completed as fast as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten imagines. During the process, we need to have a dialogue both with the official elected representatives and with the representatives of civil society, who are often closer to us on matters of democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The idea of a Partnership for Modernisation between the European Union and Russia is a good one. However, Russia also needs to play its part. We need more democracy and less corruption. We still hear many investors complaining of legal uncertainty, particularly as regards taxes. Above all – as the Commissioner has already mentioned – we need to prepare speedily for Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WTO membership. In the area of energy policy, we need Russia to be obliged to acknowledge the principles of a transparent and fair energy policy. There is a lot that Russia can do itself, particularly as regards energy efficiency, where there remain many shortcomings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also as regards energy, I would like to bring up something that concerns its neighbour – indeed our common neighbour – Ukraine. Right now, Russia is once again attempting to use the issue of energy and energy prices as a political weapon. We must absolutely reject that. We are committed to the freedom of Ukraine to decide in which markets it wishes to be present and where it wishes to operate. We do, after all, want to have trade relations and a trade agreement with Ukraine. Russia should not put pressure on Ukraine in this area by giving it the option of either joining the customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus or paying a high energy price. That is something we reject.</p>
      <p sl="de">Again, as regards neighbours, we also expect Russia to adhere to the agreements in the treaties in respect of Georgia and to withdraw its troops back to those areas where they were present before the conflict. We also hope that Russia will make a positive contribution to resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. On both sides, here it is not a matter of supplying arms, but rather of peaceful mediation between the two sides.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commissioner has already mentioned the importance of visa liberalisation. It is particularly important for relations between individuals that people enjoy as much freedom of movement as possible between Russia and the European Union. I hope that we will soon make some progress on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">One crucial issue, however, will be how the next elections are held. Russia needs to be aware that the world, and the democratic world in Europe in particular, will be watching closely to see how these elections are carried out; whether the parties are registered correctly and fairly; and also whether certain individuals or certain parties are excluded from the elections at the outset. That is something that should be made clear to Russia at the summit. We want to see proper, fair elections in Russia too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Russia still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of its economy. However, Russia is ready for democracy. We want to see democracy in Russia, just as much as the citizens of Russia want this themselves. That is our desire and our vision. Russia needs to realise that democracy will be good for Russia too.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we hope that further progress will be made at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod with regard to a new and comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Both the EU and Russia must keep in mind that a true partnership can only be a straightforward relationship. On behalf of the ALDE Group, I would like to invite the representatives of the EU to address all the concerns raised by the European Parliament with their Russian counterparts.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union will face major difficulties in relations with Russia unless the two partners rely on the same values and principles. If the Kremlin moves even further away from democracy and the rule of law, Russia will lose all legitimacy as a partner to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, the Kremlin has prevented a number of political parties from registering for the State Duma elections on procedural grounds, and the list is likely to be extended to include the People’s Freedom Party led by Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Milov, Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Ryzhkov. The surging suppression of the opposition must be brought up at the summit and the opposition parties must be allowed to register.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is not China. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE; therefore, she must uphold her international commitments and obligations. Furthermore, Russia must abide by her own constitution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Russia has to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours. We insist that she stops pressuring Ukraine – as my colleague said just now – for example, as Prime Minister Putin did yesterday when he met the Prime Minister of Ukraine, pressing them to join the customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. We cannot accept this. We expect Russia to withdraw its troops immediately from Georgia to the pre-conflict positions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, the ALDE Group is very disappointed that, on the eve of the summit, Russia has imposed a disproportional import ban on vegetables from the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Russia is an important partner for the EU in many respects. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia exercises a potentially decisive influence on international affairs, from our relations with North Korea to its involvement in the UN quartet. I also welcome recent calls by President Medvedev for the Libyan tyrant, Muammar Gaddafi, to leave power. I also hope that the Kremlin will align itself with the rest of the international community on stopping Iranian nuclear proliferation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also accept that Russia has economic interests in the former Soviet republics, some of which are now – thankfully – gravitating away from Moscow towards the EU. However, the EU should continue to insist that it will support and engage with these now-independent countries such as Ukraine, and make sure that the door is left open to them in terms of Euro-Atlantic aspirations. In this regard, I hope that the Vice-President/High Representative will raise the issue of Georgia, parts of whose territory remain annexed and occupied illegally by Russian soldiers, and help also to put pressure on Russia to solve the Transnistria question in Moldova. I also accept that the Commission is now making the suggestion that the EU-Russia Summit should be annual rather than every six months, which is a good idea and the way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia is not a mature liberal democracy. Neither is it a country which enjoys an independent judiciary. But whether we like it or not, we still have to engage with the bear.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Füle, while, at first glance, it may seem understandable for Russia to protect itself in order to prevent the spread of Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection into its territory, a complete ban on imports of European vegetables is not what we expect of a country that aspires to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO). That is also something we will have to talk about in Nizhny Novgorod. More important, however, are the political germs, or seeds, that are actually present – the weak beginnings of democracy and the rule of law. On these aspects, we should do everything we can within the context of the Partnership for Modernisation to help their roots to spread across Russia and develop.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Medvedev has acknowledged that economical and technical modernisation cannot be achieved without a fundamental modernisation of society. Yet so far, we have seen little in the way of action to accompany these fine words. The representatives of the EU should therefore make it abundantly clear to President Medvedev that the forthcoming elections to the Duma are a test of the credibility of his reform policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Genuine and proper elections form part of the foundations of democracy. Anyone who wants pluralism and political competition should ensure that the election standards declared by the Council of Europe are adhered to and should allow long-term election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the earliest stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fair elections start with allowing the registration of parties. Regrettably, early indications suggest that the Russian leadership has learnt nothing from the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that there were no grounds for dissolving the Republican Party and apparently does not wish to allow the newly established People’s Freedom Party to be registered.</p>
      <p sl="de">More Kremlin-backed parties and an All-Russia People’s Front initiated by Prime Minister Putin are merely leading us down a political blind alley. This semblance of competition has led the country into political apathy and devalued the Duma. President Medvedev could bring about a breakthrough here and end his Presidency with at least one demonstrable success.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the particular cases of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Magnitsky, rather than waiting for a ruling from Strasbourg, the judicial arbitrariness should be brought to an end. The review of these cases by the Fedotov commission is a good first step. Its results and conclusions should be published as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The future participation of the Civil Society Forum established recently in Prague should be an important topic for discussion during the talks and negotiations between the EU and Russia. After all, events in North Africa demonstrate that for effective reform, you need an active civil society. The Russian Government should therefore work to bring this about in its own country and endeavour to achieve a partnership for modernisation with civil society.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, I have been searching in vain for an answer to the question of why we are debating a resolution on the summit with Russia on the eve of the summit itself and voting on it on the day the summit takes place in Nizhny Novgorod. Moreover, the topic was not even included on the agenda of the plenary at the beginning of last week. This all smacks of bad planning, and it is now a formality, in my opinion. Moreover, instead of striving, through a principled process, for a new agreement on relations with Russia, which we recognise as an important partner, we are notoriously repeating proclamations and demands which clearly have no hope of succeeding.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We should, first and foremost, build on the issues where progress can be achieved. An example is the progress over agreements on the planned easing and possible final removal of the mutual visa arrangements with Russia. Instead of this, we are criticising the position of Russia in the case of imports of vegetables from the EU. How does our own behaviour appear, however, from outside the Union? When looking for the source of the deadly bacteria, and in the absence of hard evidence, we accuse each other, restrict imports and exports of commodities and claim compensation. We can surely draw our own conclusions as to the level of confidence we are inspiring, and not just in Russia.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas, from the economy to human rights, because there are no alternatives to dialogue. Europe and Russia are, in fact, interdependent, both economically and politically.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am thinking of unresolved international issues such as energy security, the Maghreb, Iran’s nuclear capability, terrorism, the Caucasus, Nagorno-Karabakh, climate change and others. Russia is a strategic partner for Europe, not least because of the synergies that may be built in future. As already happens to some extent, Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources, scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Russia’s future is linked to Europe’s and must be developed with perseverance, without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist. In that respect, the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, in connection with the upcoming summit, I would like to draw the negotiating delegation’s attention to two things. Firstly, I would like to encourage them to reconsider the importance of Russian energy imports and, secondly, to extend the Partnership Agreement in a way that EU representatives could participate as observers in the elections to be held in December this year and in the Presidential elections to be held in March 2013. As we can see, energy imports from Russia are likely to increase, bearing in mind that many European nuclear power plants will be closed down after carrying out the stress tests.</p>
      <p sl="hu">So we are, once again, beginning to be concerned that we will again be more dependent on Russia in the future. However, I would like to remind you that the coin has another side. Russia is just as dependent on the European Union, because they sell most of their products to us. If we do not buy their energy products, then the Russian economy will encounter serious stability problems in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Russia and the European Union are partners because of their mutual interests and because of their geographical location. This is the case whether we like it or not. We must make this partnership a positive and constructive one. That is why we need to make progress on the Partnership Agreement and on visa facilitation, to add substance to the Partnership for Modernisation, in order to work towards this.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to realise, however, that this gives rise to obligations on both sides, including in respect of membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in that you cannot just continue doing as you like; rather, these agreed contractual or international rules are binding on everyone and there is no place for arbitrariness in reciprocal dealings. This also precludes using energy as a political weapon, for example.</p>
      <p sl="de">These mutual interests must be handled positively and constructively, and where external policy is concerned, this naturally also means that Russia must take on some responsibility. At the moment, there is the case of Syria in the United Nations Security Council. In such cases, Russia must make a constructive contribution to the creation of a peaceful international community. This also means, however, accepting the sovereign rights of neighbouring states and their decisions as regards entering into the alliances that they wish to enter into. Moreover, Russia must make a positive contribution in the case of ‘frozen conflicts’ and must now bring to an end the unlawful circumstances in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a shared responsibility in the global world. It is clear that Russia and the European Union have substantial mutual interests in this global order, and in defining these interests, we must ensure that Russia recognises that democracy and the rule of law are also crucial for internal development. A degree of conditionality is called for not just in relations with us alone; a country in which there is no rule of law is also not a good place to invest, because there is no legal certainty. A country without democracy and the rule of law cannot really make progress in the long term for the benefit of its own citizens. Let us hope that the Partnership for Modernisation and other matters will help us to find a common and positive way forward here.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to mention two points because Mr Swoboda has already mentioned a number of points on behalf of our group. Russia is indeed at an important crossroads. Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012.</p>
      <p sl="de">One can also put a positive slant on this. There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia’s development. This is conditional upon there being fair elections, fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates, to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia. This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation. We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation – not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy, but also in its society. Governments put things down on paper and, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper. Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented.</p>
      <p sl="de">Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity. We can only successfully support such modernisation, however, if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences. For these reasons, the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented, in order to achieve results as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation. A month ago, this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes. We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here. These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling, but they are no substitute for an overall solution. I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace. You can count on our support in any case, including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994. We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then. We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia. Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria. At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran’s nuclear programme is pleasing.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation. Yet what is modernity without democracy? In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner Füle, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes. Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia’s democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections – there must be progress there.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level. Two summits a year is too much. Let us have one summit, as we do with America. We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas. Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in my opinion, the most significant aspects of relations with Russia are energy policy and human rights. Russia is pursuing a strategic goal of bringing individual countries under its control by exploiting the issue of gas when conducting foreign policy. Just in the last few days, the Russian authorities have used blackmail to put pressure on Ukraine, making changes in gas prices dependent on the country joining the Russian customs union or a merger between Gazprom and Naftogaz. The above actions quite obviously put an end to discussions on the creation of an EU-Ukraine free trade area. Long-term agreements on gas supplies are also a way of influencing the policies of EU Member States. We should therefore commend the position of the European Commission, which has acknowledged that the agreement concluded by the Polish Government does not comply with EU law. Prices for Russian gas in Central Europe are already almost twice as high as those offered to Western European countries. Russia’s discrediting of shale gas extraction projects is causing additional alarm.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The human rights problem is most apparent in the Khodorkovsky case. There can be no question that this issue must be raised during the summit, in view of the ruling handed down by the European Court of Human Rights on the unlawfulness of the arrest and detention of the Russian businessman.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to remind Commissioner Füle of his very well-appreciated communication on the European Neighbourhood Policy; and I can hear, Commissioner, that you basically concede that we should apply the same principle to Russia as well, even if Russia is not a part of the Eastern Neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we should indeed call for what you have termed deep democracy, and we have to work seriously to support civil society in Russia. I would like to highlight some points in the joint resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow. We underline the need to maintain close contacts and support programmes for the development of civil society in Russia. I would like to inform you, Commissioner, that today there is very worrying news from Nizhny Novgorod, where the summit will be just starting.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been informed by civil society organisations there that pre-emptive measures have been taken by the law enforcement agencies. Attempts have been made to question people who could communicate with the EU representatives, and this is completely unacceptable. Even people who work on children’s rights have been warned not to go to Nizhny Novgorod. The credit cards of the main local organiser of the civil society event – which is, by the way, the first ever linked to an EU-Russia Summit – have been blocked (for technical reasons, of course), and her car licence plates have mysteriously disappeared.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I ask that you make sure that the EU representatives at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod will give recognition and support to the civil society organisations.

      <p sl="el">Russia is the EU’s third biggest trading partner. EU exports to Russia total EUR 65.6 billion.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, we are aware that Russia is of significance to the EU, not just where economic matters are concerned, but also as a strategic partner. The ban on imports of EU vegetables that has been imposed by Moscow is undoubtedly problematic in the run-up to the negotiations on Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and we should make sure that Russia does not come into conflict with the WTO rules in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are also problems, however, in the area of the still unimplemented agreement from 2006 in respect of EU airlines. Relations between the EU and Russia are further strained by the planned US missile defences in Romania. If the EU is serious about its strategies for improving relations with Russia, then it must firstly resolve these problems and secondly, give consideration to Russian sensitivities relating to an historical sphere of influence that undoubtedly exists, or which exists as far as Russia is concerned. That is the only way we will make any progress.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the partnership between the European Union and Russia entails responsibility, including towards third countries. I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the paragraph of the resolution which calls on Russia not to use the supply of energy resources as a tool for influencing its neighbours’ policies. This is what has happened in the case of Ukraine, where Mr Putin, the Russian Prime Minister, said quite openly during his last meeting with Mr Azarov, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, that lower prices would only be offered and the gas contract renegotiated if Ukraine entered into a customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which would mean abandoning its European plans and aspirations. This is nothing short of blackmail. If the contract is not renegotiated, gas prices on the Russia-Ukraine border may reach EUR 500 per 1 000 m3 . Ukraine is already paying the highest prices in Europe for Russian gas, although it is closest to the sources of this gas.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This situation may result in a very serious economic and social crisis in Ukraine. I would like to make it clear that the European Union has obligations towards Ukraine, given that we are currently successfully negotiating the country’s entry into a free trade area or the creation of such an area, and will, in the near future, engage in relations with it as an ally of the European Union. I would call on the Commission to demand quite plainly that Russia ceases all such practices and puts a stop to them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, yet another EU-Russia Summit is taking place this week. Major changes have occurred in the world since the last one. Let me mention among them, firstly, the Arab revolutions, a process of deep transformation which affects virtually the whole Arab world. The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant reshaped the future of nuclear power, especially with regard to safety. Climate change has brought more and more dangerous consequences. Osama is dead but terrorism is alive and has targeted innocent people all over the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The list of events is long and all of them concern both the EU and Russia, two neighbouring global players with predominantly similar or complementary long-term interests. Their relations can only be further developed if they are based on mutual respect, openness and transparency. Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort, if not destroy, these relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and Parliament have always been clear about the expectations of European citizens. Now, with regard to the upcoming summit, I would like to highlight four issues. First of all, the summit should bring decisive progress on all the remaining obstacles related to Russia’s accession to the WTO. This important step will create better opportunities for the business communities on both sides and will further liberalise trade and economic relations globally. In this respect, the application of protectionist measures is counterproductive and we hope they will not be hidden behind overplayed health threats, which is, in our opinion, the recent case with the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">We hope that the road map for visa-free travelling announced in May will accelerate further visa facilitation and will bring closer the moment when the visa regime between the EU and Russia will be fully liberalised. To this end, Parliament expects that some politically sensitive issues will be properly addressed by the Russian authorities, in particular, by stopping the issuing of Russian passports to the residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to see a more constructive engagement of Russia in our efforts to support democratisation, economic and social progress and stability in the six countries in the Eastern Partnership. The last two years have clearly shown that this EU initiative is not aimed at competition, but rather at cooperation with Russia, since the stable and self-confident common neighbourhood is in the interests of both the EU and Russia. In this respect, we urge Russia to intensify its efforts in facilitating the peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Transnistria and in the more and more worrying Nagorno-Karabakh region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to mention that the EU and Russia should fully cooperate in the revision and elaboration of higher standards for nuclear power safety, following the events in Japan. We expect that higher standards are kept, not only in the newly built, but also in the already operational, nuclear power plants. I hope that this issue can be part of the discussions in Nizhny Novgorod.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Canada’s Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, likened sharing a border with the USA to sharing a bed with an elephant. Our Union must share its bed with a bear.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must continue to try to develop relations in the context of the four common spaces and on the basis of last year’s Partnership for Modernisation. As the Commissioner said, the last two years have seen improvements. The agreement on a gas advisory forum and the improved early warning mechanism are among these. Progress this month in solving the Transnistria conflict would be another positive step.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as Baroness Ashton said last month after the Khodorkovsky/Lebedev judgment, and as the European Court on Human Rights has concluded on many occasions, real progress requires respect for democracy and human rights and a stable and fair legal framework for business, which are too often absent in Russia. A structured civil society dialogue would help; common action to fight climate change would help to build trust. But the Russian bear still has a sore head and I advise the Commission to carry to Nizhny Novgorod not only a jar of honey but also a large net.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Commissioner, as you are surely aware, Russia is a self-confident state and the Russians are a self-confident nation. The relationship between the EU and Russia must take the form of a genuine partnership, and not just a feigned partnership. Since we have excellent relations with the countries of the Eastern Partnership, relations between the EU and Russia must be at least on the same level. I am therefore delighted that, in your speech, you did not forget to mention the importance of abolishing the visa requirement with Russia, as relations between partners must be built on trust and openness. We should tell Russia clearly and seriously what the timetable is for abolishing visas, and what conditions must therefore be fulfilled.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first of all, a very urgent issue. I trust that this EU-Russia Summit will firmly address the very harmful and utterly disproportionate import ban on our European vegetables. The market gardening sector expects this ban to be lifted and deserves to see that happen. Commissioner Füle, can you confirm that the EU delegation will fully commit itself to resolving this situation in Nizhny Novgorod? This is a very important question and one that I get asked a lot in my country at the moment when I talk about the EU-Russia Summit.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I wanted to say a few words, in particular, about the problematic accession of Russia to the WTO. Just one more brief question. Georgia has, in fact, played a key role here. Georgia has de facto the right of veto. President Saakashvili is raising the stakes. What he wants are transparent borders – he basically wants Abkhazia and South Ossetia back – and he has, of course, also put the import ban on Georgian wines and mineral water on the agenda. However, Russia does not seem to be budging at all. In brief, is it not the case that we have deadlock on our hands here? It very much looks like it. Besides, the Russian economy, which is mainly driven by oil and gas, does not really need accession to the WTO.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, I call on the heads of the EU institutions not to forget human rights at the EU-Russia Summit that begins tomorrow. It is clear that respect for human rights is a valuable basis, without which a strategic partnership and the modernisation of EU-Russian relations would be impossible.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The specific case we need to discuss is the ruling by Moscow city court on 24 May to reject the appeal made by Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev against the new seven year sentence. In the 21st century, a shameful trial is taking place before our very eyes, and the sentences are not written in court. This is happening in a country linked to the EU by a so-called strategic partnership. The ruling by the Moscow court once again revealed serious flaws in Russia’s court system and strengthened the opinion that it punishes those in Russia who have political ambitions, but whose opinions do not coincide with those of the Kremlin.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The ruling made on 31 May by the European Court of Human Rights and violations in Russia of the European Convention on Human Rights are facts that must also be discussed.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We, the European Parliament should say clearly that, if Russia’s President, Dmitri Medvedev, wants to come to the European Parliament, he should appear here together with prisoner of conscience, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and this would be the most effective strategy and tactic for the modernisation of Russia. President Medvedev and prisoner of conscience, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, together in the European Parliament – that would be a sight worth not only the attention of the world’s media, but also the heartfelt support of democratic society.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, this summit is special because it takes place against the backdrop of the forthcoming elections in Russia. We expect Brussels to send Russia a strong signal about the elections respecting democratic standards, which would safeguard diversity of opinion in the Duma. The question of nuclear safety is particularly relevant following Fukushima. I am pleased that the Member of the Commission mentioned that this issue will be raised at the summit and that there will be a call for the highest international safety standards in nuclear power plants already operating and those that are planned, in both Russia, and of course, the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I feel that EU and Russian relations with Belarus should also be discussed. A convergence of positions would help to open the prison gates for those who recently stood in the Belarusian elections and would stop blatant human rights abuses. I very much support those fellow Members who said that we need to translate words into deeds in the area of visa facilitation, and not just with Russia, but all of the European Union’s eastern neighbours.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Our most serious failings in relations between the EU and Russia are inconsistency, weakness and a lack of awareness of our own power. The Nord Stream issue is typical in this respect. First, we make energy solidarity one of Europe’s leading principles in the Treaty of Lisbon, and then the EU agrees to the Nord Stream project, which is harmful to Poland and the other new Member States in geopolitical terms. We should therefore stand our ground when discussing each of the issues on the forthcoming agenda as outlined by the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Russia must observe certain rules as regards the WTO. They should first allow Georgian wine onto their market before dreaming of WTO membership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As far as visas are concerned, Russia must be told that the visa regime will be liberalised for countries participating in the Eastern Partnership first, and for Russia only afterwards. The Kaliningrad Oblast may represent an exception to this rule.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As regards the energy sector, Russia must be told that we are opposed to the repeated blackmailing of Ukraine, and that we are opposed to the measures taken by Russian agencies of influence, attempting to belittle the extraction of shale gas in Poland and in Europe. This is a great opportunity to gain independence from Russia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Russia has proclaimed a modernisation programme and some observers are speaking about a new perestroika. So far, unfortunately, there is no real progress. Analysts conclude that the priority of the current Russian élites is to keep the present system in place, trying not to allow external relations to have any impact on the domestic situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore up to the EU to make one issue very clear. The success of the Partnership for Modernisation will be dependent on the Russian Government’s willingness and capacity to provide for a truly independent judiciary and to implement the basic principles of the rule of law, transparency and reciprocity. If the EU will not address this crucial issue in a principled manner, hardly any progress can be expected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s International Herald Tribune writes: ‘Russia can’t have a modern economy until it has a genuine rule of law’. The summit venue will be Nizhny Novgorod, in Soviet times, Gorky, where the key figure of Soviet conscience, Andrei Sakharov, was banished for many years. I call upon the Commission and our negotiators to follow the spirit of Andrei Sakharov and to remember the message of Sakharov Prize winner, Sergei Kovalev, in this hemicycle two years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the EU should stimulate and help Russia to come to terms with its totalitarian legacy. After 20 years, even Mr Medvedev had to admit that one cannot ignore the terrible and criminal heritage of Russian power. I recall the words of our colleague, Mr Swoboda, who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history, especially the atrocities of the Stalin era. We can help Russia come to terms with its past.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Russia still requires a two-handed approach: on the one hand, firm demands for the fulfilment of democratic principles, but, at the same time, a rejection of Bush’s well-honed anti-Russian policy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Russia certainly has no right to a sphere of influence. All former Soviet republics have the right to decide freely where they wish to belong. It surely has the right, however, to safety and international security. Such a sense of security would certainly liberalise the internal situation in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is necessary to draw Russia into global politics on the side of Europe, so that Russia can feel that it is an accepted partner in the creation of an international and democratic order. The Partnership for Modernisation must fulfil not only the state-monopoly ideas of the Russian Government, but should create an area for untrammelled industrial and scientific activity, as Mr Fleckenstein said in his analysis here.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If we adopted a different approach to Russia along these lines, we might harbour the hidden hope that democratic processes would be liberated to a far greater extent in Russia, with a certainty and confidence that can then feed into European politics. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will emerge from the forthcoming talks.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, on the eve of the EU-Russia Summit, and in the context of negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, it is important for the EU not only to speak with one voice, but to show Russia its unity and solidarity in practice. Energy solidarity is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, but Russia does not accept this principle, with the Nord Stream project being an obvious example of this attitude. We must not agree to attempts to isolate some of the EU’s new Member States using the dividing wedge of the energy sector, and this should be clearly emphasised during the summit. We should also expect acknowledgement of the European ambitions of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, and that Russia will be called upon to stop putting political pressure on these countries. Furthermore, we should remember that Russia is a unique democracy with a very high rate of corruption.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, the new European Union-Russia partnership agreement must be concrete and legally binding in all areas of cooperation. This is a justified demand because we cannot allow for the agreement to be a collection of general phrases. The European Union and Russia are mutually dependent. The European market is no less important to Russia than Russian gas is to us, and Russian economic modernisation plans are directly dependent on our technology and expertise. That is why our cooperation should be closely linked to improvements in the fields of human rights and the rule of law. The European Union is Russia’s largest trading partner and main investor; that is why the new agreement must contain legally binding terms regarding investment. It is important to insist on the elimination of unilateral and unreasonable trade barriers. This relates to the Russia – Kazakhstan – Belarus customs union, as well as to the current embargo on European Union vegetables. Russia cannot be allowed to continue using energy policy to implement its geopolitical interests, by discriminating against certain Member States, for example in the field of gas tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Commissioner, in continuing to work on the visa-free zone with Russia, we must also work on establishing a visa-free zone with the rest of our Eastern Partnership states. At the summit, we must reiterate that the six-point agreement on Georgia has still not been implemented. Taking into account the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, the restrictions placed on opposition members regarding registration for the elections and on appearing in the mass media must be removed. We have already affirmed our willingness to be present in all phases of the election process, yet Russia must show willingness to accept long-term observers, as well as to actually implement fair elections. In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that these critical remarks are not in any way directed against Russia or its people, but the opposite – they are directed against the current government, in order to improve the situation in Russia and make our cooperation more fruitful.</p>

I would merely like to remind you that modernising Russia is not merely a matter of economic or energy issues, but also a matter of political modernisation and relations between the authorities and society. I would ask you to raise this issue. This also involves relations between Russia and its neighbours, and Russia’s ‘sphere of influence’. Since you are conducting relations with Ukraine so very successfully, I would urge you to make it very clear that an association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine will also be beneficial to Russia, and that we are very alarmed at the manifestations of extremely forceful political pressure being brought to bear on Ukraine on the eve of the conclusion of negotiations, while these negotiations are in their final stages.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, may I say that I was astonished to hear a man such as Mr Mölzer, who is well educated in history, say that there are historical zones of Russian influence in Europe and that this includes parts of the European Union such as Romania. The days of the Hitler-Stalin pact are long gone and in a democratic world, we should be practising a kind of European Monroe Doctrine; in other words, that the fate and the policies of Europe are decided by Europeans. That does not mean that we do not want a policy of good neighbourliness and dialogue. Yet Nizhny Novgorod – the venue for our meeting – should also serve as a warning, because it reminds us of the famous story of the merchants of Nizhny Novgorod who believed that they could buy their freedom and their security and were then hanged.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to realise that we cannot buy security with money or by glossing over reality; it is only obtainable through honest partnership. We need a common foreign affairs and security policy. We need energy independence and energy security and less dependence on Russian energy policy, which is still being used for foreign policy purposes. We also need to speak clearly on human rights. We cannot afford to compromise here. Where Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are concerned, I would state that these individuals must at last be freed – otherwise the state visit by the Russian President to the European Parliament will take place under a huge cloud.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to have a partnership with a Russia that is in the process of democratising, but to do that, Russia must democratise – in reality and not just in our wishful thinking. That is why I think Mr Swoboda is right: the forthcoming elections will be decisive. Then we will see whether our partnership with the Russian people – of whom we are very fond – can be expanded into a genuine partnership with the Russian state.</p>

We should make the strategic partnership closer, deeper and broader. The basis for all EU-Russia relations in future, however, needs to be the promotion of peace and security and support for democratic values and political and economic freedom.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Partnership for Modernisation should be deepened and made more focused, but mere political dialogue between diplomats is simply not enough.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, there will no doubt be a great many issues covered during the EU-Russia Summit, but one of the most important is anticipated to be the issue of energy security. For several months, Russia has been conducting a very intensive campaign aimed at obtaining exemptions for its gas infrastructure from the rules set out in the third energy package, or, in other words, the rules of our anti-monopoly law, which prohibit the simultaneous and parallel control of energy resources and transmission networks. Mr Shmatko, the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Kramer, CEO of the South Stream project, and Mr Miller, CEO of Gazprom, have made visits to Brussels in connection with this matter. This is a major campaign. The European Union’s position on this matter must be set out very clearly to Russia, namely, that we do not intend to grant reduced tariffs to Russia; instead, what matters to us is that the gas market in Central Europe becomes more competitive and less monopolised. Commissioner, I would ask you to tell us plainly whether the European Commission is prepared to make statements to this effect during the summit.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in the run-up to the forthcoming summit, we really can say that the European Union lacks a single coherent strategy as regards Russia, and that the current policy of pragmatic cooperation based on a strategy of small steps may very easily fall apart during whatever crisis occurs next, as was the case in 2008 during the war with Georgia, or in 2009 after gas supplies were cut off.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the context of the latter event, it is very important to emphasise the definition of the word ‘diversification’, which in Europe is often synonymous with the construction of a large number of different gas pipelines from Russia. Diversification is taken to mean the construction of the South and Nord Stream gas pipelines, for example. Meanwhile, the European Union should concentrate on guaranteeing gas supplies from non-Russian sources: it should do more to promote the Nabucco pipeline from Azerbaijan, and it should invest in gas terminals and research into extracting shale gas.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also very important that pressure continues to be put upon the Russian authorities at various levels to improve the human rights situation in Russia. Apart from discussion in the framework of the EU-Russia summits, we should ensure that the consultations which take place twice yearly with European Union representatives and diplomats from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are decisively stepped up.</p>

Russia is potentially a very important partner for the European Union, for example, when it comes to finding a solution to certain frozen conflicts in Europe which remain unresolved. I believe that the Russian authorities should be told that although vegetables and gas are important, they must stop supporting Transnistrian separatists, that we expect them to stop supplying weapons to Azerbaijan and Armenia, since this poses a great risk for the future of this region, and that we also expect Russia to fulfil its obligations under the agreement on Georgia concluded in 2008.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, although I agree with Mr Lisek’s statements on Georgia, and not forgetting what many MEPs have said about Ukraine, it seems to me that at tomorrow’s summit, we must also spare a few words – or a great many words – for Belarus. I would ask everyone to remember that we have been dealing for many months with a very far-reaching political crisis there, and that for at least several months, we have been dealing with a far-reaching economic crisis. We are also dealing with a situation in which Russia is putting pressure on Belarus, probably a great deal more forcefully and effectively than it currently is on Ukraine. Russia is effectively attempting to take over the entire economy, or rather strategic sectors of the economy, by taking advantage of the dramatic situation in which the Belarusian economy finds itself. I have one request. If Russia decides to provide aid, and we know that it has decided to provide aid to Belarus, the European Union should ensure that Russia makes this aid dependent on the observance of human rights. These are common values that we apparently share with Russia, a fact which is often repeated by the Russians, and so they should help us to introduce these values in Belarus. Otherwise, by funding the Lukashenko regime, we will be responsible for it.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, we always have a number of problematic issues on hand for negotiations with Russia, such as the standard of civil rights, the nonsensical ban on imports of vegetables from the EU, the anti-missile shield located in the EU, or the problematic involvement of Russia in many former Soviet republics.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I do not want to say that we should avoid talking about these difficult topics, but I firmly believe that we should not limit ourselves to them.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should also bring new ideas for mutually beneficial cooperation. European producers need new opportunities to sell their products. Russia is an enormous trade area, with ever increasing purchasing power. It is therefore necessary to work more intensively to eliminate the obstacles that are holding back trade cooperation, and also jointly to support projects such as the extension of the broad-gauge railway line running from the Pacific to the heart of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Projects such as this can create new impulses for cooperation, the implementation of which will bring benefits not only to Europe, but also to Ukraine, Russia and many Asian countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, talks are being held between the European Union and Russia on the future of the energy sector, but from what I understand, a new group is currently being set up, which will debate the third energy package in the context of gas security. I would like to call on Commissioner Füle, and on Commissioner Oettinger, to provide the European Parliament with information regarding the progress of the talks and the outcome of this group’s negotiations. We would also like a list of the members of the negotiating group. I learnt from a representative of a Russian energy concern that the company would be participating in these negotiations. I would like to know whether this is true, and whether the representatives of large companies will take part in negotiations on the Russian side.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Compliance with competition law in the field of energy, without the granting of any exemptions, is also a very important matter for the European Parliament. During the recent presentations of South Stream investment plans in Brussels, it was apparent that Russia and Gazprom want privileges and a special status. We cannot agree to this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I see Parliament’s resolution as Europe’s hand extended to the Russia of today which needs, despite all its baseless pride and inherited arrogance, a really friendly advice and action plan. As the Human Rights Consultations advising President Medvedev have called for an essential renovation of the national house from basement to roof, our Parliament is coming not with empty appeasement but with constructive provision of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The greatest chance appears there if Russia is open and striving to build an open society, not one that is closed in backward Stalinism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, Russia’s pressure on the rest of the G8 to accept the occupied territories of Georgia in the WTO system on the side of Russia does not testify to their really good will.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Russia is no doubt an important partner for the European Union, but a very difficult one. Accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is undoubtedly of great importance to Russia.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the EU-Russia Summit is taking place against the background of regional developments which influence this partnership. Reform of the European Neighbourhood Policy may help resolve the conflict in Transnistria. Indeed, Russia has shown an interest in setting up a joint political committee. However, the structure and deadline for setting up this body are due to be discussed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The food crisis which is affecting Europe at the moment has brought trade with Russia to a halt. New negotiations on current sanitary regulations could improve this situation. Russia’s membership of the WTO will have a long-term impact on economic relations with the EU. This is why all the relevant agreements need to be revised.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is good that the European Union should strive to have the best possible relations with all its neighbours, and indeed with all countries around the world. Sometimes, that can be difficult – particularly, I suppose, when it comes to Russia, because it has a very chequered history. Even since the fall of the Iron Curtain over 20 years ago, its behaviour towards some countries, particularly neighbours such as Georgia, certainly cannot be admired.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously, any negotiations with Russia have to be underpinned by a recognition of the important values of respect for human rights and respect for neighbours. Nevertheless, they do offer a great opportunity for tackling global issues like climate change and also, of course, a great opportunity to develop both our economies. Russia is a rising country and a developing country in terms of wealth. Certainly, if the fundamentals are right, there are great opportunities both for the European Union and for Russia in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today’s exchange of views was indeed very useful for adding a final touch to our summit preparations and you can rest assured that I will convey the key messages to the High Representative and Vice-President Ashton who will debrief the Presidents and Commissioner Karel De Gucht.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have heard many of you calling for continuing engagement with Russia, calling for the relationship and coordination with the Russian Federation to be further developed, but I also heard calls for more democracy and less corruption. I also heard a call for no harassment, which was reported in Nizhny Novgorod, although I respect the role of the Russian Federation in ensuring security for the summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen that we have convergent views on many subjects. We agree on the key importance of our relations with Russia both bilaterally and in multilateral contexts, whether regional or global. We agree that it is a multifaceted relationship in which economic, social and environmental issues, human rights and rule of law, security aspects and political cooperation are all of paramount importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not expect a resolution of all pending problems at this summit – and yes, we will raise the issue of vegetables. But we should aim to make significant progress in a number of areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me comment on some of these areas. First: elections. The Russian authorities are well aware that the European Union will be following the 2011 and 2012 electoral processes very closely. Should there be irregularities in the upcoming elections, these issues would have to be addressed. Right now, we are calling on Russia to respect obligations it has undertaken in the context of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the OSCE regarding free and fair elections, and to cooperate well with ODIHR to ensure appropriate monitoring. We will place a special emphasis on the issue of the registration of new parties and access to the electoral process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second: I took note of Parliament’s concerns with regard to the human rights situation in Russia; we share most of them and these issues will be raised with the Russian President at the summit. The main forum for addressing human rights and rule-of-law issues is the European Union-Russia human rights consultations. This is an important instrument and its potential should be fully used. Unfortunately, this is not yet the case and the European Union will therefore stress the need to have an honest and useful dialogue for which a review of the consultations’ modalities is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third: the Partnership for Modernisation. I fully agree with the honourable Members that the Partnership for Modernisation should be broadly based. The coordinators will present in Nizhny Novgorod the second programme report on the implementation of the partnership and, as you will see, the rule of law is at the very core of this initiative and we have concrete projects in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Point four: Russia is the neighbour of our neighbours, and I think Nizhny Novgorod would be an excellent opportunity to refer to the recently adopted ENP review document and, with reference to this document, to make sure that we are transparent in our policy vis-à-vis the neighbours we share with Russia. This is an opportunity – based inter alia on that transparency – to make our point that caring about the well-being of the neighbours we share is a win-win process. I think it will also be a good opportunity, based on some new ideas in that ENP review, to talk about a strengthened cooperation to address the protracted conflicts in our neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">Point five: the question of energy cooperation will be addressed at the summit. We need transparent, fair and competitive energy relations and we will raise our concerns with the Russian President. We will emphasise the need for further reforms, as I stressed in my opening remarks, in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, the European Union and Russia are partners. Partners should talk to each other frequently, they should try to achieve consensus where possible, but should not hesitate to openly address more problematic aspects. We have talked about some of these problematic aspects today. They should be addressed at the summit and, wherever possible, we should look for solutions or at least improvement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have already mentioned the ENP review. I strongly believe that one of the added values of that reviewed Neighbourhood Policy is that the universally applicable values and principles reflected there are not only applicable to small and medium-sized neighbouring countries.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I am pleased to be one of those signing this resolution, which reaffirms the importance of respect for democracy and human rights in relations between the European Union and Russia. Starting with the Russia-EU dialogue on human rights and continuing with the summits, I think that a systematic and honest approach is required in cases where the standards for a fair trial are not respected or human rights activists or journalists are persecuted and prevented from doing their job.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, clear reference criteria need to be introduced regarding Russia’s respect for democratic standards, which will help deepen relations with the EU. Lastly, we must not forget either the support which needs to be given in developing civil society, as the guarantor of a democracy which will not only stick to procedures but be truly inclusive as well.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the delegation for relations with Central Asia and Mongolia, which I am honoured to chair, went to Mongolia just three weeks ago on the occasion of the eighth interparliamentary meeting of the European Parliament and Mongolia. It was a very useful and interesting experience. Mongolia is a country that deserves to be better known and there are not many opportunities in this Parliament to give it the attention that it should certainly receive.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a country characterised by a multi-party parliamentary system, separation of powers, comparatively free public opinion and a level of human rights protection that stands out compared with the situation in many other countries in the region. It is also a country with development problems that is grappling with a difficult environmental situation and ongoing desertification. It has also been hit by extreme weather conditions recently. At the same time, it is very rich in natural resources – copper, gold, uranium and rare earths – which could attract a considerable influx of capital in the not-too-distant future.</p>
      <p sl="it">For all the above reasons, I think it is important to send out a signal of support for Mongolia at this crucial stage in its development, and to foster the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law as well as parliamentary control, so that the financial resources that become available to Mongolia can be used in future for the benefit of the people.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to encourage Mongolia in its desire to develop closer relations with the European Union and urge it to adopt our standards and industrial regulations. We should help it move towards a market economy and more intense economic and trade relations, which are made possible by a climate of legal certainty and the development of the rule of law. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that the European Union and Mongolia are concluding will play a decisive role in this context.</p>
      <p sl="it">For all these reasons, 45 other Members and I have tabled this oral question. In this question, we ask the Commission to provide further details on the main characteristics of the agreement and the foreseeable schedule for its ratification. I would like to point out that the agreement has already been initialled, but there is currently deadlock over its signature, apparently because of doubts raised by a Member State on the legal basis used for some of the clauses.</p>
      <p sl="it">Additionally, we would like to ask the Commission about the possibility of opening a European Union delegation in Ulaanbaatar in the near future. Such an initiative could, in fact, significantly contribute to a further deepening of our political and economic cooperation with that country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am delighted to address the House on EU-Mongolia relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very timely to discuss Mongolia. As the nineteenth largest country in the world, Mongolia occupies the strategic crossroads between the fast-growing markets of both China and Russia. It is a youthful and vibrant nation with a long, proud tradition and history. Mongolia is making good progress on its chosen path to democracy. I would like to congratulate Mongolia on its peaceful elections, its vibrant civil society and free media. These are indeed milestones on Mongolia’s journey towards political pluralism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union particularly welcomes the moratorium on the death penalty announced by the President of Mongolia, which faced domestic opposition from certain quarters.</p>
      <p sl="en">As requested by Mongolia, the European Union is ready to share its experience, especially as regards taking up and bringing forward European principles, norms and standards. I am therefore pleased to confirm the inclusion of Mongolia as a pilot country as regards European Union support for democracy. This means we will provide it with more financial and technical assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mongolia on this year’s 100th anniversary of the democratic movement in Mongolia and on its Presidency of the Community of Democracies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the prospects for Mongolian economic development. Mongolia is at an economic crossroads as it shifts gear from a largely pastoral and nomadic society to a mineral-based economy. Huge mineral reserves are literally a ‘golden opportunity’ for Mongolia to bring more prosperity and well-being to its people. We hope that these untapped mineral resources will prove a blessing rather than a curse, as has been the case for some countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the realm of international relations, we appreciate the participation of Mongolian troops in the United Nations peace-keeping missions around the world. Mongolian troops serve in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Western Sahara and Chad. I would like to underline that Mongolia’s efforts to help stabilise Afghanistan are much valued.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the governance of Mongolia’s relations with the European Union, I am especially pleased that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which replaces the 1993 Trade and Cooperation Agreement, was negotiated within a year and initialled on 20 December 2010 in Ulaanbaatar. This agreement opens a strategic chapter in our relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">High Representative and Vice-President Baroness Ashton welcomed the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement as another ‘stepping stone towards enhanced political and economic involvement’ of the European Union and its Member States with Mongolia.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, we will work together as equal partners to cooperate in a wide range of areas: from political matters such as countering terrorism and promoting human rights, to trade and investment in key areas such as raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once the text has been approved by Member States, we hope to welcome the Prime Minister of Mongolia to Brussels to sign the agreement with Baroness Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given this further deepening of our political and economic cooperation, and the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the opening of a European Union Delegation in Ulaanbaatar is an option. The External Action Service is currently examining the European Union representations around the world. I hope that it will be possible to overcome financial and personnel obstacles in order to open a fully fledged European Union Delegation in Ulaanbaatar.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to hearing your contributions and comments.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, relations between the EU and Mongolia have developed positively over the last two decades, particularly in relation to Mongolia’s gradual democratisation and modernisation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Closer cooperation with the EU, however, depends on building confidence in the Mongolian political regime’s long-term stability by strengthening human rights guarantees and the attributes of the rule of law, which assumes, of course, the proper functioning of the judicial system and the elimination of corruption in the public sphere.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The movement towards a genuine market economy must also be accompanied by continuing restructuring, by reforms in the area of commercial law and investment law, and by the private sector taking a greater share in the economy. I consider it a positive development that the country has passed a law on the protection of competition, with the aim of preventing abuse of the dominant position of private or state-owned firms, or the creation of cartel agreements at the expense of other firms and consumers. I firmly believe that the reforms will help to attract foreign investors and will subsequently boost the prosperity of Mongolia’s inhabitants, who continue to suffer from poverty in rural areas because of their dependence on agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion, I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that I very much support – and Commissioner Füle has already indicated this, I think, in a very positive tone – the establishment of a permanent EU delegation in Mongolia because I believe in the potential for the development of political and trade relations, bearing in mind the important fact that there are vast reserves of raw materials in this country, which is strategically located between China and Russia. I therefore think that the political and trade relations of the EU and its Member States with Mongolia should continue to be developed further.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mongolia is rich in mineral resources such as copper, coal, tungsten (wolfram), tin and gold. This makes her an extremely appealing economic partner.</p>
      <p sl="de">But, while pursuing our economic interests, we should also use the opportunity to apply conditionality in order to encourage Mongolia to start with much-needed reforms. There are severe problems in Mongolia, with rampant corruption, lack of good governance and insufficient international cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, there are also some pressing issues with the management of her natural resources. At the moment, the mineral reserves of Mongolia are rigorously exploited by many foreign companies with the complicity of the Mongolian Government. This has led to a situation where the people of Mongolia are not benefiting from the country’s resources. They must work in very poor conditions, with some workers, for example, extracting gold with mercury. Mercury fumes are causing irreversible harm to the health of such workers. But that is not all. There are many children born in Mongolia with deformities and incurable diseases as a result of harmful workplace conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Mongolian economy is also facing challenges both because of export duties and import bans that Russia and China have been imposing and owing to technical shortcomings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Livestock constitutes about 80% of Mongolia's agricultural output, but meat cannot be exported as there are insufficient facilities for quality control.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we are committed to pursuing a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, then we should help Mongolia overcome the problems that the country is facing in order to develop socially, economically and ecologically sustainable relations.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I was also a member of the delegation to Ulaanbaatar three weeks ago that held its eighth meeting there, where I had the opportunity to see for myself that the political structure and society are indeed becoming more democratic in Mongolia. Significant progress has been made in terms of human rights, we attended meetings with civil organisations which confirmed that they have already been acknowledged by the Mongolian Government, and freedom of the media has now been recognised, which is to be welcomed in any case. The signature of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is of the utmost importance because it may allow the introduction of European standards in Mongolia within its framework. Furthermore, the refurbishment of the EU representation now functioning as a technical office is absolutely necessary to improve relations between the two countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr Bartolozzi for having made Mongolia the subject of a debate in the European Parliament by taking the initiative for this question. While various aspects of the former Soviet states of Central Asia have been dealt with in Parliament, Mongolia and its situation have received very little attention.</p>
      <p sl="de">Quite unjustifiably so, for as a state of the former communist bloc, Mongolia exploited its independence at a very early stage and embarked upon a path of democratising its society. Mongolia came up with a democratic constitution as far back as 1992 and since then, a number of elections have taken place, which, according to observers, have generally been held democratically and correctly – which can by no means be taken for granted in the states of this region.</p>
      <p sl="de">For some years, the Mongolian Government has been trying to fight corruption through the law and, in 2010, it passed a moratorium on the death penalty, something that even some major democratic states have not yet managed. Nonetheless, the three million people who live in this extensive country with its extreme climatic conditions are suffering the consequences of a process of transformation that is still under way. The population of the country – until now still overwhelmingly nomadic in lifestyle – is flocking to the few towns, which do not have the infrastructure to cope.</p>
      <p sl="de">The country’s mineral resources are not being exploited in an environmentally sound way. Energy problems make civil and economic life more difficult. Squeezed between its large neighbours of Russia and China, the threat is that Mongolia will become even more dependent on these states than previously. The efforts and the successes of Mongolia – and here I see the glass as being half full, not half empty – in democratising its society should be recognised, because they set an example to the rest of the region and show what can be achieved despite a difficult past.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mongolia should continue to receive our support, not just in the context of aid programmes, but by the European Union having a direct presence in the Mongolian capital through a separate delegation, as a sign that Europe is not indifferent to the fate of Mongolia; European interests should not continue to be looked after by a delegation in Beijing. I very much regret the fact that the Conference of Presidents was not prepared to emphasise this further by approving a parliamentary resolution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, in addition to the opening of a delegation in Ulaanbaatar – something that we can no longer put off, not least because pursuing relations from Beijing is very bad for symbolic reasons – and in addition to the long-awaited partnership agreement, we are all aware both of the country’s mineral wealth and of its weaknesses in terms of social justice, even though Mongolia has, in its own way, developed a form of democratic cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would especially like to ask the Commission where Mongolia should be placed from a geostrategic point of view: it is not a country covered by the Central Asia strategy. I think, however, that some of the measures in this strategy could perhaps be extended to Mongolia, in view of its cultural history, which is similar to that of the other countries. The country also currently has observer status in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Union is examining the possibility of helping it become a full member, given the ancient cultural links that exist between Europe and Mongolia.</p>

This is why the figures for trade volume have been fairly low. In terms of culture, there have been problems organising student exchanges. Extending programmes like Erasmus to this region would also improve this area of cooperation. I think that an EU delegation needs to be established to coordinate all these activities better. This will allow direct contact with the authorities to ensure effective implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Inner Mongolia is known to be rich in coal and natural gas. Although Chinese law states that the land exploitation rights belong to the indigenous Mongolians, the reality appears to be somewhat different. There has been criticism that Chinese enterprises are consuming vast amounts of groundwater in water-intensive coal mining, resulting in desertification of the steppe. There has also been criticism that grazing lands are suffering as a result of the transport of coal.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current protests by Mongolians represent a flare-up in another long smouldering ethnic conflict in China, following the Tibetan uprising in 2008 and that of the Muslim Uighurs in 2009. In view of the chronic water shortage in China and its huge demand for raw materials, it is to be expected that the Mongolian conflict will escalate further. The partnership with Mongolia that has existed for a number of years means that the EU is now also affected and must surely redouble its efforts in respect of human rights and the rights of minorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for a valuable contribution on Mongolia. This was a short but very interesting discussion on bilateral relations with this increasingly important partner for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addressing one or two questions raised during that debate, let me say that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement covers cooperation on four main issues: firstly, principal norms and standards, secondly, sustainable development, including environment and social development, thirdly, trade and investment, with a special focus on raw materials and, lastly, justice and freedom, including the issue of migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the timing, the agreed text has been presented to the European Union Member States which will have to agree to its signature. The UK House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee is currently examining the UK’s opt-in on justice and home affairs matters covered within a number of the partnership and cooperation agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not want to speak on behalf of the House of Commons, but the procedure is expected to take between six and eight weeks. Thus, it could lead us to eventual signature in September at the next EU-Mongolia Joint Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although they are separated by long distances and have experience of different political systems, the European Union and Mongolia both share traditions of tolerance, openness and equality. With the entry into force of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the European Union will be Mongolia’s so-called ‘third neighbour’, not only in words but in deeds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before concluding, let me come back to another concrete question which I ignored – I am sorry about that oversight. There will be a special meeting tomorrow in Vienna within the framework of the OSCE’s Permanent Council. The Member States will be addressed by Mongolia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I have in front of me a draft of the EU statement. I can only say today that we will welcome Mongolia’s intention to step up relations with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We will decide tomorrow whether to give any more details.</p>
      <p sl="en">By delivering on its commitments – and let me stress that – Mongolia has strong potential to be a good example in its region.</p>
