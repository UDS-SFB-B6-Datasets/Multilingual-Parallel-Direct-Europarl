      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, after a year’s work, more than 200 hearings, seven missions abroad and thousands of pages and documents examined, what I am presenting to Parliament this morning is not just the final report on the work of our committee, but a rigorous analysis of five years of excesses and abuses, often tolerated for the sake of the fight against international terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fight against terrorism is an enterprise to which we are all committed without exception, but we never agreed that the founding principles of our Treaties should be trampled underfoot for the sake of this enterprise. Thus we come to the subject of our mandate: extraordinary renditions. Did our governments know about them? Some of them certainly did. Those governments that decided to send their agents to interrogate the victims of the renditions in Guantánamo, Syria and Afghanistan – they knew. The European embassies in Sarajevo knew what would happen to the Algerians who were captured and handed over to the Americans against the orders of the local courts to set them free. The top people in SISMI, Italy’s military intelligence service, knew that the CIA was preparing a kidnapping on Italian soil.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is widespread responsibility and contributory negligence surrounding these events, and very few European countries are entirely blameless. This is demonstrated by the facts we have gathered, Mr President: not opinions or prejudices, but circumstantiated, concrete, serious, proven, verified facts. The facts also include the unanswered questions, contradictions and omissions that we have gathered. In the face of all this evidence, if people decide to look the other way, it will be because they lack the courage to stand up for what is right or they have no intellectual honesty.</p>
      <p sl="it">Almost every day, Mr Gawronski asks me whether we have found out anything new in the last few months. Yes, Mr Gawronski, a lot. We have found out that there are many more than the 21 rendition cases that we have reconstructed: they are faceless, nameless prisoners, without anybody who will complain about their fate, because they do not have a western passport in their pocket. We have found out that one man is innocent: he may have to stay in Guantánamo for almost five years, stripped of the most basic rights, just because no government is interested in getting him out. We have found out that torture is pointless in the fight against terrorism: that was explained to us by Maher Arar, the innocent victim of a rendition, who was held and tortured in Syria for 12 months.</p>
      <p sl="it">We discovered that and other things because Mura Kurnaz and Maher Arar were our witnesses: we had asked for them to be brought before our committee under escort, and we questioned them at length, as we did many others, including victims, relatives, lawyers and magistrates. We conducted 200 hearings, Mr President, a showcase of hurt and humiliated human beings. Should we now pretend nothing has happened and look the other way, as many European governments have done? Some people, of course, would have preferred us to use more accommodating, more cautious language, perhaps in the belief that the abuses, infringements and excesses are the normal price to pay in the fight against terrorism. That is a fallacy. The strength of our principles lies in the rigour with which we can apply them, starting with the report that we are debating this morning. It is Parliament’s duty, Mr President, to show that it is not caught up in the game of expediency and political affiliations. When faced with the truth, we each represent not a government or a party, but rather our own selves, our individual moral honesty, and our integrity as human beings and as MEPs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, above all I should like to thank the committee chairman, Mr Coelho, for the balanced way in which he directed our work throughout the year. I should also like to thank all the staff and assistants and the Members who have lavished particular care and passion on this work. This page in Parliament’s history that is being written today is first and foremost the outcome of this shared passion for the public good. We expect the same rigour and, if I may say so, the same consistency from the Council and the Commission. We have opened a door, and we shall not allow anyone to close it again. Above and beyond this report, we have a duty to do everything in our power to ensure that the events of the last five years can never happen again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, it was all of a year ago, in December 2005, that the European Parliament, in its resolution calling for the establishment of the temporary committee on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, reaffirmed – and I quote, ‘its determination in the fight against terrorism but stresses that this fight cannot be won by sacrificing the very principles that terrorism seeks to destroy, notably that the protection of fundamental rights must never be compromised.’ The Council shared those sentiments then, and it still does.</p>
      <p sl="de">In July last year, my predecessor Mrs Lehtomäki stood where I am standing now and, speaking on behalf of the Finnish Presidency in the debate on the interim report from the temporary committee on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, stressed that – and I quote, ‘All action taken against terrorism must be in compliance with obligations under international law, and no compromises on these, where it concerns human rights, refugee or humanitarian issues, can be accepted in the name of action against terrorism.’ There has been no change in the Council’s position on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union’s foreign ministers have expressed this principle also in dialogues with other states, whilst, in dialogue with our American friends, we have, in addition, made clear our concern about the situation in Guantanamo and urged the USA to close the prison camp there without further ado.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP and Council Secretary-General, also stated his position on this when he was interviewed by the committee, stressing that the EU had always, in its dealings with the USA, based its arguments on the importance of the values we share, which are to be upheld in the fight against terrorism. It follows that the Council has already, for some time, been doing what the report calls for in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">The work of the temporary committee on the alleged use of European states by the CIA for the purposes of transporting and illegally detaining prisoners, together with the Council of Europe’s investigations, have raised a number of important issues and heightened awareness of the importance of human rights. The committee’s hearings, its interim report and this draft final report, have their counterparts in a number of Member States, where this matter has been the subject of parliamentary and judicial inquiries, many of which have not been concluded. Such is the case with the inquiries being carried out in my own country, where a committee of its parliament is considering issues raised by your own.</p>
      <p sl="de">Inquiries of this kind have in fact been called for in your report, and, with the subsidiarity principle in mind, this strikes me as the right level at which they should be held.</p>
      <p sl="de">My reason for saying that is that, in many areas investigated by the committee, the European Union itself has no power to act, and I am thinking here in particular of the monitoring of the intelligence services. This is something that the Council, represented by Mrs Lehtomäki and by its High Representative Mr Solana, has had more than one occasion to point out to your House and to the committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">You may well find that cause for regret, but the fact of the matter is that the treaties as they stand limit the Council's scope for action in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">It therefore appears to me that the report’s reprimand to the Council for having allegedly failed to cooperate sufficiently with the Temporary Committee is not, in the final analysis, justifiable in view of the fact that both the Finnish and German Presidencies took part in plenary debates on the interim and final reports, and that Mr Solana and the EU’s anti-terrorism coordinator, Mr de Vries, took up the temporary committee’s invitations to appear before it, where they, as they were instructed to do, answered all its questions.</p>
      <p sl="de">You will understand that I am unable, in this intervention, to discuss specific points in the report, for, firstly, I have no desire to pre-empt the various amendments that have been tabled, and, secondly, as regards the sections dealing with individual Member States, it is only right that the Presidency should abide by established custom and refrain from commenting in public on matters that are reserved to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The temporary committee has, as a rule, arrived at its conclusions – some of which are far-reaching – and made its critical comments on individual cases and Member States, on the basis of publicly accessible documents and important witness statements. Assertions have a habit of turning rapidly into facts, and the Council believes that, in a number of instances, rather more cautious language would have been desirable, since no final judgment can be passed on certain of the issues discussed without comprehensive knowledge of the documents.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do nevertheless think that the positions, on matters of substance, of Parliament and the Council are not as distant from each other as this draft report might lead one to surmise, and I am persuaded that all the EU institutions act on the basis of the same shared and inalienable values. In any case, the Council will continue to respect fundamental human rights and actively defend them both at home and abroad.</p>

    <intervention id="3-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the horrendous terrorist attacks around the world, security has become an essential right of citizens, so that we can all live in a world of freedoms and rights. Although security is undeniably one of the fundamental rights of citizens and enables us to exercise our freedoms, we must never forget – as I have often said before in this Chamber – that legality is an essential condition for guaranteeing the citizens’ right to security. In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have and cannot ever have security at just any price. Since these are our values, we must not be afraid or ashamed to address this subject here in this Chamber. It is a subject that we have sought to clarify and explain by means of Parliament’s work and the contributions that many of us have made.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, we must never forget that seeking the truth under the rule of law is based on identifying specific facts, which free and independent judges are then asked to investigate. It has been the duty of the national enquiries to ascertain the truth behind the pointers, allegations and facts, and to ensure that those responsible for any breach of the law are punished. There is no doubt that there are guilty parties, but it is not the job of the European institutions, Parliament or the Commission to hand down judgments, but rather to call for the truth to be ascertained. Clearly, the truth that emerges from the enquiries conducted under the rule of law may well result in fallout at both institutional and political levels.</p>
      <p sl="it">I applaud Parliament’s investigation for having come up with a number of facts that will be useful in pursuing the enquiries, as the rapporteur, Mr Fava, has just said. Thus it is the job of the judges to investigate and the job of governments – both those who have already done so and those who have not – to conduct administrative enquiries and to punish disloyal officials, because officials who break the law under cover of secrecy betray both their institutions and the State, and are therefore disloyal officials. In any case, once the facts have finally been established, governments have a duty to reveal the truth, however awkward and unpleasant it may be.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission’s role has been to help Parliament in its work by providing specific pieces of information, which have proved useful in Parliament’s investigations. Once the truth of the matter has emerged, if it ever does, the Commission’s role will also involve drawing conclusions from the results of the enquiries and at that point formulating proposals.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that parliaments and politics have a further job, ladies and gentlemen, which is above all to look to the future and suggest solutions to ensure that such events can never happen again. I am sure that everyone who has worked hard on this investigation has done so mainly to further the aim of achieving security within the law, and to advance security as a right. Security has not been just optional ever since 11 September 2001: it has been a fundamental right. I trust that everyone who has worked on this aspect is willing to continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why we need to think carefully about the role of the secret services. The President-in-Office of the Council has rightly said that we cannot have a European law on secret services, but we do need to organise some political reflection on their role. I am deeply convinced that these bodies are essential in combating terrorism, but governments must accept full responsibility for their operations and give them a clear and precise mandate. Rules are therefore needed at a national level: reforms are indeed under way in many Member States, including my own country. There is, however, one aspect on which I believe Parliament could usefully send out a message, which is that intelligence and security services – or secret services, as they are commonly called – should be subject to stricter parliamentary control, not to reveal their secret activities, which are essential in the fight against terrorism, but to report on the overall balance of their activities, in other words on what has been done as a result of the intelligence gathered. The idea, therefore, is not to disclose any secret information, but to examine in general terms the balance of their activities. After all, these bodies need to be supported, not discredited as if they were criminal organisations. Even so, I think it is essential for parliaments to exercise political control over them.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are also other aspects that deserve some thought at European level, particularly the use of airspace. Ladies and gentlemen, the use of airspace is one of the points highlighted by the Fava report. How can State aircraft – that is, those used in the service of the State – be classified? How can we distinguish them from civil aircraft? The Commission can make a contribution on this point, because our air traffic responsibilities may help in defining more reliable criteria for determining whether an aircraft is being used legitimately and for preventing abuse of the cover provided by a State aircraft when it is being used for purposes other than State service. That is a practical contribution that we can make.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should now like to put forward some purely political ideas. I think it would be a political mistake to give the impression that we are pointing the finger at the United States, although that is not the rapporteur’s stated intention. It would be a political mistake that I, quite frankly, would certainly not endorse. Instead, we should make it quite clear, first of all, that the ones in the wrong are the terrorists: in other words, the ones who have broken the law and are once again prepared to attack our democratic institutions. I am saying this because we must all realise that this murky affair, which is certainly full of irregularities, came to light precisely because of the great US democracy and its free press. Because of them, events began to be disclosed in the United States that have since been investigated by the European Parliament and other institutions, including the courts. You are all perfectly aware that the US Congress is still dealing with this affair, and that we intend to work hand in hand with the German Presidency throughout its period in office in order to revive Euro-Atlantic cooperation, on the basis of the two inseparable pillars of security and rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that we shall continue to seek the truth and, as is our duty, to collaborate with the United States as sincere allies, who tell the truth even when it is an awkward truth, and who call for those responsible for any irregularities to be punished. To conclude, please allow me to point out that, if Parliament is divided today on this very sensitive issue, it will weaken the message that you send out. If, however, you are united in giving out a firm message, on the one hand, and in reviving collaboration on rights and security, on the other, you will be showing how strong Parliament can be.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, right from the start of our work in this committee a year ago, we have tried to improve the report that is before us and to make it more balanced, more useful and more consensual. Today we have to admit that we have not succeeded. We started off on the wrong foot right at the outset: on our first visit to Washington, we presented ourselves in the State Department like a prosecuting court – I am sorry to disillusion you, Mr Frattini. Thus any dialogue that would have helped us achieve our purpose was made difficult from the very start.</p>
      <p sl="it">After our visit to London, the UK Minister for Europe wrote to his European counterparts advising them against meeting us. Although we had given up any hope of improving this report, we did make a last-ditch attempt at our meeting yesterday, when we highlighted some key points in our amendments which, if not accepted, would mean that our group as a whole would vote against the report. The rapporteur has already indicated, unless he wants to change his mind, that he will not accept our key amendments, and so everything suggests that we shall be voting against it.</p>
      <p sl="it">If I may take off my coordinator’s hat for a moment and speak on my own behalf, I have to admit that many members of our group would vote against it even if these amendments were accepted. I personally could only vote for it if two amendments that I have tabled were adopted, as they seem to me perfectly simple, linear and acceptable. The first one states that the secret services are so called because they are secret and they must be allowed to work in secret, so long as they do not break the law. The second states that the CIA can fly whenever and however it wishes, so long as it does not break the law. If these amendments are adopted, I shall also be inclined to vote in favour. The rapporteur has rejected them. I believe that refusing to accept these amendments means that the intention behind this report is not only to identify, accuse and punish the culprits, but also to condemn the secret services as such to inefficiency by subjecting them to full accountability and exposing them to every external threat possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why we do not like this report. We do not like it because it is useless. Mr Fava has said that I maintain that there is nothing new in the report. That is true: I do maintain that, and I am not the only one to do so. Someone else who thinks so is Senator Dick Marty, who was a great ally and supporter of his and was welcomed in our committee as a hero and leader. Today, however, now that your report has been finalised, Mr Fava, Dick Marty says that the document contains nothing new at all and that we have just copied what he had done previously; he says he is disappointed with the report, and the only difference compared with his one is that the document that has you as the rapporteur, Mr Fava, was drawn up by 46 Members and 13 full-time staff, whereas Dick Marty achieved the same result working alone.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having said that, Mr President, I should like to finish by emphasising that I agree with Mr Frattini: we certainly need to try to uphold human rights even in the context of the fight against terrorism. In this case, however, a document like this one is of no use, since it has already established a priori that there is an indisputable violator of human rights, in other words the United States, and only lines of enquiry in support of this idea are pursued.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the song of freedom cannot be played on the instrument of violence; that is a precise summary of what we are talking about here. We are talking about the core values of our European Community, of which we are rightly proud and which we rightly defend in our day-to-day work, in this House, and in this lucid report.</p>
      <p sl="de">International terrorism is indeed a threat to freedom and must be fought with all the means at our disposal, but this must be done on the basis of our national laws, of the European Convention on Human Rights and of international treaties such as the UN Convention against Torture. That, precisely, has been our concern in doing this work.</p>
      <p sl="de">This offence against international human rights and against the very foundations of European law must be denounced and punished. What has happened to these people – who include our European fellow-citizens – is not, contrary to what certain members of the committee would have us believe, a trivial offence; no, it is inhumane, it is immoral, and it is unjust. So what actually happened to the people who were abducted, sold, handed over, detained and tortured? Who caused it to be done and who had a hand in it? That is the truth that we had to find out – not the reason why the German citizen Mr El-Masri went to Skopje, from where he was abducted, taken to Kabul and tortured, or why the Turkish citizen Murat Kurnaz, who had been born and had grown up in Bremen, took himself off to Pakistan, whence he was sold, tortured and dragged off to Guantanamo. Neither of these men had been charged with any crime; neither of them had anyone to defend them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Had they been suspected of committing crimes, this would have been something for the prosecutors and the courts to decide; never before have we arrogated to ourselves this role, but there is no case in which the end justifies the means. What we do know is that CIA agents were involved in the abductions. Prosecutors in Milan and Munich have issued warrants for their arrest, which must now be passed on to the USA. We cannot, and must not, allow a secret service organisation to do as it pleases on our soil, with our governments being unable to defend themselves against it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We therefore call on the German Presidency of the Council to make it plain, on behalf of all the Member States, that they will not allow illegal practices and violations of human rights on their territory. In fighting wrongdoing of whatever kind, the law must not be broken, for we would thereby be betraying nothing less than that which we have inherited from our founding fathers, the very foundation of our Community. Europe stands for the rule of law, for separation of the powers and democracy; its politicians must take their stand for those things. As Lao Tse said many years ago, one is responsible not only for that which one does, but also for that that one does not do.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we do about this is also a matter of personal and political morality, and not just of jurisprudence. As I see it, the great achievement of this committee is to move this debate out into the European Union, into society and far beyond our borders. Europe must not become a stop on the road to Guantanamo.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Europe’s credibility is at stake here today. When we support this splendid report, which closes a year of hard and serious work in the committee, we will be showing a very strong concern, as great as anyone else’s, for security, and for security by all legal means, including the work of secret services, who can operate inside the law. We will be showing a concern for the legitimacy to protect our freedom and to protect the relationship with our closest allies. But we cannot support the idea that the only way to protect our freedom is through a dirty war. We do not like dirty war. That would represent – it has represented – a frontal attack on our values: what we stand for and what we preach.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have gathered together here a great amount of information that proves the existence of an illegal, sometimes criminal, scheme designed to fight terrorism, operating worldwide and assisted by the passivity, if not the active cooperation, of some European Member States, of some governments or of people under their control. The Council itself cannot be excluded from criticism of such passivity. We have not acted as a court. We are a political body and what we will vote on here is a political statement based on facts: facts that have been checked, facts that have been proved and facts that anyone who reads this document will see to be true, not with the sort of truth that can be proved point by point before a court, because we did not have the means to do that. Why not? Because many of the governments involved did not help us to have those means. But the facts are there.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not inventive imagination. We have met the victims – those who could come, that is, for others are still in jail. Some are innocents in Guantánamo who were taken from their homes after being cleared by a court. So we are making a political statement and sending a message to European governments and to the Member States. We are saying to them here, on behalf of millions of European citizens: you cannot do this in our name. You cannot fight terrorism through a dirty war in our name. Do not do that in our name because you are not representing us when you fight terrorism through these means. That is the statement that this Chamber will be voting on here today. You are free to support it or not, but that is what is going to be voted on here in several hours’ time.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Temporary Committee has worked for 12 months. In that time, the fears of those opposed to its formation have been justified. The committee has not been able to present any new evidence that Member States were engaged in illegal activity. It has simply compiled information on the activities of the media and Public Prosecutors in Member States. The latter have themselves taken the action required in a very few isolated cases, without any assistance from the committee.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The lack of hard evidence has driven the European Left to name and shame, regardless of the facts. There is an old saying that if the facts do not fit the accepted premises, so much the worse for the facts. That is the reason for the ridiculous allegations made against Mr Solana and Mr de Vries. It is also the reason for the ridiculous allegations against over half the Member States, concerning lack of control of their airspace, which is said to have resulted in individuals being thrown into torture chambers. It also accounts for the ridiculous language used in certain chapters and amendments. If all we can say, for instance, is that in Poland there is simply no evidence for or against the theory that detention centres existed in that country, it would be best to remain silent.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking in particular our rapporteur, Mr Fava, for the work he has put in, but also Mr Coelho, the chairman of our committee, and the members of the committee secretariat, who have done a splendid job. In doing this work, the committee has also afforded us a good example of good and successful cooperation with the Council of Europe and its special investigator, Mr Dick Marty. Our common effort also, wherever possible, involved national committees of inquiry, NGOs, the media – representing the fourth estate – and sometimes also cooperation with the executive, although we were, unfortunately enough, working against it for much of the time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want to take this opportunity to express my amazement at the way in which the Polish Government – the government of one of our Member States – treated the members of the committee like emissaries from the Warsaw Pact. It would appear that not everyone quite understands that membership of the European Union not only confers rights, but also involves the assumption of responsibilities. Those who have nothing to hide do not behave in such a fashion.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps what our committee has come up with should also result in us doing more serious thinking about how to protect human rights within the European Union, for, after all, the acquis communautaire does not cease to apply once a country’s accession is accomplished. I do not doubt that there is no shortage of things to be cleared up in my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany – the case of Abu Zammar, for example, in which it is evident that information supplied by the German authorities to the American secret services resulted in his abduction from Casablanca, in Morocco, and his rendition to Syria, where he was confined to a torture prison and interrogated by, among others, the German secret services. I would also remind you of the El-Masri case, which came to the committee’s attention; both Mr El-Masri and his lawyer are still waiting for an apology from the USA, and light still needs to be shed on the role of the former interior minister of the Federal Republic of Germany in it. Finally, I would also ask you to recall the case of Murat Kurnaz, whom the committee also interviewed. His lawyer has made serious accusations of mistreatment by members of the German armed forces in Afghanistan, and also of what appears to be the prevention of his earlier release, and I do not doubt that our counterparts in the German parliament will be investigating them. What one can say with certainty, though, is that neither the present German Government nor its predecessor have shown a great deal of empathy with him.</p>
      <p sl="de">In all these cases, I am confident that the Members of the Bundestag will do what they have to do with great care. The case that certainly had a particular impact on our committee was that of Maher Arar from Canada, which clearly showed how little security is enhanced by statements extracted under torture, and I am very glad to hear that he has been promised compensation. I do wonder, though, just what this compensation will do to restore to him the rights and the physical health he has lost.</p>
      <p sl="de">Consequences must also be drawn as regards those detainees who still remain in Guantanamo Bay, the Uigurs, Uzbeks and Saudi Arabians who cannot return to their countries because those countries do not recognise human rights. This is where we, in the European Union, have the chance to make our contribution by affirming that we have understood, that we are ready to learn from the mistakes of the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, then, this is not an exercise in anti-Americanism or in naivety in the fight against terrorism. Put simply and bluntly, this is about the values shared on both sides of the Atlantic, among which are democracy and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are taking an historic step, and for that I should most of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fava, and the chairman, Mr Coelho, for the work they have done in this committee.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament has very carefully pieced together the last few years of the perverse US strategy in the war against terrorism, which was based on the use of criminal methods and violations of human rights. It was only possible to implement this strategy because of the collusion of European governments and secret services. Condoleezza Rice even said so herself: ‘There has been no violation of national sovereignty.’ Some of the responsibility must also be laid at the door of the European institutions, starting with the remissness of Javier Solana and Gijs De Vries. In my view, however, we must also highlight the embarrassing silence by the President of the Commission, who was perfectly aware of US strategy while he was the Prime Minister of Portugal, to the extent that he organised the famous Azores Summit just five days before the start of the war in Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also believe that another point needs to be stressed: the Vice-President of the Commission stated in this Chamber that he knew nothing about the kidnapping of Abu Omar, which occurred while he was Foreign Minister in Italy. I believed him then and I believe him now, but a new fact has come up in the meantime which, I think, can help clarify matters: Admiral Battelli, the former head of the SISMI, has admitted that the CIA gave him a list of 13 alleged terrorists to keep under surveillance, including Abu Omar. The head of the SISMI must, by law, report to the government, and at that time Commissioner Frattini was the Italian Government minister responsible for the secret services.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, Mr President, the work that we have done has enabled us to bring a good number of facts to light, although there still remain others to investigate. We are confident that today’s vote will be useful in future, not only to say ‘Never again’, but also in discovering who else may be responsible. A great Roman historian once said, ‘They make a desert and call it peace.’ We think that peace is built by avoiding the desert, in other words by avoiding the death of the rule of law for the sake of the false fight against terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the essence of this report is the expression of two themes very popular with many Members of this Parliament: their inherent anti-Americanism and their never-ending desire to use any pretext to call for more powers to be given to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The kidnap, mistreatment and imprisonment without trial of suspects is wrong and, incidentally, that is why I and the UK Independence Party are opposed to the European arrest warrant and the UK’s current extradition arrangements with the USA. That being said, this report is speculative and lacks any firm evidence.</p>
      <p sl="de">The free democratic world is not engaged in a war on terrorism. This is a misconception repeated in this report. We are engaged in a war on ideology – a war we did not start. The ideology is that of fundamentalist and extreme Islam, an ideology without any humanitarian or civilised constraint. Thankfully, the United States of America is leading the resistance against it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I took part in the committee of enquiry as a Non-attached Member – except at the final vote when I represented the ITS Group – with the aim of trying to understand how much truth there was behind the accusations of collusion and complicity with human rights violations that had been levelled against the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let me say at the outset that, contrary to many committee members as well as the rapporteur and the Italian party that he represents, my party, the Fiamma tricolore , and I myself believe that Europe ought to be playing a different geopolitical role and, again contrary to what Mr Fava represents, I believe that the Atlantic Alliance is an outdated instrument, because it gives Europe a subordinate role. I would therefore have ideological reasons for criticising the activities – any kind of activities in general – carried out by the CIA or any other organisation operating on behalf of the United States and NATO inside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, I believe I am also being balanced and objective in decisively rejecting the conclusions of the Fava report, because not only is it flawed by its fundamental hypocrisy, in that it calls into question the operations of a State that is recognised and accepted as an ally, but it is tendentious and adds nothing new beyond what has already appeared in a number of newspapers. Of course, any violation of human rights is abhorrent and intolerable and must be rejected, but to insist on a presumption of innocence in secret service operations is laughable and could even be dangerous if its purpose is to protect the people and the State. The need for such protection is another reason why we cannot vote for the Fava report, unless many of the tabled amendments are accepted, particularly those by Mr Pirilli and Mr Gawronski.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this CIA Committee has been a ‘me too’ exercise from the start. The Council of Europe, under Swiss Senator Dick Marty, produced a report on extraordinary rendition, so the European Parliament had to do one as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">A British Government minister said that the Marty report was ‘as full of holes as a Swiss cheese’, and the Fava report is not much better. As Senator Marty has said, we, with enormously greater resources, have produced little solid material in addition to his own report. We have assembled a great number of press cuttings. We have collected flight information obsessively, with enormous lists of aircraft movements, and we are told that these aircraft may have been owned by companies that may have some connection with the CIA. However, we have no idea who or what was on these flights.</p>
      <p sl="en">All the way through our work we have sought to conflate flights with renditions. We have simply assumed that CIA flights equate with extrajudicial rendition of suspects. However, the CIA may have all sorts of legitimate reasons to move people and materiel around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">We went to Washington determined that senior US politicians should be made to confess their guilt, but we were met by a robust response. The US Administration admits that a few renditions took place in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, but far fewer than we wanted to see.</p>
      <p sl="en">We heard allegations from a number of people who claimed to have been subject to rendition, but with little supporting evidence. We went, at great expense, to Macedonia, but all we learned was that Macedonian hotels and border posts keep rather poor records.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that our whole exercise was designed to provide a platform for anti-American propaganda. We should all be ashamed of the deep undercurrent of anti-Americanism in this House. The Fava report is its latest manifestation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it was not enough to attack the US: we attacked Member State governments as well, accusing them of collusion with American security services. For my part, I should be concerned if European governments did not cooperate with the US in the war on terror.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, the virulent attack on my constituent, the British minister Geoff Hoon, by our committee Vice-Chairwoman Baroness Ludford, breached the norms of courteous political discourse and stands as a reproach to our House.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are right to insist on human rights and humane treatment for terrorist suspects, but we cannot expect either European or American security services to operate under constant scrutiny amounting to harassment from MEPs.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report will do little to promote human rights. What it will do is to give comfort and encouragement to the very terrorists who intend to destroy our way of life. If we approve this report, they will know that we are more concerned about the comfort of terrorist suspects than about the safety of the people we represent.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Frattini, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have five comments to make. The first is to thank the following people: Mr Fava for his high-quality report, and for all his efforts over the year in putting together this report; the committee vice-chairmen, Baroness Ludford, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Özdemir, for the close cooperation we enjoyed; the coordinators of the political groups and the members of the committee I chaired, as the report that has been submitted is also the result of their efforts; and the services that assisted us, for the very high quality of their work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, I believe that Parliament is fulfilling its role. There are those who would downplay or hide this issue, because it could be embarrassing to our allies. We have not done that. We have asserted our values. As Mr Frattini stated in the Chamber today, security cannot be at any price and therein lies the difference, not simply because they are our values but because, when we do not do so, innocent people always suffer. That happened in this case Our committee received some of the victims and heard their testimonies. I am appalled by the cynical attitude of those who feel that these wrongs are inevitable and that we should consider them collateral damage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, we have done our job without extending our mandate. We have not, as some would have liked, artificially extended our mandate in order to engage in political combat. We have assessed the facts, identified wrongdoing, pointed out omissions and tabled more than 40 recommendations to make it much more difficult for these things to happen again.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fourthly, we could have achieved more, and would have if we had received more cooperation. I wish to single out and thank the Commission for its outstanding help, and specifically Mr Frattini. Unfortunately, most Member States did not cooperate with us very effectively. For example, of the countries at the centre of the allegations of secret detention centres, Romania was extremely helpful, but cooperation from Poland was very poor. The latter was the only country in which not one government minister or member of parliament met with us. It is my understanding that this reinforces the suspicions falling on these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also condemn the lack of cooperation from the Council, which sent us truncated, incomplete documents, passing them off as authentic and original. This is unacceptable under the principle of close collaboration between the institutions. Mr President, I feel that improvements can and should be made to our report, but there is an issue of political responsibility with which we have to contend. Are we or are we not going to defend our values and our citizens? I believe that some in this House were genuinely convinced that these allegations were false and that nothing had happened, that is to say, there had been no secret detention centres, no torture, no extraordinary rendition and no illegal detention of prisoners. Yet in our committee we received various witnesses, and via the newspapers came the main witness, the President of the United States of America, who eventually acknowledged the existence of the extraordinary rendition programme. There is no longer any room to rebut the facts or deny the evidence. The time has come to work together.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall finish by saying that transatlantic dialogue and cooperation on issues of mutual interest must be stepped up with respect for our values, for our laws and for international law. That is what is at stake here today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Gloser, I am sure we all appreciate the significance of today’s debate. The Temporary Committee’s final report deals with issues of fundamental importance to the citizens of the European Union. I speak as a former political prisoner myself.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to say the following to the opponents of this report, to those who have subjected the work we have been involved in for over a year to derisory attacks. Party loyalties or ideological differences on many issues may divide all those who support this report. We are, however, united in the conviction that secret service agents must act within the law, and that nobody may be tortured or deprived of his or her dignity. This is currently the main political divide in the House. Is one in favour of habeas corpus or of granting the secret service a free rein? Is one in favour of secret isolation and detention centres or of the rule of law? Is one for or against the use of torture?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Many European governments and institutions have not made the necessary efforts to clarify the issues raised by the committee. I particularly regret the lack of serious cooperation on the part of the Polish Government, despite the fact that aircraft operated by the CIA made 11 stopovers at Polish airports in the context of extraordinary renditions. Polish Government representatives claim that there were no secret CIA detention centres in Poland. In my opinion, however, on the basis of the material gathered, and in view of the fact that no independent investigation into this matter has been conducted in Poland, the committee is not in a position to categorically exclude the existence of such centres on Polish territory.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, touching as it is to hear Conservative Mr Helmer defend the Labour Government, those who collaborate in refusing to face the facts on the grounds that an inquiry is anti-American will have red faces when the heavy guns in Congress turn their energies to this topic.</p>
      <p sl="en">European Commission President Barroso, who of course comes from the PPE-DE Group, the centre-right, wants the themes of accountability and promoting Europe’s values in the world to figure alongside security in the Berlin Declaration marking the EU’s 50th birthday in March.</p>
      <p sl="en">This serious and professional report, for which I thank Mr Fava, the committee chairman Mr Coelho and all the staff, is about accountability for human rights abuses which European governments did collude in or allowed to happen on their territory. It is about security, but built within a framework of law in which the security not to end up as a tortured ghost detainee counts too and it is certainly about promoting Europe’s values in the world, the ones of democracy, human rights and the rule of law to which Member States signed up in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with US Defence Secretary, Robert Gates, speaking at the recent Munich Security Conference about the West’s defeat of totalitarianism in the 20th century and our opposition to extremist ideologies now. He said: ‘Our most effective weapon, then and now, has been Europe’s and North America’s shared belief in political and economic freedom, religious toleration, human rights, representative government and the rule of law. Those values kept our side united’. Indeed, so why has the Bush Administration – not Americans as a whole – tossed away the moral high ground and dragged America’s reputation into the mud by a programme of kidnapping, forced disappearance, dark prisons, indefinite detention, cruel and inhuman treatment and outsourcing of torture? As Barack Obama has said, what the US needs is not to be feared, but to be respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not rejoice in the fact that the latest survey of global opinion finds an antagonism to America at an intense pitch. Even in Poland, fewer than four out of ten have a mainly positive view of the US.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe has failed a test in the last five years, a test of whether it will practise its values or only preach them. We have lacked the guts to refuse to collude with torture flights and lacked the vision to use Europe’s capacity to be a real and united best friend to America, and it is about time that we actually practised those values.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Fava’s report could be politely described as a curiosity or, more bluntly, as a scandal. After a year’s worth of work, the Temporary Committee’s report does not contain any information that was not already in the public domain. In other words, the committee has not unearthed anything new.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Instead of being presented with facts, we have been treated to verbiage comprising expressions such as ‘pays tribute’, ‘thanks’, ‘expresses its concern’, and ‘denounces’. The terms ‘regrets’ and ‘is deeply concerned’ occur at least 52 times in the 36-page report. The British, Irish, Austrian, Italian, Greek, Danish, Romanian and Polish Governments are mentioned by name in this negative context. The report is unreliable and tendentious. It puts forward opinions selected to fit in with the anti-American assumptions established at the outset.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I wish to make the following proposals. Firstly, the report before us should be rejected in its entirety. Secondly, clearly defined and content-related requirements for drafting reports should be laid down, so that debates on documents as embarrassing as Mr Fava’s report can be avoided in the future.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am proud of what we have achieved. At first, I had my doubts about how much we would actually manage to bring to the surface, precisely because secret operations are involved. It is true that we have not yet got to the bottom of this, but partly thanks to Mr Fava’s and Mr Coelho’s commitment, to whom I should both like to extend warm thanks for their work as rapporteur and chairman respectively, a ‘truth-finding momentum’ has been achieved, and there are various Member States in which it is being sustained. There are still people, certainly within the governments but also in this House, who would prefer to be left in the dark and for them, this report is not good news, because it definitely contains facts about people who have been abducted from European soil, about flights – note, Mr Helmer, the use of the word ‘flights’ rather than ‘renditions’ – via Europe in aircraft hired by the CIA. This report also reminds us of the hearings in which people have brought personal accounts and also reminds Member States of their legal obligations to look into alleged human rights violations, for that is what needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I was, in fact, delighted with the reaction from Mr Gawronski from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who said: ‘There is nothing new in the report.’ Nothing new, and I tend to share his view. The big question is, of course, just why the PPE-DE Group is voting against a report that contains nothing but known facts?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Whilst it is useful to look back, and I hope that the governments will at some stage have the courage to say that a number of things have gone wrong in the past, I also share Commissioner Frattini’s view that we should also look at what lies ahead. In this light, my group would, in six months' time, like a fresh debate with specific proposals for the future, about how we should, from hereon in, deal with extraditions and diplomatic guarantees, about the trial of alleged terrorists, about the control of secret services, even maybe about European control – this is open to discussion – of transnational operations. I hope that the PPE-DE Group will then be able to show itself to be more than just a negative force.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Canadian Government has accepted responsibility, apologised to Mr Maher Arar, and undertaken to pay him compensation. It testifies to the bankruptcy of Europe, the cradle of humanism, that not one single government there has to date thought it necessary to follow Canada’s example, not even the government of my own country, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, the word from Berlin is that the same decision would be taken today, and that no apology appears to them to be required. That sort of attitude leaves me utterly cold. That sort of behaviour is unworthy; it is shameful and unacceptable. I have no sympathy whatever for those holders of political office in my own country – its foreign minister, Mr Steinmeier, in particular – who have refused to appear before our committee or even to make any sort of statement on the suffering that Khaled El Masri and Murat Kurnaz were obliged to endure. They have gone into hiding behind the German Bundestag ’s committee of inquiry and were not even willing to turn up here in this House and give a statement – one without ifs and buts – to the effect that the war on terror must not be an excuse for the violation of human rights – not for anybody, whether secret services or those who occupy positions of political responsibility. Nobody in Berlin has as yet even asked themselves what they might do to ensure that such a decision would be taken differently in future. That fact, and also the obviousness of the party political manoeuvres now being attempted in Berlin in the hope of finding a watertight explanation for the abduction of Mr El Masri and the years of torment that Mr Kurnaz endured in Guantanamo, lead me to say that I have no sympathy for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament’s Amendment 224 either. I would ask the members of that group precisely what it is – despite the questions still left unanswered in Mr El Masri’s case – that prompts them to ask for a statement to the effect that the German authorities had no hand in the illegal abduction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Governments have the fundamental duty of investigating all human rights violations that are committed on their territory or against their citizens. They have to demonstrate that their conduct has always been correct and that they have acted in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the common fundamental values of the EU. That is why we have to do as we have been urged to do by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and adopt today a more strongly-worded report.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I have read Mr Fava's report very carefully; it contains a great many truths and we must congratulate him on that, but who is to blame for the situation which has been created? This is a situation which was created with the Normandy landing and we all accepted it. We gave America the right to be the boss of Europe, and that still applies today. These illegal flights bear witness to this fact. One in twenty of these flights is to my country, Greece. When we told him, the Prime Minister of Greece burst out laughing. When the local public prosecutor went to the airport, they refused to let him enter. My question is: can the Prime Minister of Greece enter this sort of American base? Can Mr Barroso enter the base in Souda? We have a state within a state. At some point we need to rein in this American suzerainty. It is leading us into an impasse. It is leading us into conflict; conflict with Russia, where in essence – according to the newspapers – the cold war has started, conflict with Iran and conflict with Iraq. A bad precedent has been set which we must stop right now. We must not be content with findings. We must take action to put things on an equal and harmonised footing with the Americans.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, tribute must be paid to Mr Fava for this report, which does justice to the role of MEP.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For four years, CIA flights transporting prisoners have been permitted to stop over in countries in which people actually voted in favour of the European Constitution and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We are told that the end justifies the means, but, on this point, the means that consist in infringing people’s dignity and torturing them have led to an all too familiar end: the breeding ground for Islamists has got bigger.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Fava has therefore taught us three lessons. Firstly, the United States has eternal leaders, Indians as in the Cold War and during the McCarthy era; it is the student of Carl Schmitt and Heidegger, one is either its unconditional friend or its enemy, as France was three years ago. The second lesson is that, for their part, the European leaders are the children of Machiavelli, and his doublespeak, and of Hanna Arendt, and her banality of evil.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third lesson to be drawn, and a message of hope is that Europe will never go away; it is seemingly led by sheep, but sheep that can be a match for wolves.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to succeed in fighting terrorism – one of the most menacing threats that civilised humanity faces – we have to fight it together, and fighting terrorism will necessarily involve the use of our secret services. The war on terrorism will, though, be won only if we maintain the standards associated with the rule of law and not lay them aside for the duration of the campaign. That much has to be clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Accusations have been made – which will have to be examined and investigated, and there will have to be consequences resulting from them – of the transportation of prisoners, their torture, and of the use of secret prisons. Of that there is no doubt, and the relevant public prosecutors have already started to take action, but what contribution does this report make to this? From the legal point of view, it is a collection of suspicions, with such phrases as: ‘the grave suspicion’, ‘the Committee is outraged’, ‘demands the disclosure of interview records’, ‘deplores the director of Europol’s refusal to appear’ – something that, incidentally, that person strongly disputes – ‘thinks it very probable that …’ and so on and so forth. This is not enough. It is quite obvious that the report does not meet the legal standards that we ourselves apply.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us just consider the most important point into which inquiry was made, that being the assertion that there were secret prisons in Romania and Poland. For that, the report furnishes not even a shadow of evidence; indeed, we find in it nothing that we could not already have read in the media, and that is why the report is a complete flop. More to the point, it is tendentious, as you will find if you read it and consider the general line it takes on the work of the intelligence services. As a result of this, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote to adopt it only if a degree of balance is restored to it by a number of amendments.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Fava, who, as I see it, managed to acquit himself of this difficult task with flying colours. The report does a good job of documenting the many facts that have surfaced surrounding the practice of illegal CIA flights and abductions and I agree with Mr Coelho that these cannot be swept under the carpet. I praise him for the way in which he has led the committee. The facts speak for themselves, but also leave questions unanswered. How much did the Member States know about the illegal activities? Whilst those who were prepared to enter into dialogue with the committee were unable to answer all questions, they did have a go, at any rate. There were others who simply refused to communicate with the committee. It is now up to the Council to react to the report. It may well be the case – as the President mentioned a moment ago – that the Council has no remit where secret services are concerned, whereas governments of Member States do, and so do national parliaments to a greater or lesser extent. Further research is called for, and that is also the main question to the Council, which we would urge to continue looking and checking whether Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are affected. I am completely at one with Commissioner Frattini’s remark that it is high time we looked into how our secret services are organised, and particularly their democratic control, and that better arrangements must be in place at European level about the use of our air space. In the final analysis, it is also a debate about the fight against terrorism, and particularly about waging this war on terrorism by means other than those used by the Americans. This is not so much criticism of America as it is a confirmation of our own values, our own guiding principles where the fight against terrorism is concerned. What matters most, at the end of the day, is adequate legal certainty for all citizens.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, this is not an exercise in anti-Americanism, for I should like to remind everyone that it is the American media that got the ball rolling on the basis of leaks from the American secret service, and that it was the American Congress and the judiciary that set limits to President Bush’s policy. In all honesty, I wish we in Europe would be as critical. We do not have a problem with the US, but with our own European governments that were aware of what was happening over here. The same, in fact, also applies to Mr de Hoop Scheffer, Secretary-General of NATO, whose unwillingness to put in an appearance I deeply regret. The Council should have the courage to launch its own inquiry on the basis of Article 7 and finally to come up with some answers for the citizens of Europe. It is, after all, true that we in this House have been unable to back up all the accusations with firm legal evidence, but then we are not a court of law. European governments, however, now have the moral duty to answer the questions that have so far been left open, for the accusations are extremely serious, and so I hope that today’s vote will give this report the broadest possible support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the great European witch-hunt is over. The good name of countries such as Great Britain, Italy, Poland and the United States of America is being burned at the stake.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report on the alleged CIA secret detention centres is tendentious and unreliable. It is based on half-truths, assumptions and allegations. It presents far-reaching conclusions, most of which are unsupported by evidence. Even so, the report has pronounced judgment and besmirched the honour of several states, just because they became actively involved in the war on terror, in cooperation with the United States. The committee’s work has proved nothing. It has simply condemned those who gave priority to the security of our families and countries over any imagined harm to terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We would do well to remember that terrorists do not recognise any rights, treaties or conventions. Paradoxically, today’s report gives the green light to terrorism. It demonstrates that, in the name of the new religion of human rights, Europe is prepared to provide greater protection for terrorists’ human rights than it affords its own citizens. The single reason for all this is the unhealthy anti-Americanism rampant in this House.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As it stands, the report compromises us in the eyes of Europeans who are expecting us to provide for their security, and not to be lenient towards terrorist suspects. We have become hostages to European prejudices and lack of imagination. This report should be rejected. Terrorism represents a threat of global proportions that can only be checked through transatlantic cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">United we stand, as the Americans said after September 11.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Fava report, contrary to what many people expected, has already had a catalyst effect, even before it has been voted on, of as yet unknown and unpredictable dimensions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Walls and blindfolds are gradually falling away, and the truth is flourishing. The European Parliament’s Temporary Committee, of which many people were initially critical, has far exceeded established expectations. Amongst other things, and thanks to the involvement of many other players interested in getting to the bottom of the issue, the work this year has had an effect similar to popping the cork of a champagne bottle which had been shaken for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="es">That would certainly have been a good and very pleasant metaphor, were it not for the fact that that bottle does not contain good champagne, but rather a dangerous combination of negligence, irresponsibility, criminal complicity and above all violations of the values and principles on which we claim the European Union to be based.</p>
      <p sl="es">The work cannot therefore stop now. On the contrary, we now have to focus all our efforts on getting to the bottom of it, no matter what. This must be done on at least three levels: by establishing committees of enquiry in the Parliaments of the States cited, which includes my country, Spain, assisting and encouraging the work of public prosecutors, and finally, on the part of the European Parliament, by monitoring how things develop as part of the permanent agenda of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as well as the Human Rights Sub-Committee.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, on 18 December 2001, father of five Ahmed Agiza stood waiting for the bus in Karlstad in Sweden. He had been on a Swedish-language course. The following day, he was sitting in a cold isolation cell in Cairo in Egypt. He had been tortured and humiliated, both on his removal from Sweden and in Egypt. This happened more than five years ago, and Ahmed Agiza is still imprisoned in Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Ahmed Agiza might just as well have been called Muhammad Al Zari, Abu Omar or Khaled El Masri or borne the name of any other of the prisoners imprisoned and tortured by the CIA, often in cooperation with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this report, we document 1 245 cases consisting of illegal CIA flights, illegal transfers and many instances of torture and other acts of cruelty. This is a report that demands legal investigations in those countries – such as my own, Sweden - that have not embarked on such investigations. It also demands compensation and justice for those affected. The report also demands that the Guantánamo prison camp be closed.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, when, in December 2005, this House decided to set up a temporary committee of inquiry, I deeply objected to it, since the Council of Europe was already carrying out an independent inquiry. What is the upshot of more than one year of hearings and study? After 130 hearings and a host of trips, the committee of inquiry has managed to drag up little more than what Dick Marty managed to do on his own for the Council of Europe. Could an indication of costs be given of the inquiry carried out by the Committee of Inquiry into flights and detention (TDIP) compared to those of Mr Marty's inquiry?</p>
      <p sl="nl">A temporary committee of inquiry cannot force the Member States, Europol or NATO to cooperate. It will not receive any more information than it already has. A Member State’s decision not to cooperate with this inquiry should not lead to that Member State being discredited. The suggestion to remove Member States’ voting right in the Council by way of punishment for cooperating with the CIA is reprehensible. It is time the European Union and the United States joined forces in their fight against terrorism, and, since this can be done only on the basis of mutual trust, let us make a start on creating some.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it would appear that, in the war on terror, all means are justified and it is evident that no rights are sacrosanct. The EU ought to have made a forthright statement at the time when news reached us of the inhuman conditions and torture in contracted-out American prisons, and there ought to have been resistance on our part when the CIA started to indulge in its illegal practices in EU Member States as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not only did this constitute an abuse of our own much-vaunted values, but we also stood idly by – and were even supportive – while international law was broken and human rights violated, and now the European taxpayer is supposed to fork out for the misdeeds of the world’s self-appointed policeman, the USA.</p>
      <p sl="de">This return to the Stone Age of human rights is, in my view, a real disgrace for the European Union. We must not allow ourselves to be reduced to the blindly obedient vassals of the USA, let alone to being the paymasters of its belligerent policies. I believe, then, that a forthright declaration on the part of the EU and an apology to the victims are long overdue.</p>

      <p sl="en">S-au emis până acum păreri că acest raport are tendinţa de a prezenta puncte de vedere negative despre Statele Unite ale Americii sau despre serviciile secrete. Eu cred că, datorită faptului că majoritatea afirmaţiilor se bazează pe supoziţii şi nu pe fapte clare sau dovezi, este un raport care exprimă până la urmă poziţii care aduc prejudicii ţărilor membre şi implicit Uniunii europene ca ansamblu.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unul dintre principiile de bază ale Uniunii Europene este apărarea drepturilor omului. Este adevărat că preşedintele Bush a declarat că au existat zboruri care au transportat persoane şi că au existat centre de detenţie, dar nu a făcut nicio precizare clară referitoare la locaţia acestor activităţi. Mi se pare exagerat să încercăm să ne acuzăm noi înşine fără a avea nicio dovadă în acest sens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Apărarea drepturilor omului este o obligaţie a tuturor statelor membre. Aceeaşi obligaţie există însă şi în ceea ce priveşte asigurarea securităţii cetăţeanului. Este normal să se facă anchete atunci când există suspiciuni în acest sens, aşa cum România a făcut, dar nu cred că este normal să se considere că aceste anchete au fost superficiale dacă nu s-a ajuns la o anumită concluzie dorită neapărat de cineva. Cred că trebuie să ne respectăm reciproc ca democraţii şi instituţii parlamentare.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consider incorect ca despre România să se vorbească în subcapitolul Secret detention facilities , neexistând nicio dovadă în acest sens, sugerându-se astfel o presupusă încălcare a drepturilor omului, în vreme ce despre alte ţări, în conformitate cu articolul 150 din raport, să se vorbească despre existenţa cazurilor din capitolul Extraordinary rendition . Cred că este o dovadă a unei abordări incoerente.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Fava on the very thorough work that he has been doing for a year now and by also thanking Mr Coelho for his impartial chairmanship.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many EU Member States have failed in their duty to uphold and protect human rights, and we need to seize the opportunity presented to us to finally make our declarations on human rights correspond to the practical measures that we are taking in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also a question of demonstrating the strength of the European Parliament, which must remain impartial and independent, and, in this respect, the Fava report should serve as an example. I would encourage the European Parliament to systematically take up any instances of human rights violations that occur. We must be able to express ourselves freely and we must show that we are impartial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This painstaking work has not been in vain, since the investigations were carried out in several Member States and the public was aware of what was at stake. Let us not forget that we are accountable to our electorate. The recent release of Abu Omar and his account of the torture and abuse that he suffered show that Mr Fava’s work has not been in vain. We must continue this fight to learn the truth about each and every case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we need to send out a strong message to all of the authorities in charge of the secret services in order to make them understand that events of this kind can no longer take place without the European Parliament reacting.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we who have been elected as Members of this House are called to observe and protect our common democratic values, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is what we are talking about today, about European democracy, in which the law should be enforced as the highest authority. No more, no less. It goes without saying that cooperation with, or granting permission to, the extraordinary transfer programme and secret prisons, be it tacit or explicit, conscious or unconscious, is not in keeping with what all of us have subscribed to by means of international and national law. Let it be clear that the obligation to respect, protect and promote human rights is binding at all times. Terrorism must, and indeed can, be fought and beaten by legal means. It is unacceptable to sacrifice or restrict human rights arbitrarily, for that does no more and no less than play into the hands of the terrorist. It is therefore an impertinence to let party-political or national interests prevail in this matter or to launch into anti-Americanism. Mrs Sophia in 't Veld was right: the Americans owned up to their own wrong-doing quite some time ago.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The EU’s credibility is at stake. This is a case of collective responsibility, and the Council should, therefore, face up to its own. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a restriction in the treaties is no excuse whatsoever.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, some people are arguing that we should all support this report because otherwise we are not standing up for human rights. I have to say that I completely and totally disagree with that. I oppose flights of extraordinary rendition anywhere, but I cannot support this report because I believe many of its conclusions are politically motivated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be clear. We are talking about conclusions and not findings. This is not an evidence-based report. For example, reference to 147 suspected flights into Ireland or 300 flights into Germany is totally unsubstantiated. If these conclusions were presented before any court as factual evidence, they would be thrown out of court because they would be found to be both inaccurate and speculative.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament should remember that many of the things in this report are conclusions and not findings. For a report to conclude that all CIA flights should be banned in Ireland and not be banned in any of the other 26 Member States, lacks perspective and is another clear example of how politically motivated this report has become. This report does not look forward. It even fails to call for a review of the 60-year-old Chicago International Convention. However, I do have an amendment on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some people are saying we should come back in six months’ time with proposals. If we have proposals they should be in the report today. I believe that this report is full of conclusions and not findings, and very unfortunately I will be voting against it.</p>

That investigation is therefore needed.</p>

They are the same people who supported the Iraq war, that illegal and immoral war that has created a less just and less secure world. The long arm of the CIA can be seen, and it can be seen in certain speeches, I understand that, but these Members must appreciate that we are now holding a different debate.

CIA flights and secret prisons are only a part of this frightening development, and it is appalling that EU countries - including my own country, Sweden – have contributed to it. These Member States excuse themselves by stating that they had obtained diplomatic guarantees that those extradited would not be tortured, that their innocence or guilt would be established in fair trials and that they would not be condemned to death.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the work of this committee and the report by Mr Fava, regardless of the way each of the Member States is treated, raise, in my opinion, one or two fundamental issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first is whether, in fighting this phenomenon that is truly striking at our society, the phenomenon of terrorism, everything is permissible. What we need to know is whether we want to build a European Union that is a community of law, in which we draw up laws with the obligation to comply with them and in which human rights are respected and safeguarded, or whether we want to take the view, Mr President — and this is the second element — that this legal area and this area of values that we want to build must be and can be compatible with a friendly and balanced relationship with the United States, an active and positive partner of the European Union, within the context of the transatlantic relationship.</p>
      <p sl="es">The answer must be yes, because when tackling the phenomenon of terrorism, which threatens all of us equally, with the law on our side, the response must also come from all of us equally.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to make two comments, Mr President, with regard to Mr Fava’s report. In spite of the tireless work that he has done, many Members of this Parliament believe that the report does not add anything to other reports, such as that of the Council of Europe or certain information that has appeared in the press. One fundamental conclusion can be drawn. Despite the existence of a European Coordinator in the fight against terrorism, and of a High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Union does not have competences in this area, since they lie with the Member States. I believe that, in this field, the European Union must take a decisive and firm step in the right direction with a view to resolving these shortcomings.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall end, Mr President, by saying that there are Members of this Parliament who by hitting — or believing they are hitting – the wall with a hammer, believe they are driving in nails. It is regrettable, Mr President, that people should take every possible opportunity to condemn the judicial limbo of Guantánamo — which we clearly do not like — while remaining ominously silent over the regime that is really harming Cuba, which is the Castro regime, a silence that demonstrates double standards and regrettable moral bankruptcy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, remarkably, the only governments that have to date officially admitted knowledge of participation in the secret CIA renditions and flights are those of the United States and of Bosnia and Herzegovina – that is it! One therefore has to wonder whether the European Council and Member States will continue to stick their heads in the sand in the event that President Bush makes good on his statement to keep utilising the same illegal operations whenever or wherever he sees fit.</p>
      <p sl="en">To avoid the future occurrence of these or similar illegal activities, practical steps must now be taken. The Council should officially condemn these activities and enquire into Member States’ and its own knowledge and participation. The Commission should examine all agreements and arrangements with third country military and secret services to ensure that they respect human rights and fundamental rights. Member States should establish official inquiries on the CIA flights that landed on their territories, set the actions of secret services under the democratic control of the governments and instruct their airport authorities to check all suspicious private flights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the European Parliament should submit its report to the next European Council meeting and ask that a discussion of its conclusions and recommendations be placed on the Council’s agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">No one in this Chamber should be anti-American or pro-American, a defender or a detractor of any specific European country or government. We are all pro-European; we are Members of the European Parliament and, as such, we have an obligation to uphold European values and laws against whoever violates them – friend, foe or even ourselves.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to mention that the right to the sanctity of life and to human dignity – which is upheld in the loftier part of the Fava report – is an absolute value in which we all believe and for which we are prepared to fight.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Fava goes further, however, and becomes a one-sided inquisitor: he grants this right to terrorists but not to the secret agents incriminated and arrested in Milan by a judge who has denied the head of the Italian secret service, General Pollari, the right to a defence, since he has rejected his request to call the previous Head of Government, Silvio Berlusconi, and the present incumbent, Romano Prodi, as witnesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Fava criticises, condemns and deplores all the governments of Europe, in addition to the US Administration. It does not matter to Mr Fava that an undercover intelligence operation and the squeezing of a terrorist’s right to human dignity may have prevented a repetition of the Twin Towers tragedy. The report criticises, deplores and condemns all the governments of Europe, whether on the right or on the left, as well as the Council of Europe itself, as being guilty of colluding with and submitting to the hated enemy George W. Bush.</p>
      <p sl="it">Can it be that only Mr Fava is right and that the judges of just three countries – Italy, Spain and Germany – are the heroes of this report? Yet the centre-left Italian Government under Romano Prodi has challenged the documents – the ones produced by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Milan – before the Constitutional Court in order to protect State secrets. For Mr Fava, only terrorists have the right to a defence. General Pollari, the head of the Italian secret service, should not defend himself: he is guilty. He cannot reveal, however, that Abu Omar, a suspected CIA agent, was picked up to save him from certain death, so much so that he was not taken to Guantánamo but sent back to his own country, and he is now at liberty. Abu Omar is a CIA spy. General Pollari is right, but it does not matter. Human rights law has been violated and that cannot be tolerated, not even if it was done to save human lives and ensure the security of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">A great mentor of mine, the jurist Salvatore Pugliatti, used to say that laws are female and can be violated, whereas the Law is male and cannot. We are on the side of the Law, and not of laws.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was opposed to the Temporary Committee from the very start. It has proven to be an expensive exercise. We do not have any figures, but I estimate the cost to be over EUR 1 million. It has duplicated Senator Marty’s efforts in the Council of Europe and has produced nothing substantially new which was not already in the public domain. Regrettably, the Left and Liberals cannot resist an opportunity to bash NATO and the United States, which, in spite of making mistakes, remains a democracy that shares European common values and is our ally in the fight against global terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Fava report is heavy on allegations and accusations, but light on conclusive proof. Inevitably, some mistakes and excesses may have occurred, but in my opinion there was no systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to illegally torture abductees in third countries, or any proof of the existence of CIA detention camps in Romania or Poland. Where there is evidence of wrongdoing, such as in Italy, the national criminal justice systems have kicked in and started prosecutions. Simple renditions of illegal combatant terrorist suspects through EU territory are a proven fact, but are not necessarily illegal in international law where torture is not involved, and diplomatic assurances to the Member States do offer safeguards in extradition cases to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also seeks to extend the powers of the European Parliament into areas like security and counter-terrorism, which are more properly the remit of national parliaments and governments. I particularly dislike the request that the British Government extend consular protection to former UK residents who had not bothered to become citizens, but chosen instead to travel to dangerous parts of the world. This is contrary to all the traditional obligations and rights of citizenship of our Member States. Finally, calls for Article 6 and 7 sanctions against Member States are totally unacceptable in my view.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I wish to extend warm thanks to Mr Fava and Mr Coelho for the outstanding work they have done. It has been demonstrated that a number people were abducted from European soil by American entities, and this was, in my view, very definitely illegal. Not as much has come to light as some might well have expected, but that is attributable to the tactics of obfuscation adopted not only by the USA, but also by many European governments. Today, again, from what I hear, a number of Members of this House are more interested in getting the fog generator up and running than in getting at the facts of the matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may turn to my own country, Austria, the report does indeed refer ‘only’ to the abductions of non-Austrians outside Austrian territory, but this is not about people’s rights as citizens; it is about their rights as people! The fact is that, if people are abducted and put into the hands of ‘judicial authorities’ that are known to use torture, some of them extensively, then it is scandalous that European governments do not intervene and see that justice is done, whether or not the persons in question are citizens of the states over which they rule, for they are, in any case, human beings who are living legally in our European countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also think there is something highly problematic when a number of governments simply fail to respond, and when a number of national parliaments do not take seriously the obligation incumbent on them of getting to the bottom of what has been going on. I do think that this House, in setting up this committee, did the right thing, for it makes it a matter of record that we, in this House, are committed to human rights and to those rules that are necessary in order that those rights be indeed recognised and put into practice in Europe. That is the point of this committee, and that is the conclusion to which its report brings us.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the CIA committee was emphatically not a court, and the report is definitely not anti-American or an attack on the United States. Those who say that it is, including Mr Tannock, are wrong. Too many fellow Members appear to be prepared to close both their eyes and their ears to the acts of cruelty that have taken place. There is too much in the way of coincidences, circumstantial evidence and sheer proof for us not to know that repeated violations of fundamental human rights have taken place in the fight against terrorism, and this on European soil. Those of you who deny that this is so need to prove your case.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In my own country, Sweden, we know what happened. Two Egyptians were deported from the country with the help of the CIA and, in addition, the Swedish Government. The criticism of Sweden is entirely justified and should not be softened, as Mrs Segelström proposes it should be.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let us learn our lesson for the future and strengthen the EU’s ability to take action in support of human dignity, and this in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty. Terrorism must be fought, but it must be fought using the resources of the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, after a year of hearings and questioning, we are bringing the work of the committee of inquiry into the CIA to a close. What will be crucial, from the point of view of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is whether we will, today, vote on this report on the basis of facts and proof, or whether suspicions and insinuations will prevail.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is for this reason that we in the Group of the European People’s Party will be unable to vote for the report’s adoption if it continues to make reference to matters that we have not been mandated to consider; if, as well as taking an unbalanced view of individual Member States, it also indulges in baseless suppositions concerning the presence of secret prisons on EU soil, contains unsubstantiated assertions, generalisations and tendentious insinuations and demands disproportionate action against certain Member States, including, for example, the suspension of the right of one of them to vote in the Council, and, finally, if it depicts the activities of the intelligence services as criminal in nature.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one thing I would like to make clear, and it is that Mr Fava’s original report is one we can largely live with. If today’s vote gets us back to that; if Mr Fava accepts the amendments we have tabled in the interests of objectivity and clarification, then we in this House will be able today, by a broad majority, to produce a balanced result, something that contains a clear vote for our understanding of the rule of law and for the defence of our fundamental rights and freedoms, while also showing that we have faced up to our responsibility to conduct an objective investigation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would, though, like to make it no less clear that we will not be able to endorse the report if the rapporteur ignores our key amendments.</p>

      <p sl="es">What has happened is extremely serious and we must not pretend it is not. On the contrary, the political leaders of the Member States and of the European Union must investigate, clarify and explain to the citizens the extent to which each party is responsible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Illegal CIA flights, though they are in themselves flagrantly illegal, were simply one instrument in a cruel and entirely illegal system of detentions, interrogations, torture and disappearances. There is no getting away from the fact that there is ample evidence to make a political judgment unreservedly condemning this huge operation put together by the Bush Government and supported to a greater or lesser extent by certain European leaders.</p>
      <p sl="es">Can there be any greater hypocrisy, Mr President, than to condemn Guantánamo in this House, to call for its closure and then to send police officials to interrogate prisoners? The fight against terrorism will continue to be one of the European Union’s priorities, and we will need the greatest possible cooperation with our North American ally, but that will only be possible if there is mutual trust and full respect for the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="es">This House must send out a crystal-clear message. Europe has already learnt the lesson of torture, of detentions without safeguards, persecutions and concentration camps. It is on the basis of those painful experiences that we have created democratic rules and international law and we are not going to give them up, not even in the name of global security. Mr President, what is at stake today is not the credibility of the Bush Government, whose anti-terrorist strategy has failed. It is our credibility. It is our credibility that we are talking about.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the committee has very successfully reconstructed the activity that the CIA, with the active or passive cooperation of the Member States, carried out on EU territory. We know, for example, that the same aircraft made 99 flights between Frankfurt and Ashkhabad in totalitarian Turkmenistan. Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Jordan and Libya were also important destinations, and President Bush has recognised that there were secret prisons outside the United States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There is some soul-searching, involving internal investigations, going on in the Member States. A state of affairs that, a year ago, was only hinted at has now come sharply into focus. That constitutes considerable progress. If we do not manage successfully to combat terrorism through lawful means, we cannot set an example to others, either. This is important. We must achieve a better balance between society’s demand for security and the rights of the individual. We cannot win the fight against terrorism by no longer protecting human rights and so bringing about a state of affairs desired by the terrorists.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United States of America is a good friend of Europe, of the European Union and of each individual Member State.</p>
      <p sl="el">This huge country is at the epicentre of international terrorism and it is only natural that it should also have the central role in combating terrorism. It makes mistakes and the criticism which we are exercising is about these mistakes. It is not because we do not support the efforts it is making to combat terrorism. It is wrong to believe that any criticism exercised about certain actions by the CIA contains an element of anti-Americanism. It would be a huge mistake if, in order to avoid the possibility of being misunderstood for anti-Americanism, the European Parliament closed its eyes to violations of human rights, violations of international law and violations of the principles and values for which this European Union exists.</p>
      <p sl="el">In any event, what has been reported to the Commission is happening. The facts exist. Guantanamo exists. Extraordinary renditions are happening. Illegal detentions are happening. Are these not violations of human rights? What do you want? For the European Union to come along and say, 'As the ends justify the means, we accept these violations'? No, we shall not be accomplices to this position.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the end of the day, Mr Fava's report contains conclusions based on facts. However, there are inaccuracies and conclusions that do not strictly substantiate these facts. This does not mean, however, that, on balance, it does not set the problem in its right dimension. That is why I personally propose, especially if Mr Fava and the others accept the basic amendments, to vote in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I wish to commend Mr Fava on this report, which saves Parliament’s honour and Europe’s credibility, when so many government officials and politicians are dismissing it, on the pretext that they have seen nothing, know nothing and have done nothing but help the allies in the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report describes in detail the lack of control at European airports, which enabled the CIA to operate a fleet of private aircraft in what is referred to as 'extraordinary rendition’. It demonstrates that US military planes were also used for the illegal transport of prisoners, at least to Guantánamo, and that these planes stopped off at airports and military bases on European territory, the facilities of which were subsequently used as temporary detention centres under the guise of operations such as 'Enduring Freedom'.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Not only did the European governments authorise, knowingly or otherwise, such transport, compromise the security of their countries and of Europe and undermine the services charged with ensuring that security, they also sullied the good name of the European military institutions and made them, objectively speaking, complicit by commission or omission. The report also proves that European governments, including the Portuguese Government, continued to authorise, or to fail to control, flights to Guantánamo; they continued, quite openly, with illegal imprisonment even after this temporary committee of the European Parliament had been set up; and they sought to keep national and European members of parliament in the dark regarding these operations. In this way, they did not collaborate in the fight against terrorism; methods such as these will never enable us to bring the real terrorists to justice.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the report shows how fragile the basis is for democracy and respect for human rights in the EU countries. The countries of the EU cannot wash their hands of the illegal action taken in the war on terror and simply blame the Bush administration for the excesses and human rights violations. The United States of America could not so act if several other countries did not approve of the illegal action and aid it, or even take a direct role in its global aspects. The EU countries have had a primary role in this. They cannot say they are not responsible for their territory, their airspace and the safety of people inside their territory.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In short, anti-terrorist action cannot be beaten by renouncing human rights. Finally, I wish to say that during the Second World War we were united by a common opinion on human rights which stretched across the Atlantic Ocean.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this report is, for the time being, the last one in a year of intense activity in the temporary CIA committee, and I should like to thank both Mr Fava and our chairman, Mr Coelho, warmly for their commitment and, above all, for their patience. After all, not everyone was happy with the committee being set up, because it is true that it was not a real committee of inquiry with judicial powers and because an inquiry into possible violations of human rights had already been mounted in the Council of Europe. Today, however, both its advocates and its opponents will have to admit that this committee of inquiry has definitely done a useful job. It is, of course, true that we could not expect a solid burden of proof, and we did not always get it, but what we did get was factual elements. Many eyewitness accounts and official visits have exposed a system from which the simple conclusion can be drawn that various European Member States were very much aware of illegal practices, while others did not know what went on on their territories. I find both conclusions are equally painful. What did come to the surface very clearly was the difference in opinion between Europe and the United States about the way in which a balance should be struck between the fight against terrorism and respecting fundamental and human rights. It is not a coincidence that this discussion, as are the conclusions, is consistent with the conclusions involving the SWIFT affair and the discussion between the EU and the United States with regard to the transfer of passenger data. I should like to make one observation in this connection. Although we have all examined the same facts and heard the same eyewitness statements, the conclusions vary widely, and at times, the discussion is based too much on ideological motives or national interests. I still hope that this House will be united in this afternoon’s vote and will be sending out a clear signal, because there is no room for bargaining where the protection of fundamental and human rights are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I endorse this report. It is a courageous report, which condemns practices that are an insult to human rights. Few European countries have been spared. What about Belgium?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Have CIA planes flown over its airspace with prisoners on board? The Belgian investigation reached some negative conclusions but acknowledged that the authorities did not have a mandate to monitor air passengers in transit. Doubts will therefore always persist, as they will in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The committee of the Belgian Senate described in detail the incidents that initially took place in its investigation, not least the reservations expressed by the secret services. The President of the Senate, Anne-Marie Lizin, did not hide this, when she came to give evidence in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In June 2006, the conclusions of the investigation were voted on in the Senate and made public. All that might therefore be said of Belgium is that it is a complicated country, that the Flemish and Walloons would be better off getting on with each other and that we do stupid things on the television. But not that it is not a great democracy that values transparency. We have put our own house in order, and I hope that the report at least acknowledges this.</p>

      <p sl="en">I see this report as an opportunity for the Member States to take a good look at themselves and recognise that it is a fact that fighting terrorism has often justified the adoption of many intrusive laws. It is now urgent to undertake an evaluation of all anti-terrorist legislation. It is time to ensure judicial control mechanisms and strict parliamentary scrutiny of security services in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Romania, where new legislation on secret services is being adopted, it is advisable to look at this package of legislation from this particular angle. New bodies that centralise intelligence are being created for better coordination of secret services. We have to be careful and place these central bodies under enhanced parliamentary control. This report is crucial because it highlights the increasing prevalence of the mantra ‘security at all costs’. It depends on us to focus more on civil rights and earn the confidence of our people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there is every indication that Mr Fava’s report will not be adopted by a unanimous vote. This can only mean one thing, namely that the report contains more conjecture, political comment and opinion than plain facts and logical conclusions drawn from the latter. We would all support the report if it contained nothing but facts, because nobody can deny facts.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is evidence that political intentions took precedence over the truth, facts and common sense in the course of the committee’s work. The report contains a sentence stating that Poland and the United States signed a secret agreement, whereby foreign agents acting on the territory of the Republic of Poland would not be subject to the jurisdiction of Polish courts. A letter from the government to our committee was quoted in this connection. The difficulty is that the letter in question confirms precisely the opposite. The question then arises as to what might be the ulterior motive driving those who proposed such statements in the report and who support them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our committee’s work has also produced some very important and much-needed conclusions. Presumably, we all agree that security is a fundamental human need. Accordingly, efficient and well-organised secret services are required. As they strive to protect the lives and health of their citizens against threats, including terrorism, these services not only can, but also must, cooperate effectively with the services of other states.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Can the activities of the secret service of a European Union Member State be free from any kind of control by its parliament and courts? The answer has to be no, it is simply not possible. There is, of course, room for debate as to the extent and intensity of such control, but if these services are not subject to any kind of control, they tend to subdivide into smaller units and operate on the principle that the end justifies the means. This is particularly important in countries where the government has a monopoly on authority and tends to use such services for its own purposes, to attain aims it alone is privy to.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, when we set up the committee of inquiry, we did so on the understanding that we wanted to seek new knowledge, that we wanted to get at the facts, and that it would be necessary to take appropriate action if it turned out that human rights had been violated. This report, though, with its 270 amendments, now contains facts and new information only in part, but, on the other hand, numerous suppositions, assertions and – as it did before – insinuations. I am sure that the rapporteur, Mr Fava, does not want that any more than anyone else does. The principal impression given is that the USA is in the dock, and so, if it is, the terrorists who really should be in the dock are no longer the principal subject for consideration in the report. If that is the case, then that is a political error all round.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report also, however, contains errors of fact concerning Europol, for example, which is alleged to have cooperated with the American secret services; the claim is also made that American secret service agents had worked at Europol as liaison officers. Even though Europol’s director, Mr Ratzel, wrote a letter to make the facts plain – namely that Europol is of course not a secret service and cannot exercise a coordinating role over the services in Europe, and that, of course, no liaison officer from an American secret service department has ever worked there – the factually incorrect account remains in the report. This does damage to this House’s credibility, and we must firmly repudiate it.</p>
      <p sl="de">If various items founded solely on assertions and insinuations are dressed up as facts and then not voted out of the report, or if false accounts of events are left to stand, then the report is not doing what it was supposed to do, and then we have to ask ourselves whether the EUR 2 million that were needed for the committee of inquiry can be regarded as a justifiable expenditure.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Amnesty International has talked of the CIA’s methods in terms of torture to order. That is precisely what this is about. We have documented the flights, kidnappings, abductions and deportations that have been carried out as completely unacceptable. In the case of Sweden, we are concerned here with the deportation of the two Egyptians following a government decision on asylum, as well as with what happened at Bromma Airport when the deportation was implemented. In that case, the CIA went too far in violating the common rules that Sweden has supported nationally, in the EU and in the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am pleased that we have agreed that diplomatic assurances cannot be used as guarantees in the case of deportations to third countries and that a foreign power cannot take implementing decisions without the national police taking full responsibility, even if the case concerned is one of suspected terrorism. Moreover, victims must obtain redress and receive compensation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What would worry me is if the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats were to take their lead from the CIA committee and vote against the report, as it is especially important in Sweden that the Swedish Conservative MEPs should vote in favour of the report and so enable us to agree that there should be no repeat of these matters and that, although terrorism must be fought, it should not be fought through the violation of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Thank you, Mr President. Seven months ago, I expressed the hope that the final report of the Temporary Committee would strike a better balance than the version that was current at the time. I must say today that this is unfortunately not the case.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This report, which sends out an important message to the European people and to our partners, mixes fact with speculation, deals selectively with results of the investigation, assesses individual countries on the basis of whether or not they have cooperated with the committee rather than what they have actually done, and makes a whole range of accusations with scarcely any evidence. Naturally, with the committee’s limited powers it was not possible to substantiate a number of the claims.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Sadder still is the fact that we have relinquished the one ambition that had a chance of succeeding under these circumstances, namely a proposed framework for effectively combating terrorism without hindering human rights, and for ensuring, via workable proposals, that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, guaranteeing the citizens’ security is the basic duty of any government. With the army and secret services facing exceptional circumstances, mistakes do occasionally occur. We now know that this has happened since 11 September. It is extremely important that these excesses are condemned. I feel it was a big mistake of the committee to try deliberately to create the impression that such excesses were endemic, rather than being isolated cases, in spite of the fact that there is not a single shred of evidence to support that view.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Some MEPs have been making unfounded accusations that this is a political report, not a legal document. I should like, if I may, to remind the Chamber of our duty – both to our electorates and to this institution – to provide information in a balanced, objective manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the main merit of the Fava report is that it puts in a clear light our values and our weaknesses. Its main message is that we should never seek more security at the expense of human rights. Moreover, there is no contradiction between defending security and defending human rights. We could, indeed, consolidate our security only if we respect our basic values. The terrorists want to undermine our values and make us abandon our way of life. We can defeat them precisely by defending our values and by refusing to abandon them.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was not possible to prove beyond any doubt that certain violations of human rights took place in specific countries and with the cooperation of specific governments or of specific officials. However, it is beyond any doubt that unacceptable acts could have happened without being noticed by the national institutions concerned, without shaking the public conscience or without being resisted by the European Union Member States, since they apparently lack the capacity to oppose. Thus the report led us to the conclusion that we need better cooperation in the field of intelligence, as well as in the field of direct action against terrorists, in order to increase our strength in coping with security challenges, without decreasing our capacity to respect and promote human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need a better joint educational effort in order to raise the general respect for human rights and to encourage political leaders to look for a better equilibrium between values and Realpolitik . We need more political solidarity among the Member States in order to make them less vulnerable to the pressures of those political players who believe in the power of force. We need a common foreign and security policy that will allow us, at the same time, to deter the terrorists and promote our values in the world. We need a transnational democracy that is able to strike a balance between effective security services and popular oversight of their activities. To sum up, we need more Europe.</p>

We have it straight from President Bush that he will continue with extraordinary renditions and with secret detention centres. Member States, the Commission and the Council have an obligation to take on board our one hundred or more recommendations on getting to the full truth, preventing abuse of human rights and torture and ensuring our intelligence services are accountable to our parliaments. To be successful in countering terrorism, we have to defend our democratic and our humanitarian values, not abandon them as too costly or inconvenient. Otherwise we concede victory to those who want to destroy those self same values.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to urge Members in particular to reject amendment 38 from the UEN Group, which seeks to create the fiction that the problem is an outdated Chicago Convention. The problem is a failure by Member States to actually implement the Chicago Convention.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to focus on one argument that we have been hearing from the right wing of Parliament, which is that the report by Mr Fava is somehow a stick for the European Left to beat the United States of America with.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I simply do not share that view. The social and political systems of the European countries and the USA are built on a set of shared values, which include basic human and civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. These democratic values include the checks and balances that are imposed by parliaments and other bodies on the exercise of power. The European Parliament fulfils this role within the framework of its authority.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The fight against terrorism is one of the major challenges of our times. We can overcome this evil only if we work together, both in Europe and the USA, and if we have collaboration, of course, from the intelligence services. This fight must be pursued as part of our shared, transatlantic democratic principles and values. Otherwise, the terrorists will achieve their aims. Success for them is to destroy our democratic way of life, both in Europe and the United States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The individual presentations have already contributed a great deal of important information. A deep blow, both moral and ethical, has been inflicted on the European policy of protection for human rights and liberties through the unwillingness of senior representatives of the states concerned and of the Council to provide our committee with the relevant information, and they bear a collective responsibility for this unprecedented deception, which undermines public confidence, as well as the political and moral credibility of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">What is striking, in view of the facts published, is the stand of Javier Solana, who, in this most important case, has buried his head in the political sandbox of his own interests and ambitions, adopting an approach of see-no-evil, hear-no-evil and speak-no-evil. Mr Solana, in his capacity as our most senior foreign policy representative, has clearly fallen short of our expectations. On 2 May 2006 he claimed in his address to the committee that he is not aware of anything and has no information which might help to clarify the circumstances of this unprecedented case. So it is quite proper to ask the question: who failed? Was it Mr Solana himself? Was it his administration? Or was it a system that facilitates the concealment of violations of human rights? Whatever the answer, in this particular case Mr Solana should take ultimate personal responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Hungary and the Hungarian Government can be proud of the fact that they did not get mixed up in the CIA’s illegal actions in Europe. Among those who did cooperate, we can find both so-called ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States, but fortunately the majority of the new Member States did not take part in these shameful actions. This further indicates that making such a distinction makes less and less sense in political terms.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The fight against terrorism is our common cause and responsibility. Yet we are fighting terrorism precisely in order to defend our democratic society, laws and customs of the rule of law. If we give these up, then we find ourselves on a dangerous moral slippery slope.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The United States is an important ally, but just as we must fully observe the local laws on American soil, so we must expect the same from American authorities in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I welcome the report of the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, and am particularly pleased that Amnesty International also supports the report. In the final days of Communism I was one of the founders of the Hungarian branch of Amnesty International, and I have been following their work with great interest ever since. I am glad that in this matter as well, I agree with them.</p>

    <intervention id="3-069" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Gloser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, in this debate, you have expressed your views on many of the conclusions to be found in the report from the temporary committee on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, and your contributions have indeed been very diverse, although, notwithstanding that diversity, I have had my impression confirmed that the great majority of your House endorses the fundamental position that, while, on the one hand, the war on terror is indeed necessary and legitimate, the end does not, however, justify the means, or – to put it another way – that the means used must, if this war is be won, be lawful.</p>
      <p sl="de">The last speech again addressed the Council, urging it to act, but, as I said on the Council’s behalf at the beginning of this debate, the Council itself has no powers in this area, and I must repudiate the accusations levelled in one of the last interventions at Mr Solana, for he has certainly offered, in this matter, whatever cooperation he was able to give.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, something else that emerged from the debate is that numerous initiatives have been taken in the Member States, primarily on the part of their parliaments, and these investigations are in line with the demands made in your report. While I see it as right and proper to set such investigations in motion in order to bring the facts to light, I also find it regrettable that there are various points in the report at which suppositions are made out to be facts.</p>
      <p sl="de">In response to Mrs Kaufmann’s reference to the cases in Germany, I have to say – albeit without wishing to pre-empt the Bundestag ’s interim report – that the investigations have revealed that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the German authorities; in particular, no evidence was found to back up the recurrent allegations to the effect that German officials had known of Mr El-Masri’s arrest and rendition.</p>
      <p sl="de">The committee of inquiry is also considering the case of Mr Kurnaz, and it has come to light that the US Government did not, in 2002, offer to release Mr Kurnaz in the manner surmised by the report. The committee will, however, continue to consider this matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">In response to your various references to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union, let me say that you may perhaps regard this as an argument from formality, but the Council is not entitled to initiate action of this kind.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner Frattini also mentioned the role of the secret services, and there were also contributions from the floor that stressed the importance of their work, although it has to be said that the question of on what basis that work is done is of course an important one. That, too, though, is a task primarily for the nation states, and it is, in the final analysis, the parliaments who must define the demands to which these secret services are subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">Reference has also been made, in some speeches, to relations across the Atlantic. It has to be said, in general terms, that, in the fight against terrorism, measures in the interests of internal security that are generally applicable rather than limited to one Member State of the European Union can in fact be undertaken only in very close cooperation with the United States, and that cooperation needs to be developed.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important, in this cooperation across the Atlantic, to make clear that the war on international terrorism has to be waged on the basis of the common values on which the European Union and the United States agree.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-070" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to all the speakers as well as those who have acknowledged the contribution that the Commission and I myself have made to the work of this Parliament’s committee of enquiry.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the principle on which we can all agree is that security and fundamental freedoms cannot be pitted against one another. There is no contradiction between citizens’ right to security and proper, scrupulous respect for people’s fundamental rights. In connection with the fight against terrorism, we are also aware that, if even a single violation is found to have been committed during the investigations, the courts are then bound to punish those responsible for this violation and to reject that evidence, and that then allows the terrorists to strengthen their propaganda against us. That is a triple setback in the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why the rules must be obeyed during the investigations, not least for a reason that is intrinsic to our strategy in the fight against terrorism: if the rules are in fact broken, the law also ends up being broken, which is bad enough in itself, and above all we do not actually get to convict the terrorists. I have to say that there have been too few actual convictions of terrorists for extremely serious crimes throughout the world, compared with the number that have been investigated.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that the added value of this parliamentary investigation will be clear even to those of you who have expressed your doubts today. First of all, it will have added value if – as I myself hope and as many of you have said – we refrain from claiming that the report is a condemnation of the United States, and instead we declare that we want to ascertain the truth without making any blanket condemnations and without passing judgment, which is the job of the courts. Moreover, I believe that even those of you who expressed your doubts in your speeches can accept that this is an important report, provided that we emphasise one point: this report makes no decisions on events for which there is as yet no proof, since that will have to be established by the national enquiries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall also take this opportunity to reject with absolute indignation the completely unsubstantiated allegations against President Barroso, which fortunately were only made by a single Member of this Parliament, Mr Catania: these are unworthy and unfounded accusations, and I feel duty-bound to emphatically reject them.</p>
      <p sl="it">The added value of the investigation, which has culminated in Mr Fava’s report, lies in Parliament’s sending out a message of unity and firmness, particularly to terrorists. In my view, this message should make it clear beyond a shadow of doubt that the power of the law and of respect for fundamental rights will enable us to strike an even stronger blow against terrorism, rather than a weaker blow. The political message to terrorists must therefore run as follows: they should not see this as good news, because abiding by our laws and punishing those who break them makes our institutions stronger rather than weaker, precisely because terrorists break the law whereas we must obey it.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why I still hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a large majority, so as to encourage the Member States to fulfil their institutional and moral duty by establishing the whole truth and tightening up the rules in future, starting with the rules governing the secret services.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we need greater Euro-Atlantic collaboration, greater collaboration with the United States, for the sake of the dual principle of security and respect for the rights of the individual. This, in my view, is the political lesson that we can learn from today’s debate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">What does the report by the temporary committee tell us?</p>
      <p sl="pt">that there is an ongoing programme of kidnappings of ‘suspects' (a fact confirmed by George W. Bush), who, without being charged and without any guarantee of respect for the most basic right to a defence, are subsequently held in illegal detention centres and are brutally tortured;</p>
      <p sl="pt">that the Member States were aware of this ‘programme' as part of EU-NATO relations (senior members of the US Administration have made assertions of this nature, which have not yet been refuted), but exerted no control over their air space and airports as they are duty bound to do;</p>
      <p sl="pt">that the alarming lack of firm answers from the bodies that should be the first to take the initiative of clarifying the situation only serves to reinforce the validity of these already well-documented allegations;</p>
      <p sl="pt">that far-reaching investigations must take place, via commissions of inquiry set up in the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Such conclusions justify the stance of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), which has long been condemning these criminal acts perpetrated by the US Administration in violation of international law and the most basic human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The PCP tabled the initiative of setting up a commission of inquiry in the Portuguese Parliament in order to obtain clarification, to bring those responsible to account and to prevent these atrocities from continuing to take place.

      <p sl="hu">The activities of the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners serves primarily a moral function. For it has now been proven that there are moral demands that cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the fight against terrorism, illegal tools cannot be used, for doing so will produce the opposite effect from the one desired, and will in every case come to light. The work of the committee may perhaps have an effect on the future of the Guantánamo detention camp as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Earlier, the Council of Europe also prepared a report on the CIA flights. That Council’s report contains several concrete cases, but the European Parliament did not even strive to draw up its own catalogue of the many concrete – often hear-rending – cases examined during the hearings. The committee’s goal was to draw lessons for the European implementation of general, universally recognised rights and principles, and to focus on what remains to be done. Member States should examine from a legal perspective their anti-terrorist as well as their air traffic legislation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Although the EP officially has no influence on the decisions of Member States, I hope that the result of the final parliamentary vote will have an effect on Member States, the various institutions, and in the long run may even be able to influence the American approach. We must recognise the importance of the fight against terror and of the successes achieved in this area by the United States. Action against terrorism cannot, however, mean immunity from the obligation to respect human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">However well-intentioned the motives may be behind this report, I am concerned that its only result will to damage EU-US relations. Those of us who have had the privilege to serve on our parliamentary delegation for relations with the United States have worked for many years to seek to achieve good relations. It would be unfortunate if a report such as this – which may make good headlines but which, it has to be said, carries little substance – was to undermine that work. While this is not a legislative report, surely we still have a responsibility to take a water-tight legislative approach. Stating that there may have been secret bases or that certain names coincide with media reports does not satisfy such a legislative approach. When we decide to look into an issue of such public interest, we have a responsibility to ensure that we are contributing to establishing the truth surrounding it rather than falling into the trap of fuelling speculation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Before starting the vote, I am going to give you some important information in this regard, particularly in relation to the vote on the Fava report.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As you know, the Fava report, which we debated on Monday evening, is a report for which there are many amendments. I am used to chairing the vote, but I have never seen such a thick dossier for a single report. However, we might be able to speed things up.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This has nothing to do with any foreign power intervening; the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is simply proposing that some collective votes be held in order to enable us to save at least half an hour. The problem is that this proposal arrived very late in the day and that your voting lists could not be adapted to incorporate it. Therefore, if you agree to some collective votes being held, you are going to have to pay very close attention to your voting lists. The layout itself of the list has not changed, we will follow the same order, but we will go a little bit quicker.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I should like to know whether the House agrees with this proposal, which is going to save us some time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am making this proposal on behalf of my group and under Rule 155(6) of the Rules of Procedure: I propose a block vote on 122 amendments that are complementary to each other, in order to simplify procedure. In any case, these amendments are workable in relation to those that I propose should be put to the vote individually. Each of these in fact makes its own main point: from violation of State secrecy, to the security of European citizens and States, to the faked kidnapping of Abu Omar, a CIA spy, who was picked up to save him from certain death and not deported to Guantánamo, but sent back to his own country, where he lives under suitable protection and gives interviews.</p>
      <p sl="it">The amendments to be put to the vote separately are therefore the following: 71, 73, 113, 114, 115, 121, 122, 124, 210, 212, 213, 214 and 216. I also propose individual votes, amendment by amendment, from 38 to 69 and from 245 to 256. All the other 122 amendments can be put to the vote as a block.</p>

      <p sl="fr">If we had known about this proposal beforehand, we could have gone ahead with it.

The fact that the amendments of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group have been withdrawn from the voting list is currently causing confusion amongst many Members; they think that they are voting on the Union for Europe of the Nations Group's amendments when in fact the vote relates to the original paragraphs.

      <p sl="unknown">Mr Napolitano, it is with the greatest pleasure that we welcome you to the European Parliament as the President of the Italian Republic. You are, of course, very familiar with this House, as you have been an active and respected Member yourself. I take this opportunity to offer a warm welcome to your wife, Mrs Napolitano,</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">who is with you today on this visit to the European Parliament and is watching from the gallery. You led this Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs wisely and effectively, displaying staunchly pro-European beliefs that you have kept intact in your current position as the Italian Head of State.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I am also delighted to greet everyone who is watching this event live on television in Italy, as well as the students and staff in many Italian universities who are linked up to Parliament via satellite as part of the project titled ‘Towards the European Constitution’.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr President, let me, today, welcome you, Giorgio Napolitano, the dedicated European, most warmly to the House of which you were formerly a Member.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Fifty years on from the signing of the Treaties of Rome, you, both in your person and by virtue of your office as Italy’s supreme representative, demonstrate the central part that your country has played in the process of European integration. You embody Italy’s European tradition, which goes back to Alcide de Gasperi.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">‘From Rome to Rome’ is the phrase often used to sum up the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, but it is not only Rome that is at the heart of European history, but other Italian cities as well. The Messina Conference in 1955 was aimed at leading Europe – then only recently united – out of the crisis resulting from the rejection of the Defence Community. The European Economic Community was founded less than two years later.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr Napolitano, Italy has always been one of the main pillars of the process of European integration. We are confident that your commitment and that of your country will help to move this process swiftly forwards once again. Therefore, President, please take the floor to address the House.</p>

    <intervention id="3-098" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Giorgio Napolitano" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Italian Republic">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, I am sincerely grateful for your kind words of friendship towards me and towards Italy. They reflect the feelings and the efforts that we shared during the period when we worked most closely together. Above all, we collaborated in our respective roles in producing the Constitutional Treaty, for which you now reiterate your staunch support. Allow me, then, to offer you my sincere compliments in return, and my very best wishes at the start of your important mandate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Poettering, Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on coming back to this Chamber I have the same feeling of belonging that inspired me throughout the years that I spent in the European Parliament: belonging to Parliament as an institution and belonging to Europe. I had been a member of my own country’s national parliament for decades, but I at once felt at ease in taking up my duties as an elected Member of this House when I was called upon to join it. I felt no awkwardness, because the European Parliament, at least since 1979, has had the same dignity, authority and democratic legitimacy as any other freely elected parliament. I felt no contradiction, either, because I have always believed that there should be no misunderstanding or antagonism between national parliaments and the European Parliament, but just mutual respect and fruitful cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Most of all, I have always been convinced that one can represent the views and interests of one’s own country just as well in the European Parliament as in one’s national parliament: here, in the Chambers of Strasbourg and Brussels, one takes a broader view of problems and choices that have to be understood in a European dimension, yet also in the interest of our national communities. What unites us all is precisely the sense of belonging to Europe, seen as a common heritage of values and ideas, traditions and hopes, and as the prototype of a new political and institutional entity capable of rising to the challenges of the times in which we are living and of the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p sl="it">That explains the special kind of experience that one gains in the European Parliament. The political representatives acting here are not bound by restricted, divergent national outlooks and, even though they may well differ on certain issues, including important ones, and on votes that are certainly significant, they largely agree in their view of the basic objectives that must be pursued in order to further the integration of a united Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">When – as has happened so many times over the course of the decades – there has been a choice between pushing forward to broaden and strengthen European unity and just marking time or even pulling back, the European Parliament has always played a dynamic role: it has sent out a clear message, backed by a huge majority, to push ahead with developing the Community and broadening its horizons and ambitions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, with the first elections to the European Parliament by universal suffrage in 1979 – an important event – it had seemed that consolidating the parliamentarian and constitutional nature of the European Union would inevitably follow, in order to strengthen the democratic bases of the integration process, to guarantee the citizens their rights and the chance to participate. The European Parliament moved in that direction when, on 14 February 1984 – exactly 23 years ago today – it approved the draft Treaty establishing the European Union. The draft, which had been drawn up and debated at the instigation of Altiero Spinelli, unfortunately never became a Treaty and, despite the long and far from fruitless journey that followed, often inspired by the proposals of Spinelli’s draft, a number of issues remained unresolved and were to surface again.</p>
      <p sl="it">When, on signing the disappointing Treaty of Nice, the governments agreed on the need to address the major themes for the future of Europe and to launch a genuine constitutional process, Parliament committed itself wholeheartedly to making its contribution by helping to seek adequate solutions to the questions raised in the Laeken Declaration of December 2001.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament can indeed feel proud of the dynamic role that it played more than ever at that time, especially in the Brussels Convention – in its working groups, its plenary sessions and its Praesidium.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ladies and gentlemen, 2001, 2002 and 2003 did not see a pause; rather, it was a time of serious, genuine and profound reflection. The material that was then put forward to the Intergovernmental Conference for final decision was a text packed with analysis that had been considered and discussed at length. The outcome was undoubtedly a compromise, but not a poor one: a middle ground was found between diverse viewpoints; each side, including Parliament, had to sacrifice its demands and proposals to some extent in order to arrive at an agreement that could actually advance the cause of European unity and integration.</p>
      <p sl="it">Well, ladies and gentlemen, can we perhaps now blithely say that that Treaty – it is no accident that it is called ‘Constitutional’ – is dead? Is that extraordinary, prolonged political and cultural effort destined to end up in oblivion? Are the signatures of 27 Heads of State or Government at the foot of that text now worthless? Of course, we are all too aware of the traumatic effects of the votes against ratifying the Constitutional Treaty in the referendums held in two of the six founding countries of the European Community. We are equally well aware of the issues raised by the spread, in other countries as well, of doubts and scepticism about the path that Europe should take and about the European Union’s current situation and future prospects.</p>
      <p sl="it">In reality, we are paying the price for having made little effort to involve the citizens in the major decisions about European integration and unification, or to inform public opinion in every country about the extraordinary results and progress that we have achieved in 50 years and the new, ever more pressing needs to strengthen the EU in terms of its cohesion and its ability to act. All of that, however, must not lead people to underestimate the reasons for the Constitutional Treaty signed in Rome in October 2004, or the solutions that it contains. These are practical, albeit partial, responses – which we need to ensure are better understood and appreciated – to the citizens’ own demands, including their demand for more transparency and democracy in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">While the Constitutional Treaty represented a happy middle ground overall, it must be remembered that a good compromise means accepting certain ideas and giving up others. People should not forget that when they say they are going to rework the 2004 text: nobody should think of shifting the balance of the established compromise to the benefit of his or her own views. Starting new negotiations may be like opening Pandora’s box, with the risk of having to start again from scratch and begin a debate when nobody knows what the outcome will be or how long it will take.</p>
      <p sl="it">Eighteen of the 27 Member States, representing 275 million European citizens, have ratified the Treaty: they deserve our respect for having upheld the commitment signed in Rome. It is quite clear, mind you, that the majorities that voted against it in the French and Dutch referendums must also be treated with respect, and that every effort must therefore be made to clarify the concerns that led to those rejections. The time has come, however, for Europe to find a way out of the impasse. No one can seriously claim that, after its huge enlargement, the EU does not need to redefine the overall framework of its values and objectives or to reform its institutional structure. Working on a draft Constitution for Europe was not a formalistic exercise, nor was it a whim or a luxury: rather, it was a response to a profound need in Europe at this moment in its history.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nor can the Europe of projects or results be put forward today as an alternative vision and strategy. Admittedly, Europe has certainly not stood still for the last two years. It gave the most telling proof of what it can achieve on the international stage when it succeeded in speaking with a single voice on the war in Lebanon, thus launching a dynamic new mission for peace in that region and throughout the Middle East. Alongside this renewed political initiative, some further items to write down on the credit side of the balance sheet for this period are the drawing-up of some important directives and the agreement on an albeit limited increase in the meagre financial perspective for 2007-2013. This was achieved with substantial input from the European Parliament through the powers it gained under the codecision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nonetheless, ladies and gentlemen, the EU cannot go very far down the path of results with its current institutional framework. It is certainly important to sketch out and propose new Community policies, as the Commission did recently on the environment and energy issues, which have now become major, critical problems because of climate change and the tensions over oil and gas supplies. We know from long experience, however, that Commission documents, communications and even legislative proposals may produce scant results or only very slow progress. That is shown, for example, by the long, hard road towards a European immigration policy, which has already taken many years. We also remember how the introduction of the single currency was not followed up with the economic governance that would have been necessary, not least to ensure that the objectives of that great project, the Lisbon Strategy, were effectively met.</p>
      <p sl="it">What, then, are the decisive factors in making projects thrive and in making a Europe of results really grow? The strength of the institutions and of their political commitment is decisive. It is decisive that the Union should have institutions that are stronger than the resistance put up by those Member States that are still closed in on themselves, defending anachronistic prerogatives and vain national pretensions. The Constitutional Treaty cleared away any fear or suspicion of a swing towards a centralised superstate by more clearly enshrining the distribution of powers and guaranteeing respect for the principle of subsidiarity. It could be claimed instead that it did not go far enough in adapting its operating rules and decision-making procedures to the challenge posed by the enlarged EU or in introducing the new Community policies that are needed.</p>
      <p sl="it">The most decisive steps forward in the Constitutional Treaty were towards a common foreign and security policy, an effective European area of freedom, security and justice, structured cooperation in the defence field, and enhanced cooperation in other fields. If, however, talks were started all over again and some party began to question those innovations, starting with the appointment of a European foreign affairs minister and a European department for external action, you can be sure that somebody else would demand instead that the 2004 Treaty be supplemented or expanded with bolder and more consistent new measures to push the integration process along. For example, the proposal to extend the scope of majority decision-making within the Council might understandably be tabled again, not least because getting rid of the unanimity rule and the veto does not prevent but rather encourages people to seek broad understandings and to reach acceptable agreements quickly. Similarly, another point that would be put forward again if talks were restarted would be to get rid of the need for unanimity regarding future reviews of the Treaties and their entry into force.</p>
      <p sl="it">All parties therefore need to have a good sense of realism: realism together with a determination to keep in check the tendency – which has resurfaced again – to weaken and water down the choice that was made more than 50 years ago now. What was chosen then was the prospect of a Europe that was able to integrate, a single yet plural entity enriched by its diversity, aware of its common heritage of civilisation, and strong through combining cooperation among national governments with a new supranational dimension. We are about to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, and it is important to use the occasion to reaffirm that prospect and that choice, while clearly setting out our new rationales and our new ambitions.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Community idea was born in Paris back in 1950, however, when the very distant goal of a European Federation or a United States of Europe was first sketched out. Today, we confidently expect Paris to make a reliable contribution to overcoming the crisis that began with the failure to ratify the Treaty in 2004. Our partner, France, has such a keen sense of its role in Europe and the world that it will not fail to provide us with its now decisive input.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have drawn your attention to a few of the essential points forming the backdrop to the decisions that have to be made in the near future, without going into detail about the manifold legal, technical and political ideas that have recently been advanced in the search for a way out of the institutional impasse. Italy has every confidence in the German Presidency’s commitment, both to the principles and values that the Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, referred to in her speech in this Chamber, and to reaffirming Europe’s objective of adopting the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">Whatever form the roadmap that is now being mentioned may take, it is important to agree that the citizens need to see the Constitutional Treaty already in force, together with its message and programme, before the elections are held in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="it">On that basis, my own message and programme is to appeal to the sense of responsibility and the political commitment of all those in positions of leadership in our countries. No one can deny the extent of the new threats, challenges and opportunities facing us. Europe will only be able to influence international relations and global development, recover its drive and dynamism, and count for something in the world if it strengthens its own cohesion and unity, by swiftly equipping itself – as a Union – with the institutions and resources that it needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">The alternative – as we must realise – is a dramatic decline in the role of all our countries, indeed, in the historical role of our continent. Allow me to repeat the words with which Jean Monnet ended his memoirs in 1976: ‘We cannot stop when all around us the whole world is on the move.’ Thirty years later, those words are even more true: they buzz in our ears like an insect from which we can no longer escape. The leaders of all our countries must therefore show that they are equal to this awareness and this responsibility, and they must be able to release a new European political will. The European Parliament must shout louder than ever in calling for consistency and courage, as in the past.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy will play its part, Mr President; it will make its contribution as it has done ever since the integration process began. This contribution is symbolised by the figures of a far-sighted statesman, Alcide De Gasperi, and of a passionate prophet and fighter for the European idea, Altiero Spinelli, the centenary of whose birth we are celebrating this year. In referring to their example and in reaffirming Italy’s European commitment, I know I can speak for my country as represented by all of its political groups together and by its citizens’ heartfelt beliefs. At the same time, I have tried to address you, ladies and gentlemen, on a more personal note, as dictated by my strong feelings. Sitting on these benches and working in this Parliament taught me more and more clearly that one can only serve the cause of our peoples, our nations and our joint future by working for a united Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I do not think that the Commission has cleared it up terribly well, but I think it is not withdrawing its proposal, and so we need to clarify the legal situation. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented the second report on voluntary modulation after the referral of the first report back to committee in November 2006, under Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure. As no agreement was possible with the Commission, the committee has had to reiterate its position, so we are dealing here not with a new report, where Rule 52(3) may be applied again, but with the confirmation of the first report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Legal Service of the European Parliament, with which I have consulted on this issue, has informed me that, in our specific case, the last sentence of Rule 52(4) has to be applied mutatis mutandis , which means that we have the vote on this legislative resolution and that a second referral to committee according to Rule 52(3) is not appropriate, so we are not referring it back to committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">I propose, therefore, that the House should vote in favour of Parliament’s legislative resolution because we have already rejected the Commission’s legislative proposal. Therefore, the ball is now firmly in the Commission and Council’s court. We await a new proposal with great interest.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We opposed the setting up of the special committee because we believe that suspected crimes should be investigated by the judiciary. Responsibility for investigations has, in the first place, been exercised at national level. For example, the Swedish constitutional committee has examined – and passed judgment on – the Swedish Government’s conduct. The issues mainly dealt with by the report are those coming within the competence not of the EU but of the Member States. On these issues, the governments of the Member States are responsible not to the European Parliament but solely and exclusively to their national parliaments as long as no European legal rules have been broken. If Member States have failed to comply with commitments at European level, it is the Commission’s responsibility to investigate such violations and to go to court in connection with them.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am voting for this report by my colleague Mr Fava on the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners. Let us be clear that I do not agree with everything in the report. There are a number of highly contentious elements, including gratuitous references to the former Secretary of State for Defence in the UK, which we have rejected here this morning. It has been claimed that much of the argumentation is not evidence-based. One could say the same thing about the case for intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld: there are things we know, things we don't know and things we don't know we don't know. Well, here I know that our Temporary Committee and its rapporteur Mr Fava have identified a serious abuse of human rights in breach of international law in the Union. My vote is to endorse that clear overall finding and not the associated detail, which, inevitably in the absence of clear cooperation by the authorities, is speculation, which, while often right, is from time to time wrong.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The argument used by the German Presidency to shrug off the problems and shirk its political responsibilities regarding the ‘use of European countries by the CIA for the illegal transportation and detention of prisoners’ comes as a surprise. Believe it or not, the Council claims that the affair lies outside its remit, even though it adopts one political position after another on whatever it considers to be of interest, and even though it is abundantly clear that these issues have been addressed as part of EU-NATO and EU-US relations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It has once again been demonstrated that such attitudes are, at the very least, indicative either of an attempt to provide a smokescreen for this unacceptable violation of international law and the most basic human rights, or of connivance with, and even subservience towards, the USA.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report drawn up by the temporary committee – which provided many of the victims with an identity and a voice – represents a further contribution towards the emergence of the whole truth and will help the national parliaments, the bodies actually charged with carrying out checks and balances on the behaviour of governments, to do their duty.

      <p sl="en">Today’s report by Mr Fava raises some critical issues which are about the core fundamental rights of everybody in Europe and across the world.</p>

The Irish Government’s hear-no-evil, see-no-evil approach to illegal renditions is unconvincing and unacceptable.

The German Federal Government – a coalition composed of conservatives and social democrats – can no longer avoid facing up to the consequences, even though it is obvious that it has been in response to pressure from it that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament have watered down some of the report’s language. The European Parliament has come to the conclusion that, ‘according to information given by Murat Kurnaz's lawyer and information provided by the German authorities, there was a prospect of the release of Murat Kurnaz from Guantánamo in 2002 but this was not accepted by the German authorities’ and that ‘Murat Kurnaz's lawyer was told by the German Government that it was impossible to open negotiations with the US Government on his release because Murat Kurnaz was a Turkish citizen’ even though ‘all investigations had established, by as early as at the end of October 2002, that Murat Kurnaz posed no terrorist threat’. My colleagues and I are agreed that this gross misconduct on the part of the representatives of the former Social Democrat/Green Federal Government needs to be investigated.

Since January 2006, a great deal of work has been carried out by Parliament’s Temporary Committee, which is responsible for conducting investigations into the allegations made in the press on this sensitive issue. I should like to point out that, if its work is to be legitimate, it is important for the Committee to rely on tangible and verifiable evidence, so as to remain somewhat impartial. The MEPs are vested with a duty of transparency and information towards the citizens; this information must therefore be guided by a concern to provide the most accurate feedback possible. While the final report does not fulfil this demand as well as it might, I decided to vote in favour, convinced that, through these committees, Parliament is required to play a decisive role in terms of helping to ensure that the human rights and fundamental values to which the Union fully adheres in its Treaties are respected. Thus, the fight against terrorism must be waged in compliance with the international law in force, and no human rights violations can be justified.</p>

I should like, nevertheless, to emphasise that this solidarity, valued at EUR 45 million, is of an exceptional and limited nature and requires certain conditions. The granting of aid must be made subject to the fulfilment of objectives such as the increased transparency of public finances and respect for human rights.</p>

This would have a negative affect on farmers and rural communities in my constituency, who badly need these funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">The lack of funding for rural development is a problem for Wales. This has been caused by a combination of the UK not getting a fair share of the EU funding, the UK Government's defence of its budget rebate and the UK Presidency's financial perspectives deal. As a result of this failure by government, Ministers will look to modulation to top up this fund.</p>

In my constituency that would mean the National Assembly for Wales rather than at Member State level.

      <p sl="pt">As we have said before, the key issue here is that the Commission’s proposal is not a proposal for genuine modulation. Such a proposal would increase aid to those who receive the least, or receive nothing, and reduce aid to those who receive a large amount, so as to ensure greater fairness in the distribution of aid among producers, countries and crops and to support small and medium farmers and family farming.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We feel that the Commission should table a fresh proposal in order to create genuine, compulsory modulation, which would guarantee greater fairness and release financial resources by introducing a maximum limit to aid per holding (capping) and a percentage increase in aid for farmers who receive the least from the CAP (modulation), for example, by proposing a 15% to 20% increase for small or medium-sized farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 in aid, and taking various circumstances into account even when they receive more than that.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Without this, there is a risk that existing inequalities will be exacerbated. We therefore urge the Commission to recast the proposal in order to ensure that a decision on this issue does not ultimately lead to the renationalisation of the costs of the CAP. The Commission has so far not done this, however. Hence our decision to abstain.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The removal of aid for farmers would raise issues of competition between farmers from countries that do not employ modulation and those from countries that do, and between farmers in the latter category depending on the level of modulation decided upon.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We are faced with two alternatives in this vote: the Commission’s proposal and the proposal by the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. In this situation, we have chosen to vote in favour of the Commission’s proposal, since it is better than the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is quite absurd.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The report’s explanatory statement contains a whole range of views. For example, it criticises possible abandonment or renationalisation of the common agricultural policy – a development that the June List would find desirable – and complains that it is contrary to the European Parliament’s right of participation, a view that the June List does not share.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In addition, the explanatory statement maintains that the health check on the long-term budget should only form the basis of proposals for the financing period after 2013. The June List completely rejects that view. We believe that the mid-term review should lead to cuts in the agriculture/rural development budget as early as in the current budget period of 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The June List observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision regarding the EU’s agricultural policy.

      <p sl="fr">As much as twenty per cent of the funds may be transferred under voluntary modulation. The Member States may choose this modulation from an abridged menu, rather than from one imposed on them, which serves up 'direct aid' as a main course and 'rural development' as a dessert.</p>

      <p sl="en">The British Conservative Delegation recognises the vital importance of agri-environment schemes. However, for three major reasons, Conservatives voted in favour of rejecting the Commission’s proposal on voluntary modulation. Firstly, for British farmers, voluntary modulation would be anything but voluntary – they would be forced to accept a cut of up to 20 % of the value of their single farm payment, while the rest of Europe’s farmers would not. Had Tony Blair negotiated a better EU Budget deal for the UK on rural development monies, our farmers would not be facing this bleak prospect. Secondly, the proposal that we are called to vote on is, in any case, unacceptable to the British Government itself because it does not allow for regionalisation, it restricts the Government’s freedom in deciding spending priorities and it maintains a franchise unsuitable to the UK’s farming structure. Labour MEPs did not move a single amendment to bring the proposal more into line with their Government’s wishes! Finally, Commissioner Fischer Boel’s most recent statements suggest that Parliament’s overwhelming opposition to the proposal cannot be totally ignored and that some form of compromise may emerge.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, in point 34 of the resolution on climate change, which we have just voted on, the Commission was asked to assess the risks to nuclear institutions posed by floods and tsunamis that are caused by climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is a Finnish campaign behind this idea which is based on a fictional novel, and for which there is no scientific basis. In the story, a tsunami, brought about by climate change, causes an accident that results in massive damage to a nuclear power plant. I am in favour of exercising great caution and assessing the risks, but this initiative was annoying and downright embarrassing for the reputation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. First of all, climate change does not cause tsunamis. That idea is considered absurd by serious researchers. My colleagues behind the initiative are right to say that an assessment of the risks of power stations is always necessary, but wrong to let it be understood that this had not already been done. No power plant is built without ensuring that it is flood-resistant. That is why I am also forced to ask the Commission to assess the political risks arising from parliamentary initiatives based on pure fiction. I am happy that this time the problem was avoided.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We broadly welcome the adoption of this document, yet another on climate change. It is a document that asserts, or confirms, our undertakings as regards reducing emissions and promoting alternative energies. It does not, however, deal with other equally important points such as promoting energy efficiency and the use of high-quality public transport; these alternatives are covered either fleetingly or in watered-down form.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It also emphasises the proposal to commercialise emissions rights, or to put it more aptly, the ‘right to pollute’. As we have been saying, this would run counter to the stated objectives, on account of its commercial nature, as those who can pay will still be able to pollute. This will affect in particular countries with weaker economies that do not have the money to buy these emissions rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Whilst there are some welcome proposals in the areas of emissions reductions and renewable energy, there are other proposals that would be difficult to implement given the stringent requirements placed on the different countries, especially given the opposition to them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In any event, we shall carefully monitor the implementation of some of the ideas in the report, whilst fighting to ensure that they are not exploited for the purpose of further concentrating energy in the hands of the wealthiest countries or in such a way that it is the consumer who has to carry the can for the pollution costs of the polluting companies.</p>

The Minerva Strategy, which involves mobilising innovation in support of the national economy and developing scientific and educational activities, constitutes an implementation of the Lisbon Strategy that aims to make Slovakia one of the most advanced, modern and prosperous societies worldwide, and thereby possibly also a source of ideas and inspiration to other Members States of the Union.</p>

It also makes a point, however, of welcoming the Commission’s proposal to introduce a market-based approach to the spectrum and to establish a clear legal framework providing for competition-based solutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ultimately, despite its good intentions, it gives the green light to pursuing neoliberal policies and to worshipping at the altar of the market, which will jeopardise the provision of public services.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, international terrorism is the most dangerous threat to peace, security, human dignity and integrity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Being an invisible enemy, which is geographically diffuse, and which can be found inside and outside of our borders, it needs to be fought in a way that is different to the way the European Union has had to fight its enemies in the past.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union’s anti-terrorist strategy must be global, multilateral and based on the United Nations system. Any unilateral and exclusively military response is doomed to failure. The fight against terrorism will be won in the field of values. It is therefore crucial, in order to defeat terrorism morally, to increase the awareness of it and mobilise our public opinion. We must at no point lower our guard. We must not just react following a massive attack, but rather we should act in a permanent and proactive manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">A strengthened CFSP is vital to our success. This means making improvements, providing better resources and better coordination amongst European intelligence and information services and more work on uncovering terrorism’s funding channels.</p>
      <p sl="es">In its external actions, the Union must focus on stopping certain States providing support for terrorist groups, through coercive measures and sanctions, and it must help weak States to strengthen their institutions and their democracy in order to prevent them from harbouring terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, preserving the rule of law and human rights in the fight against terrorism is not just absolutely crucial for moral reasons. It is the raison d'etre of our strategy, because that is precisely what the terrorists want to destroy: the values on which our co-existence is based. If we give ground in this area, as in the case of the Iraq War, Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib or the illegal CIA flights, we will be providing the terrorists with excuses, which they will try to use as justification, and we will be fuelling their activities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Restricting fundamental rights does not create more security, but rather more fear. We need free societies that feel secure in themselves. Fearful societies have already lost the fight against terrorism. The security/freedom dilemma is a false one. We will be safer if we are freer, more open and more inclusive.</p>
      <p sl="es">Prevention, which is so important and which failed both on 11 September in New York and on 11 March in Madrid, is crucial, as is greater efficiency in police and judicial action. Our CFSP must contribute to eradicating the fertile ground upon which international terrorism thrives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Terrorism is never justifiable. We must never talk about causes, but rather the circumstances that feed it, the first of which is the humiliation and disdain suffered by millions of Muslims, which they perceive as arrogance on the part of the West, and the exacerbation of endemic conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another is the disrespectful treatment of a religion that is followed peacefully by more than 1 300 million people throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are dealing with fundamentalist fanatics, who are dogmatic, but not a particular religion or belief. We sometimes forget that there have been more Muslim victims of Islamist terrorism than Western victims. This explains the international success of initiatives such as the Alliance of Civilisations, adopted by the United Nations, in opposition to the clash of civilisations advocated by fundamentalists from one side or another.</p>
      <p sl="es">As well as better resources, international terrorism must be beaten by means of intelligence and tenacity, not by means of inflammatory speeches that only demonstrate fundamental weakness. Fascism, firstly, and then Stalinism, decades later, were defeated in the ideological field, without surrendering the principles that lie at the heart of our societies, including freedom of expression exercised in a responsible manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">My report places particular emphasis on recognising the victims as principal actors, to whom the public powers must listen. We therefore have four direct victims of the massive attack of 11 March in Madrid in the gallery. Jesús Ramírez Castanedo, Jesús Abril Escusa, Isabel Casanova Ortega and Euclides Antonio Río Grajales. I would like to thank them very much for being here.</p>

    <intervention id="3-241" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Gloser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I would like to thank your House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, and your rapporteur Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García, for the report on the external dimension of the fight against terrorism, which has been presented today. It is a comprehensive report and discusses a number of extremely important issues on which we are largely of one mind. The terrorist threat is now, more than ever, international in character, and the measures taken by the European Union to overcome it can, in fact, be successful only if they form part of a coordinated global effort at combating terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="de">At its meeting in December 2005, the European Council adopted an anti-terrorism strategy for the European Union in which the general outline of the European Union’s anti-terrorist measures is marked out, and, at the same meeting, adopted the European Union’s strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment for terrorist purposes, in both of which documents the external dimension of anti-terrorist activity is exhaustively discussed.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are three important points that I would like to highlight as regards terrorism’s external aspects, namely radicalisation and recruitment, cooperation with external partners and the international legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the principal object of the anti-terrorist strategy consists in preventing people from resorting to terrorism, and action must also be taken to deal with the factors that can help to radicalise people and make them susceptible to recruitment by terrorist organisations. In its foreign policy measures directed against terrorism, the EU has continued to endeavour to consider every possible issue connected with radicalisation and recruitment, and has shared with its external partners its experience and best practices in dealing with the problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has also broken new ground in including anti-radicalisation measures in a special technical aid programme for combating terrorism. Meetings featuring dialogue between religions and cultures have been held as part of the ASEM process and the Barcelona process, and under the auspices of the Anna Lindh Foundation; the EU has also set up working parties to discuss in depth how it might improve its public diplomacy and its contacts with Islam both within the EU and outside it, and we want to continue to move this forward in a determined manner. Radicalisation and recruitment will also continue to be addressed in future programmes of technical support in combating terrorism and will remain an important feature of the dialogue with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, there is cooperation with external partners, and, in pursuing its objectives in the field of anti-terrorism, we have continued to collaborate closely with partners outside the European Union. The political dialogue with partners is an essential component in the European Union’s foreign policy action against terrorism, and the status of respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while at the same time combating terrorism as key issues in it reminds me of the debate we had this morning, in which there was a high degree of unanimity.</p>
      <p sl="de">A considerable amount of work has been done with a number of countries in order to improve cooperation in the fight against terrorism. The European Union and the Member States have agreed to provide technical anti-terrorist support to certain countries that are to be regarded as high-priority cases, and progress has been made in political consultations with others of their kind. The European Union has also helped to build up capacity at regional level, for example, at the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC) in Indonesia and the African Union’s anti-terrorism centre in Algiers.</p>
      <p sl="de">We continue to attach high priority to anti-terrorist cooperation with the United States. Politicians and experts from the European Union and the USA have worked together on intensifying their dialogue, and the EU has extended its dialogue on anti-terrorism issues to include other partner countries such as Israel, Australia, Canada and Russia, as well as those that participate with it in the Europe-Mediterranean Partnership, in considering areas of common interest and options for cooperation, notably the provision of technical assistance to other countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, in the international legal framework, the European Union has continued to press for a key role to be given to the United Nations in the combating of terrorism. Since the adoption of a comprehensive agreement on international terrorism, including a clear and unambiguous definition of it in all its forms and manifestations, would indeed send an important signal and would show the international community taking determined action to counter the terrorist threat, the European Union will continue to make every effort to reach international consensus on one.</p>
      <p sl="de">The recent adoption of a United Nations strategy, with the aim of stepping up international cooperation with third countries in combating terrorism also represents an important advance, and the European Union is prepared to join with all other states belonging to the United Nations in implementing it; this is one of its priorities for the future, and it intends to make use of its dialogue with external partners to press for the implementation of this strategy across the board, as also for an exchange of ideas as to how this goal might best be achieved. I believe that your House would, by bringing this issue to the attention of your partners in dialogue in third countries, be making a supremely valuable contribution to achieving that goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the institutions of the European Union are largely agreed on the priorities for combating international terrorism. I can tell your rapporteur that his report and a long-term exchange of views such as that in which we are currently engaged help to deepen our shared understanding and help us to devise suitable measures to combat international terrorism. It would also send a message to those who have been the victims of terrorist atrocities.</p>

    <intervention id="3-242" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Benita Ferrero-Waldner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García, for his report. Let there be no doubt: terrorism is a threat to all states and to all peoples. It is criminal and it is unjustifiable under any circumstances. The Commission therefore fully shares the view of the report that terrorism constitutes an important threat to security, to peace, stability and the democratic values on which the European Union is founded.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also shares the objective of combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights. All anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with both international humanitarian law and international human rights law.</p>
      <p sl="en">While largely agreeing with the report, I would like to comment on two points. Firstly, the report is calling for the adoption of a definition of terrorism. Since the UN has not yet agreed on a definition and since such an agreement still seems distant, although we are working towards that, I would like to recall that relevant universal conventions and protocols already provide a common legal understanding of what constitutes an act of terrorism. The Union also has a definition of terrorist acts in its framework decision on terrorism. These are solid legal foundations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the report calls for the extension of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity. I think we should be cautious, before altering the definition of crimes against humanity included in the ICC Statute. Such an endeavour might be counter-productive in the efforts to broaden support for the Court. The complex relationship between international humanitarian law and the definition of terrorism may lead to further complications.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the interest of the Parliament on the external aspects of the fight against terrorism. In the current environment of open borders, efforts to fight against terrorism, internally and externally, are aspects that are closely linked. It goes without saying that Vice-President Frattini and I are working closely together in order to make these efforts mutually reinforcing. We strongly agree on the need to support the United Nations consistently with our policy of effective multilateralism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, the emphasis put on prevention is very important for the Commission. Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism need to be tackled. Tackling the root causes of terrorism lies at the heart of our external policies, and the report’s recommendations for a more coherent and effective EU policy also largely go in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me highlight the important contribution that the Commission makes to the fight against terrorism. Firstly, with Member States, the Commission is implementing the 2005 EU counter-terrorism strategy, of which our colleague and President has talked. Terrorism also features regularly during meetings with our partners and in international organisations. For example, as I speak, a major meeting is under way with Commission participation in Berlin in order to prepare the Heiligendamm Summit of the G8 in the areas of terrorism and organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the Commission is an important provider of capacity-building assistance to some 80 third countries aimed at improving governance and administrative capacities in related areas. A number of priority fields mentioned in the report, such as border management and terrorist financing, are priorities for Community assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the Commission is working in new areas which should improve EU action in the fight against terrorism, such as the protection of critical infrastructure, the fight against violent radicalisation and terrorist recruitment, bioterrorism, radiological threats, explosive detection technologies, terrorist use of the internet, as well as terrorism in the context of crisis management, and there are obvious links to our efforts in fighting organised crime and drug trafficking. Afghanistan is, for instance, a serious case in point.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, and in reply to one of the requests of this report, the Commission wishes to confirm that it intends to produce a communication in the course of 2007 focusing on global and trans-regional security challenges. The focus will include key aspects relevant to human security and focus on counter-terrorism. You may be aware of my personal commitment to support the human security discourse. What better way could there be to address conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism than to promote both freedom from fear and freedom from want.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite what is being done, I think we can all agree that we must work together and enhance our collective performance in fighting against terrorism. We will try to play our part, but we are certain that the collective effort with Parliament will be a more important one.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the task, on behalf of the Committee on Development, of drafting an opinion on this report on the external dimension of the fight against terrorism, which was drafted by my colleague, Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can only talk about this issue by adopting an approach that encompasses our development policies, for the benefit of the countries of the South, in particular. As uncompromising as it certainly is, this opinion highlights a series of crucial points, which have already been addressed in this House, concerning the very definition of terrorism, respect for human rights and relations with the various migrant populations of Europe, in particular. This opinion also deals with the issue of the difficult coexistence between the fight against terrorism and the need to safeguard respect for human rights in all circumstances, so that no one can justify the denial of the one for the sake of the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our report then goes on to raise the issue of the fight against terrorism from the perspective of the repercussions that its funding methods may have on the quality and effectiveness of European development cooperation. Thus, we highlight, for example, the fact that, currently, a large number of measures adopted by the Member States that do not come directly under a policy for reducing poverty in the countries of the South have sadly been included in official development aid. These include, for example, the funding of military investments, the repatriation of illegal immigrants, some immigration policy-related expenditure, and I could go on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Committee on Development also wishes to draw our Parliament's attention to the fact that, by including in official development aid financial support for a range of activities connected with the fight against terrorism, we will merely be further compromising its main objective, which is to eradicate poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This opinion was adopted by nearly all of the members of the Committee on Development, on 6 November. However, the majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs sadly did not think it worthwhile to adopt any of the paragraphs in this opinion. That is why we have decided to re-introduce the main thrusts of this text, in the form of amendments to the report, and I therefore call on all of the democratic groups to endorse them so that, alongside the necessary fight against terrorism, we can carry out effective development policies aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which represent the real long-term – even very long-term – solution to terrorism and to all the suffering that it leaves in its disastrous wake.</p>

      <p sl="es">The fight against terrorism is a priority that requires solidarity from all of the Member States and commitment from the democratic countries. Security is a genuine fundamental right that cannot be exercised at any expense, but in strict accordance with the law and respect for human rights. International terrorism threatens human rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="es">The sinister distinction between murdering terrorists and political terrorists, between armed wings and political wings, only makes the whole thing even more criminal to the detriment of the law. To hold dialogue of any kind with terrorists is unfair, pointless and offensive to the victims.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Member States must pay particular attention to promoting intercultural relations and enhancing inter-religious dialogue amongst the members of civil society, with a view to improving co-existence, tolerance and mutual understanding.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Union must rationalise, coordinate and facilitate the actions of its instruments, Europol, Eurojust, Cepol and the Situation Centre, and others pursuing the same aims, in order to detect and prevent links between terrorism and other forms of crime.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would ask, Madam President, when drawing up prevention strategies, that the horrendous experiences of the victims be respected and taken into account in particular, as I say in my report. The victims must be acknowledged and protected. Terrorists begin to lose when the victims make the truth of their experiences known and society listens to them.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to prevention, Madam President, prevention cannot and must not be used as a missile amongst democratic countries and States. The last time prevention failed was on 30 December 2006 in Madrid. We do not criticise failures in prevention. We work hard to ensure that they never happen again.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall draw to a close, Madam President. We will only be able to tackle terrorism with determination when all of the democratic countries, together, and the Union in the singular, have a clear view of the threat, and the threat is lethal, permanent and destined to remain with us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating you, Madam President, on your office as Vice-President, in which capacity you represent the region of Eastern Westphalia-Lippe, from which we both come, and that is cause for pride.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and point out that terrorism is a cross-border phenomenon. We will succeed in countering it only if cross-border cooperation is in place within the European Union and with the states and organisations outside it. Putting this in place is often a slow business, particularly if we consider the internal policy aspect of our shared security problem, which is still arranged between the states, and that is why implementing the positions of the individual Member States can sometimes be very laborious. That is evidence of the fact that, if we want to be more secure against terrorism and organised crime, we need the European Constitution as a more effective means of making obligations in the common sphere more binding and improving the decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Along with close cooperation between the security bodies, it is also urgently necessary that the causes of terrorism be addressed. There may be no justification for terrorism, but it does have its causes, to which we have to give our attention, and I see political, economic and social issues as being of great significance here. There must also be no more token gestures of a certain kind. If it were to be possible, for a joint effort, for example by way of the Quartet, to resolve the Middle East issue, that would take much of the wind out of terrorism’s sails. I cite that as only one example of the interconnections that exist in this area. Something that is apparent from the report, and that I find most especially important, is the need for us to make use of inter-cultural dialogue. We have to make it clear to people in the other regions of the world, too, that we value their culture, their religion, and their development as equal to our own, if such causes of dissension are not to arise from feelings of cultural inferiority. That is a particular duty. All these things have to be done in accordance with the rule of law and with respect for our values, for, if we surrender the latter, the other side will have won, and that is why we have to take our values and the rule of law as our shield.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, terrorist acts are always criminal, but terrorism is also always a political project. I think its current manifestation aims to subvert the humanitarian values of equality, whether it be between gender, religion or nationality. It also seeks to undermine civil rights – the civil rights of a plural democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we have to be very careful in expressing those values. If we choose to call them ‘our’ values rather than treating them as universal values, I think we will fall into the trap of the ‘clash of civilisations’. Our best defence of those values, therefore, has to be primarily political. We must demonstrate the strength of those values by ensuring freedom and quality of life for all in Europe and globally.</p>
      <p sl="en">Security measures certainly have to be applied: the collection of intelligence, the prosecution of lawbreakers and, indeed, the prevention and prosecution of incitement to hatred and violence. But the Fava report, which we spent a long time discussing this morning, indicates what can go badly wrong if we are not extremely careful. We have to avoid simplistic analysis. We have to avoid the assumption that every political or religious fundamentalist is a terrorist – that is simply not true, and I think it is important that we bear that in mind. I know lots of fundamentalist Catholics who would be appalled at the idea that anybody would commit a terrorist act in their name.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would appeal for deeper analysis than we are currently getting, and caution about the language we are using. I would argue that, if we are going to be successful, we have to deal with inequalities on our continent, but also inequalities globally as well.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against global manifestations of terrorism is a decisive test of democratic Europe’s capacity to act. In order to pre-empt and prevent brutal acts of terrorism, the special services must be able to make use of the most effective preventive and repressive methods, and this is unthinkable without international cooperation. The report by Mr Fava contains a lot of criticism of the United States, but we must realise that we need even closer cooperation between the European Union and the USA as compared with that to date, that it is necessary for the USA and Europe to take united common action against the ideological causes of terrorism, and that we need a closer exchange of information, based on mutual trust. The European Parliament and the members of the national parliaments of the Member States also need to be involved in a more focused and professional way in the drafting and implementation of the general strategy on terrorism, and active cooperation between the Member States’ services must be fostered. In carrying out parliamentary supervision, we must ensure greater professionalism and political responsibility, especially when monitoring the lawfulness of the methods used in counter-terrorism measures.</p>

      <p sl="es">Firstly, I would like to welcome Mr Yañez-Barnuevo's efforts to tackle an issue which is complex and which is often subject to debates that have more to do with party politics than the fundamental issues. But above all I would like to thank him for showing great sensitivity towards at least three of the issues that our group considers to be important.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first has also been mentioned by the Commissioner, and relates to the problem of the definition. The first significant problem facing us is the fact that it will be difficult for the European Union to combat terrorism in a consistent and credible fashion unless we have a definition. Although it is true that there are many, shall we say, differing opinions on this matter, we would like to make a concrete proposal, and that is to work on the basis of the proposal which was presented and approved within the United Nations on the proposal of the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in turn on the proposal of the High-Level Group. We therefore already have certain significant proposals on the table on which to base our work.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second element of concern to us, of course, relates to the fact that the supposed fight against terrorism is often used to justify wars, massacres and torture. We saw that this morning when we discussed the Fava report, and elsewhere. That is what cannot be allowed to happen. We therefore also applaud, welcome and support the proposal to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity within the context of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, so that that Court can deal with them as well.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, another issue that we believe to be important is that, with regard to the existence of anti-terrorist lists, which have often proven to be counterproductive for certain peace processes in the world, it is also necessary to bear in mind that the current situation, on the one hand, sometimes leads to arbitrary detentions, and on the other, it hinders the efforts being made by the European Union in situations such as the Middle East, Sri Lanka, etc. Therefore, the issue of anti-terrorist lists should also at least be revised and studied, on the basis of what has been approved by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I have to say, Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García, that your speech was markedly better than your report, a certain amount of material in which was, I am aware, whispered in your ear, and it is regrettable that the Committee on Development's opinion was not also adopted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Terrorism, of any kind, is utterly unacceptable, but it is unfortunate that the report provides us with no concrete definition of what terrorism is, although it always talks in terms of ‘international terrorism’. There exists the widest possible variety of groups, which, for the most diverse reasons, believe that they have to commit terrorist acts. We have to consider each of them individually and establish just why they come to the erroneous conclusion that terrorist acts are necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">It also appears to me that whole subjects have been left out completely – state-sponsored terrorism, for example. What about France’s past attack on the Greenpeace ship? As a number of Members have already said, we have to address the causes of terrorism. At the moment, the Western states are engaged in a war on terror – in Afghanistan and Iraq – that is proving to be completely counter-productive, for while this war is being waged, terrorism is on the increase rather than declining.</p>
      <p sl="de">We read in the report that measures are to be made more stringent in all manner of ways, and that fundamental rights are to be more and more eroded, and it is for that reason that we cannot endorse it. We have therefore submitted a minority report on the subject.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the rapporteur is absolutely right to mention the medium of the high-speed and global Internet as being part of the phenomenon of international terrorism, but he does so in a paradoxical fashion. While paragraph 12 appeals to the European Union to fight the misuse of the Internet for terrorist purposes, in paragraph 17, the rapporteur highlights the scope the Internet offers to trace, and thus resist, this self-same evil. At the moment, the growing number of Islamic terror websites are already demanding our urgent attention, for these form the virtual recruitment and training grounds of young Jihadists in Europe. Allow me to quote the European intelligence service: ‘these days, it is possible to become a terrorist simply by the information on the Internet’. Indeed, no more than a simple mouse-click is enough. This terrifying reality demands an intensive and cohesive European approach, and, mark my words, both internally and externally. Hence my request to the Commission and Council to provide this House with more factual information, given the intense threat emanating from terrorist websites, of which it is estimated that there are already some 4 500 Internet pages, in an attempt to trace them and indeed, to fight them in an effective manner and at European level.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, when this House discusses the fight against terrorism, there is the risk of us promptly falling back on politically correct commonplaces which hamper effective policy, or even make it impossible. As the report rightly suggests, international terrorism currently represents the biggest threat to peace and stability in open societies, and the most direct threat to freedom, security and human dignity. International terrorism has declared war on the whole of the western world, and that includes Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is therefore of the utmost importance for us to clearly identify this threat. When I read in recital A of the report words such as ‘international terrorism and the associated ideology’, then I fear that we are going the wrong way. Terrorism is not an ideology in itself, and neither is it a goal in itself. As the chairman of the Arab television station al-Arabiya asserted a few years ago, it is a painful reality that these days, although not all Muslims are terrorists, all terrorists are Muslim. It is a witticism which, like all witticisms, contains a grain of truth. It is fashionable in Europe to say that we do not want a Clash of Civilisations, but whether we like it or not, this Clash of Civilisations is in full swing. We must continue to fight poverty, and, of course, give our support, but we should not be naïve in thinking that this will also fully address terrorism. The perpetrators of the attacks in New York, London and Madrid were not poor; quite on the contrary, they were middle-class and highly educated. It would therefore be in the EU’s interest to introduce democratic ideas, including the free expression of opinion, into the Islamic world. What should really be established over there on a big scale is a kind of Radio Freedom .</p>
      <p sl="nl">Is this a plea to stigmatise all Muslims? Not at all. What is important, though, is that within Islam, such things as self-criticism and introspection should be promoted. A few weeks ago, it turned out that the chairman of the Muslim Executive in Belgium – this is the official government body, funded and recognised by the government – had given money to a convicted terrorist who is held in a Belgian jail. This is bad enough as it is. What I find worse, though, is that there was no reaction whatsoever to this incident from the Muslim quarters in Belgium. Quite the reverse; the resulting silence gave the impression that, at the least, people in those quarters were not at all shocked that the Chairman of the Muslim Executive, who claims to speak on behalf of all Muslims in Belgium, should give indirect support to terrorism. This is disquieting and we should challenge it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, terrorism is irredeemably evil. Its wicked persona is not to be excused or ameliorated. Sadly, the GUE/NGL minority report tries to do exactly that, with its focus on the economic and social causes of terrorism, its attack on the war on terror and its diversionary reference to what it calls ‘state terrorism’. I am not surprised, because embedded in GUE/NGL is Sinn Féin, the long-term friend and political affiliate of terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have heard much talk of human rights, as if fighting terrorism and a belief in human rights were incompatible. Remember that terrorists are those who set out to destroy all tenets of liberal democracy, who refuse to live by our civilised laws, but who are adept at exploiting them when it suits their nefarious purposes. Coming from Northern Ireland, I have seen that at first hand.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sometimes, if society is to survive, it must fight back. Some, I fear, would so cloak themselves in an exaggerated human rights mantra that they would see society perish sooner than terror.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a world of harsh choices. Rabid Islamic terrorism is a particular threat to every liberty that the Western world holds dear. It plays not by the rules, but embraces a perverted death culture that rejoices in mass murder. With such people we cannot be soft. If we are, they will win. Yes, there must be a winner between good and evil, between terror and order, and it is the duty of all of us to see that good triumphs and terror is vanquished.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, This is a very important report with different emphases.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the big problems seems to be that numerous states have not been willing to counter the terrorist threat efficiently. As you mentioned, Madam Commissioner, even several UN member states have not been able to agree on an international definition of terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this background I think the main challenge for us is to strengthen and enhance the efficiency of transatlantic cooperation and coordination. That also means fully implementing the EU-US cooperation declarations. I wonder whether concentrating on suspicions and accusations might give the misleading impression that US intelligence is not our ally but the main adversary.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, I would like to pay tribute to our own anti-terrorist efforts. They have succeeded in preventing many new terrorist attacks in the UK, Germany and the United States. But the urgent need is obviously for closer cooperation between the EU Member States and special agencies. I can only support the idea that the EU anti-terrorist coordinator be given a stronger mandate and more resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think paragraph 9 is especially relevant. It states that one of the EU’s external actions should be aimed at preventing extremist groups and states from resorting to terrorism. I think this is a key to practical solutions. Without the support of such states as Iran, terrorist initiatives will be dramatically reduced.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to begin my speech by congratulating Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García on his outstanding report. The positive aspect of this report is, to my mind, the balance it achieves between the need, on the one hand, for a firm, uncompromising approach coupled with more effective international coordination in the fight against terrorism, and on the other hand, the need to maintain human and civil rights and the principle of the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The report also takes account of factors contributing to the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists, be they outside or actually within Europe. Among these factors are extreme poverty, lack of access to education, social, economic, ethnic and religious discrimination and collective disenchantment. I firmly believe that the gradual elimination of these factors and causes is a vitally important prerequisite for successfully combating terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should also like, in conclusion, to urge, through the Council, those EU Member States that have not yet done so, to sign or ratify at the earliest opportunity the 16 United Nations universal instruments on combating terrorism. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating the violated rights of our esteemed terrorists this morning, Parliament was packed full, with the Commission Presidency and all the European institutions’ authorities. Now, however, when it is time to debate and take stock of the strategy for combating terrorism and, above all, for protecting Europe’s citizens against the looming threat of terrorism, few of the people involved are present. One day, somebody will write the story of Europe’s fight against terrorism and they will pick on this, together with the serious mistake we made this morning in adopting the Fava report, which is a huge gift to al-Qa’ida.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report rightly states that we need to examine the factors contributing to radicalisation. We know what these factors are: they are the mosques and Islamic centres. It is the absolute freedom granted to thousands of Islamic centres and mosques to carry out propaganda and recruitment and to collaborate actively with Islamic terrorist organisations. It is time we started to say that quite plainly here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this report starts from the false premise that international terrorism constitutes the greatest threat to the democratic international community. Likewise, President Bush’s concept of a war on terror is mistaken.</p>
      <p sl="en">Violence and terrorism are only means to an end. The greatest threat to the free democratic world comes from an ideology. The ideology in question is that of the fundamentalist and extremist Islam, which by means of terror seeks first to impose its psychological, and then ultimately its physical dominion on the world. They believe that time and demography are on their side and they have declared war on us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sun Tzu remarked that the first place to win a war is in the mind of the enemy. Islamic fundamentalists might conclude that they are well on the road to winning that war when its victims do not confront the fundamental cause of the problem. The solution is not for the European Union to concentrate more power in its hands, as is predictably recommended in this report. The solution is to recognise that fundamentalist, extremist and literal Islam is incompatible with Western liberal democracy and indeed any kind of civilisation. From that starting point we can begin to adopt concrete measures to combat its manifestations through the actions of nation states and international cooperation. Had I longer than 90 seconds to speak, I could have told you what some of those measures might be.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by extending my own solidarity to the victims of the Madrid bombings with us today.</p>
      <p sl="en">In debating international action to combat terrorism, let us recognise that such solidarity extends internationally and that the countries of the Middle East, Africa and Asia have suffered far more from terrorism over the past decade than we have in Europe or the West.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is right to seek international cooperation, as terrorists themselves exploit globalisation through the internet, mobile communications, the media and the covert movement of people and of funds. Europe should consistently use its foreign policies to encourage all third countries to sign, ratify and implement the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we must be consistent too in insisting that we cannot protect the rights and liberties of our own citizens by denying those of others beyond our borders. Our commitment must be to address the underlying conditions that draw people into terrorism, by working to improve respect for human rights, to promote democracy and good governance, to resolve conflict and to tackle world poverty and to roundly reject those, like the last speaker, who falsely seek to equate terrorism with religion by upholding our commitment to promote mutual understanding and cultural awareness in Europe and throughout the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the reason why I omitted to congratulate you is that I was not in fact thinking of the great region of Westphalia-Lippe, which Mr Brok, too, calls home.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, for this exchange of views. In any debate of this kind, there will of course – how could it be otherwise? – be differences and divergent views, but there is also agreement, and many of you made reference to this morning's debate, in which, too, there were of course considerable differences of opinion, yet unanimity prevailed when it came to the question of how to combat international terrorism while also maintaining our common values.</p>
      <p sl="de">A society such as our own is pluralistic and open. The public’s right to security is, of course, one of the fundamental freedoms, but how can that security be guaranteed? Although this is an area that can, perhaps, be regulated only by the Member States, it is becoming more and more apparent – as a number of your Members have indicated – that there is a need for coordination, that is to say, for cooperation across borders, which also includes cross-border cooperation between Europe and the United States.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we are to talk today about the causes of terrorism, it might be said that there is a holistic and long-term approach to it. One of your Members warned that perhaps the wrong measures might be taken under the heading of ‘prevention’, which I see as a very important consideration.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to go back to the example of last November’s Tripoli conference between the African Union and the European Union on the subject of migration. How we handle ‘good governance’ in these countries and give their peoples the prospect of education and work, are major issues. Do they actually have any prospects at all? Or are they the potential victims of those whose promises to them ultimately result in their deaths? This I see as something from which the European Union cannot avert its gaze. As in many other areas, there was vigorous debate among us a number of years ago concerning the European security strategy, when we came to agree that the fight against international terrorism is essential, but also that it called for a highly graduated range of instruments, one of which is prevention.</p>
      <p sl="de">None of these measures, however, can be activated at the press of a button, and they cannot be put into effect overnight. Doing so will demand staying power and proper coordination.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would now like to follow up a number of things that both the Commission and I – in my introductory remarks – mentioned, one of which has to do with the importance of establishing what role the United Nations is to play in this. What else can we do? I think it is important that Members of your House – not alone, but with others – should continue a dialogue on this subject with your counterparts in other regions that may perhaps also be suffering from terrorism. In saying this, I am thinking back to the establishment of the Europe-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, where one important approach might be to discuss these issues and arrive at an agreement on how to institute coordination and cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me, once more, sound a note of warning against simplistic answers and quick fixes. What is needed within the European Union is preparation for the long haul and a coordinated approach.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think this report and the debate on its adoption confirm the importance of the fight against terrorism not only for the Member States, but also for the European Union as a whole. It also demonstrates that respect for human rights has to remain the core of our counter-terrorism policies. I think our colleague is right: it has to be with patience, but also with persistence, that we fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make just a few comments. First, on the question of security and development, I said that I personally have always clung to the system of human security. Why? Because I think there is no development without security and no security without development. Therefore, freedom from fear – i.e. security for citizens – and freedom from want – i.e. prosperity rather than poverty – have to be our goal and, therefore, this is as much as a development issue as it is a foreign policy issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, I would also like to speak about the victims of terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="es">I welcome the victims of terrorism who are here with us.</p>
      <p sl="es">Victims of terrorism require our full attention, and the ways to assist them are under discussion in a number of international fora. The Commission will also follow these discussions with the greatest interest. Furthermore, assistance to victims of terrorism is provided through a number of financial programmes run by the services of Vice-President Frattini, and also by ourselves: for instance, in Colombia, where we are working hard on the reinsertion of former soldiers of the different terrorist organisations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Dialogue between cultures and civilisations is also highly important, and I cannot agree that this should be restricted to extremist and fundamentalist Islamists. They exist, but there are also other terrorists. Therefore, please let us not restrict the debate to this group alone: it is much broader, and it is very important that we not only respect different religions and civilisations, but also that we work with each other, talk to each other and have an ongoing dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="es">I should also like to say a word on the issue of the Internet, which is one of the important areas under discussion in the G8, in the Rome/Lyons Group. There are a lot of complexities, since important aspects – for instance, freedom of the press – are involved, not least in the United States. What is involved? Sharing knowledge, helping to understand terrorists, the use of the Internet for radicalisation and recruitment, for propaganda and fund-raising, sharing best practices, how we can work against it on a voluntary basis, fine methodologies, etc. I just wanted to say to Mr Belder that there is quite a lot going on.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, it is in this spirit that the Commission will also examine the very important remarks and recommendations that have been made and are included in this report. The overall objective remains to improve the efficiency and coherence of our collective efforts, and I think cooperation between the three institutions will be key to success in the long run.</p>

      <p sl="en">International terrorism is like a deadly disease. We often see it as someone else’s misfortune until it strikes home.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ultimately, however, in a direct or indirect way all countries, and even institutions, are drawn into the cauldron.</p>
      <p sl="en">Terrorism knows no borders and is indiscriminate. One has only to review the names of those who died in 9/11 to realise that the victims derived from so many different countries and adhered to all the major religions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can we talk, however, of a war on terror? In war your enemies are known. In terrorist scenarios these are unknown. A main topic of public international law is the Laws of War. This is completely alien when dealing with terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="en">However we have managed to produce some form of legal approach in combating terrorism. One of the more meaningful documents was adopted in Barcelona having regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism. The participating countries made no less than 21 obligations to fight terrorism. Perhaps this should act as a blueprint and if these obligations are adhered to at least one region will be earnestly addressing this calamity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mrs Esteves, and the rapporteurs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Pinior and Mr Vatanen, for their reports on visa facilitation and readmission agreements. They reflect the European Parliament’s concerns and the advice to which the Commission will pay great attention in monitoring the implementation of the two agreements. I wish to confirm the joint Council-Commission statement that was just heard by you, that Vice-President Frattini and I have addressed to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the request of its chairman, Mr Cavada.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would not underestimate the concerns the European Union has over the human rights situation in Russia. We remain worried about the shortcomings regarding in particular the rule of law and media freedom in Russia. I understand and share the concerns raised by the European Parliament in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has always looked to the European Parliament as an ally in its promotion of the principles of democracy and the universality of human rights in our relations with partner countries such as Russia. For their own sake, but also because they are cornerstones of peace and human development, they are indeed agreed common values and the foundations of the long-term strategic partnership which the European Union wants to have with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the beginning, the Commission has been and will continue to emphasise to the Russian authorities that our strategic partnership is based on common values which underpin EU-Russia relations as enshrined in the partnership and cooperation agreement and in the four Common Spaces roadmaps. They explicitly foresee the strengthening of our cooperation through respect of individual rights in the EU Member States and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The readmission agreement fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms and is consistent with the EU’s human rights policies. Article 18 of the agreement explicitly clarifies that it is without prejudice to the rights, obligations and responsibilities of the Community, the Member States and the Russian Federation arising from international law, in particular from the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The practical implementation of the readmission agreement will fall under the exclusive competence of the Member States and Russia’s national authorities. All of those authorities are directly bound by the above-mentioned international instruments and their individual return decisions are subject to judicial review before national courts.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as asylum seekers are concerned, I would like to clarify that they are not included in the scope of the readmission agreement. They have for the duration of their asylum procedure a temporary right to stay in the territory of Member States. The agreement covers only illegal immigrants, that means people who do not or no longer fulfil the conditions in force for entry to, presence in, or residence in the territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has in particular to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article 18 of the Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, the extension of our common borders after the EU enlargement has of course broadened the scope of our cooperation with Russia. Russia is, and should be, a strategic partner and an important neighbour to the European Union. Now migration policy and movement of people have become strategic priorities for the EU’s external relations in general and with Russia in particular. I firmly believe that only by engaging with Russia can we achieve real results in those areas of common concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through visa facilitation, we are decisively contributing to the common objective of building a new Europe without dividing lines and facilitating travel among our citizens. We are fostering trust and dialogue. People-to-people contacts are intensifying and our economic and societal interaction is increasing to the benefit of all our citizens. Through readmission we are effectively fighting illegal migration, contributing to joint migration management.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the first agreement on visa facilitation ever negotiated by the Community and the first readmission agreement concluded with a major partner country are tangible signs of our practical cooperation within the aforementioned common space on freedom, security and justice. They are evidence of our resolve to successfully address common challenges with Russia. They will remain, I think, as landmark, sectoral agreements within the overall new architecture provided by the strategic agreement on which we hope to launch negotiations with Russia soon.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament debated the agreements on facilitating visas and the readmission of illegal immigrants concluded between the EU and the Russian Federation. With the active intervention of most of the committee members and with the special help of Mr Lax, Mr Vatanen and Mrs Roure, whom I wish to thank, the debate was far from routine. It was a troubled debate because the Russian Federation’s political landscape, and its difficult relationship with democracy and human rights, was never far from people's thoughts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, Parliament was only consulted when it was no longer possible to influence the content of the agreements. The Commission and the Council need to bring these agreements to us at an earlier stage, as part of the institutional cooperation laid down in the Treaties. We know that the still intergovernmental nature of the Union’s external policy does not accord us all of the powers of a true Parliament. The day will come when it does, once the European Constitution crisis is over.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The wording of the agreements, and the political landscape surrounding them, raises a number of questions for Parliament to address. The agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas does not guarantee genuine reciprocity between the EU and the Russian Federation, either with its wording or in terms of the way in which events are predicted to happen. Obtaining visas in the Russian Federation is a dreadfully complex process: mandatory registration on every journey within Russia, surcharges, additional permits, in particular for travel to Chechnya and certain parts of Eastern Russia, invitations for admission, which are conducive to corruption, bureaucratic obstacles; in short, one hurdle after another. As we all know, simplifying visas in Russia involves a veil of uncertainty. What Parliament would like and expects to see is strong commitment on the part of the Commission and the Council to lobby the Russian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In spite of all the difficulties, Parliament welcomes the spirit of openness that the visa facilitation arrangements will bring to relations between our peoples. It is the kind of openness needed for a new Europe, for a broader Europe, for that justice on a broad scale that we all want to build. The agreements on the readmission of immigrants also aroused passionate debate in the Committee on Civil Liberties. We rejected the simplistic and dangerous classification of this agreement as being a merely technical agreement; an agreement dealing with people is, by definition, never technical, and this is particularly true of those on illegal immigrants, which brings to life the human misery of poverty and social exclusion. The misfortune of some affects us all. If there is one area in which guarantees of human rights can be vulnerable it is precisely in this area of immigration.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament is concerned precisely about the guarantees of human rights in the accelerated readmission procedure and about respect for the status in international law of asylum seekers and stateless persons. The speed of the procedure is not a value; people's dignity throughout the process is a value, which must be characterised by rights during the ordeal of illegal immigration, namely the right to defence, humane treatment in detention, family unity, and physical and psychological inviolability. This is why the Joint Readmission Committee, which the agreement mentions, must include a human rights monitoring component, by which I mean active monitoring, because this is Europe's identity – it is what defines Europe. Human rights are the only criterion by which compliance with the agreements and the good faith of the parties can be measured.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a political act is always conditioned by circumstances, and in this case the circumstance is the EU looking for its own energy and a Russian Federation stubbornly refusing to sign essential declarations on human rights. Yet the Union’s silence on this matter would be tantamount to a negation of its culture of rights. The Union must not silence this culture. In any part of the world, realpolitik must not endlessly challenge our ideals. A joint compromise declaration by the Council and the Commission, such as the one that is promised and that accompanies Parliament’s decision, is the most important step that we have taken today. Is it a small step or giant leap? The answer lies with the ethical conscience of the main players – only time will tell.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I was expecting to have less time to speak, so now I shall give more time to the other speakers.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we examine objectively the Agreement we have reached, there is no denying that it is a step in the right direction, albeit a very modest one. We have to remember that the original proposal was very modest in scope. One of the three main things that still cause difficulties for travellers in Russia is the registration requirement. How can travellers today still be required to register with the police at different places? In practice, this completely prevents normal motoring in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Russian Federation recently introduced a law which prevents undesirable persons from entering Russia. What criteria are being used, though? Is entry into Russia denied to those who have found fault with Russia, the Kremlin, Putin or his speech at Munich? Are these the criteria used to make someone an undesirable person in Russia? There are regions in Russia, such as Chechnya and other areas, where travellers cannot even go.</p>
      <p sl="fi">What is hard to take in this whole situation is the fact that this reflects the relationship between the EU and Russia. It shows how we are unable to resolve problems on an equal footing. The Commission spoke fine words about common values, but where are they exactly? If we had common values, we would also be able to conclude balanced agreements that served the interests of both sides and our common future. If we accept such one-sided agreements as this one, we will actually slow down Russia’s transition to the rule of law. In this Agreement there are echoes of a time gone by, and if we take an honest look at our partnership and its development, we will need to start drawing up a new agreement immediately.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I was the author of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Council’s decision concerning the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation on readmission. The Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomed the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation on readmission, in parallel to the visa facilitation agreement. This represents a further step toward completing the creation of an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, within the framework of the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Committee on Foreign Affairs also believes that it is necessary to enhance the capacity of the Russian Federation in the field of migration management, in order for its authorities to be able to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the readmission agreement, as soon as this agreement enters into force. The committee was also concerned about the absence of regulatory framework provisions for implementing the Agreement. The European Commission should seek to provide the Russian authorities with the necessary expertise in order for the country to be in a position to meet its obligations according to accepted international standards. That is the most important matter to be dealt with at present.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to talk about the readmission agreement between the European Union and Russia; although in fact, both agreements – on readmission and on simplification of the issuing procedures of short term visas – are being considered together.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Relations between the European Union and Russia cover an increasing number of areas. If we want these relations to be truly successful, it is necessary for them to be dominated by values, not just technical aspects. Only in this way will we be able to achieve the goal of creating a more open Europe, which respects basic values and is able to change the world in a positive way.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In my opinion, the basic problem relating to the readmission agreement between the European Union and Russia is that it is unclear whether the primary focus is human rights or whether priority is being given to a generalised approach to refoulement of individuals, that is, priority is given to security considerations rather than to humanitarian aspects. I fully understand that when readmission agreements are being drafted, the temptation to equate illegal migration with criminal activity must be resisted. Similarly, when such agreements are being drafted, there should not be an inclination to focus on the issue of refoulement as a cornerstone of migration policy. In our endeavours to obtain satisfactory statistical results, we must still pay particular attention to human rights, that is, practical considerations should not upstage moral considerations. It only takes a single case of non-respect for human rights to raise a concern.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Mr President, Commissioner, I think it is necessary to mention one major failing: the fact that there is no system of regulation by which the agreement could be implemented. I believe that in principle this agreement could be supported, but I would like to emphasise once more that it is imperative for the Russian Federation to strengthen its migration controls, so that its government bodies are able to respect the commitments that they will have to enter into from the day the readmission agreement becomes operational.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, I must say that the two international agreements with Russia that you are presenting to us today, one on the measures aimed at facilitating the issuance of visas and the other on readmission, have made us extremely worried.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union’s cooperating with Russia must result in the protection of fundamental rights, including the rights of migrants and asylum seekers, being promoted more effectively. Admittedly, these agreements enable progress to be made, in particular on the price of visas and the simplification of the procedure, but several problems remain. Indeed, the events that took place recently in Russia show that freedom of the press and freedom of expression are not systematically guaranteed there. Europe must therefore keep issuing strong demands to ensure that human rights are protected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You responded to some of our concerns in your statement. The Commission has committed itself to guaranteeing reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement on visas, equal treatment regarding registration procedures and free movement within Russia. Obviously, I would have liked firmer commitments to have been made, particularly on the protection of migrants and the rights of children. I am particularly concerned by the accelerated procedure provided for by the readmission agreement. Will the Commission ensure, moreover, that this procedure complies with the principle of non-refoulement?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also requested clearer commitments for visas, which, in the long run, would have meant putting a stop to the invitation and registration system and simplifying the procedure for bona fide travellers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I must once again reiterate our Parliament’s dissatisfaction with the fact that we were simply consulted on these international agreements, and this, long after they had been concluded. Prior consultation of the European Parliament during the negotiations would also – it must be said – lead to greater democratic control.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the right to travel within Europe is an issue of absolutely fundamental importance to our lives. The fact that the EU is now discussing visa facilitation agreements with its eastern neighbour is, of course, a good thing. It cannot be emphasised enough how important visa rules, in particular, are for the way in which the European Union is perceived by the surrounding world and for the way in which the third country, in this case Russia, is perceived by EU citizens. For anyone who travels in the EU’s border regions, this is often the first issue they encounter. We parliamentarians have a big responsibility. It is our responsibility to assess the agreement and its actual content. It is no secret that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has not been happy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In practice, European travellers to Russia encounter two problems if they are not on a group visit. They have to have an invitation from a Russian organisation or individual. What ordinary EU citizen has such contacts? The second obstacle is that they have to register with a Russian local authority within three days of their arrival, and this can take several days. What are they to do if they are not in Moscow or St Petersburg? None of these issues is addressed by the agreement. We must be clear that the agreement is a declaration and not a document with significant content. If I guess correctly, many people in this House too believe that the agreement involves visa facilitation for all young people and all students. That is not the case. Only those who already have study places would experience some limited relaxation of visa requirements, and, in such cases, visits could not, in any case, exceed 90 days. There are not many study programmes like that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In spite of all the shortcomings, Parliament has shown a constructive attitude. We understand the importance of sending out a political signal. However, it is important for all our citizens that the Commission and the Council should undertake single-mindedly to bring about an appreciable relaxation of visa requirements, beginning now and extending into the future. Without such a pledge, the ALDE Group will vote against the proposals.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission and the Council have put forward a declaration that is partially in keeping with Parliament’s wishes. I do, however, have a question for Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: what is the next step that you now intend to take in order to abolish in practice the duty of registration and the system involving invitations? Both issues are, of course, relevant to the general, overarching objective of the whole agreement, namely that of abolishing the visa system.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the agreements currently being debated are a very important step towards a closer relationship between the European Union and Russia, especially as their adoption will make it significantly easier for people to cross the border.</p>
      <p sl="pl">That is the theory. However, in practice, the situation is not ideal in several respects.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Travel to certain regions of the Russian Federation, notably to Chechnya, will still require additional permits, and the reasons for such decisions by the Russian authorities are surely obvious. The agreement on facilitation does not contain a reciprocal clause on human rights and democracy, which ought to appear in agreements between the Union and third countries as a matter of course.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also difficult to understand why the Joint Readmission Committee is not authorised to monitor compliance with human rights and why individuals seeking political asylum are covered by the Agreement. It would appear that practical and technical matters were prioritised during work on the aforementioned documents, whilst issues relating to respect for the dignity of human beings were sidelined, although they ought to be at the heart of all agreements, especially those entered into with Russia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur for her consistent work in preparing Parliament’s opinion under consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a shadow rapporteur, I am especially satisfied that, following a two-hour discussion with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, my proposal to mention the requirement to undergo a mandatory registration procedure as being a serious obstacle to travel within Russia and the EU has been taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">The requirement to undergo registration in Russia has become an enormous problem for those EU citizens applying for private short-stay visas to Russia. Latvian citizens and non-citizens know this problem from their own negative experience since many of us, especially Russian speakers, mainly go to Russia in order to visit our relatives and friends living there.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new law on migration registration of foreign nationals and stateless persons in the Russian Federation entered into force recently, on 15 January of this year. The law provides some facilitation of the registration procedure and abolishes registration fees but, nevertheless, the system as such is preserved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, such a system is reciprocal, since some EU Member States also demand the registration of certain categories of third-country nationals. Both the Russian and EU sides have to make immediate efforts to find a solution for essential facilitation of movement of people between our countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, since some facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas is better than none at all, our political group is supporting the agreement on this. On the other hand, we maintain our principal reservations with respect to the agreement on readmission.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, nationals of both the EU countries and Russia are required to have visas to travel. Russia has actively called for visa-free travel. To facilitate the granting of visas, we first have to have reciprocal agreements, examples of which are the proposals now before us. The reports by the parliamentary committees condemn the situation regarding the rule of law – its absence, in fact – in Russia. They voice the concern that visas may not be granted for free civil action. They also criticise the compulsory registration procedure and complain about the lack of any rules to implement the Agreement on readmission, human rights problems and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It would seem that the time is not yet ripe for visa-free travel. As long as visas are required, they need to be made easy and cheap for law-abiding citizens to acquire. We should be wary of making visas a political issue.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, reciprocity and solidarity are two values that should be crucial to relations between the European Union and Russia. They are also essential conditions for such a relationship. Reciprocity underpins all international relations. I cannot conceive of agreements between states in which their mutual rights and responsibilities were not presented as being of equal value. Any imbalance would immediately cause an outcry. I am therefore quite certain that the principle of reciprocity must be observed in agreements between the Union and the Russian Federation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe there are two aspects that should be considered in relation to the second value, namely solidarity. Firstly, there is the solidarity between the Member States of the Union, who gave their consent for both agreements to be drafted. I am glad that my own country, Poland, took part in this process. We have been Russia’s neighbour for centuries, and there have been ups and downs in our relationship, as is often the case with neighbours. These agreements prove that we wish to have a good and normal neighbourly relationship with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second aspect to consider is the solidarity between the citizens of the Union and the citizens of the Russian Federation. We will demonstrate this solidarity if we treat Russian citizens as people who are travelling around the Union in good faith, and facilitate their entry and stay amongst us. I should like to emphasise that the citizens of the new Member States are particularly aware of what a blessing freedom of travel is. We know what reducing border crossing formalities means and we value it a great deal. We wish to share those benefits with the Russian citizens, on the basis of the principle of reciprocity and respect for human rights. I think Parliament should support these agreements, because they create a good neighbour policy for the Union.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Ladies and gentlemen, resolving the issue of visa facilitation and readmission is an important task that would promote the consolidation of common values. Both the debate and the answers given by the Commission and the Council show, however, that in truth nothing has been achieved in discussions with Russia – neither a registration procedure nor a simplification of the invitation system. That has been left to rely on Russia’s goodwill. It is not clear why Russia has been given a transition period for the readmission of persons from third countries. Our report of May 2005 on relations between the European Union and Russia stressed that the European Parliament was repeating its call on Russia to ratify the border agreement with Estonia and to sign and ratify the border agreement with Latvia without delay. I believe that the demarcation of borders and the conclusion of a readmission agreement are preconditions for the signing of a visa facilitation agreement. In this respect Russia has not displayed any initiative, but has just dictated its conditions to both countries. Since Parliament has been placed in a totally humiliating position, we believe that it is not possible to support these agreements — a lot of serious work still remains to be done on them.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, from my point of view, the agreement on the facilitation of the visa process with Russia is, despite all the comments and reservations that have been expressed, a step forward. It demonstrates that it is possible for the European Union and Russia to reach a compromise even on complex issues.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Furthermore, let us answer the following question: do we want to make it easier, quicker and cheaper for students, scientists, businesspeople and family members to have access to visas? I believe the answer is yes. Otherwise, access will be selective, something that we in the Czech Republic know all about in our relations with the EU. For example, the process of joining Schengen was slow and fraught with difficulties.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The European Union is bringing down the barriers that hinder people of good will from associating with each other. After five years of negotiations with Russia, the 'visa wall' between the EU and Russia has become a little lower. Once the visa simplification and readmission agreements come into force, a sizeable group of people will be able to travel and interact easier.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Those who are still disadvantaged are Kaliningrad residents who wish to visit Lithuania and Poland, and Lithuanians and Poles who wish to visit Kaliningrad. At the moment there is no charge for visas, but the agreement, which is supposed to make things easier for them, will actually impose the hardship of a EUR 35 charge for a visa. This goes against the principles of cross-border cooperation and against the Kaliningrad region’s anti-isolationist policy, which interests both Russia and the EU. Vilnius, Warsaw, Brussels and Berlin, as well as Moscow, are trying to negotiate bilateral solutions within the margin of flexibility of the Schengen Agreement provisions.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Lithuania has led the way as the first and only EU nation so far to have a readmission agreement with Russia. Three years of experience have been positive. Since the agreement has been in force, the Lithuanian-Russian border has been crossed by almost 2 million people; however, not once have the provisions of the agreement needed to be invoked.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I agree with a number of colleagues who have sharply criticised the agreement, especially for the lack of sufficient nexus to human rights and liberties. Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction. On the long road toward the 'demolition of the visa wall' there are still a lot of obstacles. EU citizens coming to Russia have to register, and if they want to visit certain regions, extra permits are needed. These 'hidden' internal visas need to be done away with, because they restrict EU citizens’ freedom of movement. This issue must be talked about honestly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for the many important things you have said, but also for being realistic enough to see that it is not, of course, possible to agree on everything. The fact is that all of us would have liked to see something in line with our own thinking, and, as indeed one speaker said earlier on, all this is an important step forward, but we need many more of them.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear from the joint statement by the Commission and the Council that we had, in various areas, due regard to the principle of mutuality, which is an important one. What is equally important is respect for human rights, and of that you rightly reminded us. While I do not wish to confuse these two considerations, they are, of course, connected in some way. The importance of dialogue with Russia has already been highlighted in various debates.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although demands are always being made that we should get our way on various fronts, if, for example, there is still no go-ahead given for the negotiation of the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, there is no possibility of our making demands, expressing aspirations, or putting forward what you have requested, and it is for that reason that it is high time that the green light was given.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that we will be able to find a suitable solution to the problem that still hangs over this issue. Even though there may be things that we cannot accept as regards respect for human rights, there is nonetheless the twice-yearly human rights consultation between the European Union and Russia, which present an opportunity for raising such issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some of you made reference to the issue of bureaucratisation. While we would, of course, have wished to do many things differently in this area, the regime has nonetheless been relaxed as regards necessary invitations, and I am sure that the Commissioner will have something more to say about this. This has not, of course, been done to the extent that some of you demanded, but it is nonetheless evident from this that we are making progress, albeit often with only small steps, for it is small steps forward that are called for in dialogue, particularly with Russia.</p>

The European Parliament needs to be consulted before the conclusion of the agreement, as laid down in paragraph 3 of that article. This provision also applies in areas of codecision, so in my view the procedures set up by the EC Treaty have been fully respected, both on readmission and on visa facilitation. I wanted to say that, because it came up in the discussion. At the same time, however, I can also reiterate that of course we are at your disposal to provide any relevant information, even during the ongoing negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also fully share the view that the promotion and the safeguard of human rights in our relationships with Russia, and in connection with those agreements in particular, are of course a fundamental aspect. The Commission, assisted by the EU Member States, will therefore monitor this issue very closely in the context of the joint committees set up by the agreements and, of course, human dignity – the dignity of the human being – is certainly very important here and has priority. Furthermore, the regular semi-annual consultations between the European Union and Russia on human rights are always an occasion where we can address broader concerns with Russia and human rights issues are always raised at the Summit and at ministerial levels, as appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The visa facilitation agreement constitutes a real improvement of the status quo. It is indeed, as our colleague said, a step forward. It contains important facilitations for issuing short-stay visas which will then apply on a reciprocal basis to citizens of the Schengen Member States and of the Russian Federation. Some of these facilitations apply to all visa applicants and others to specific categories who have a particular interest in travelling, while the agreement provides for legally binding rights and obligations, which will ensure somewhat greater flexibility in the visa procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to draw your attention in particular to the fact that we, the Commission, have managed to negotiate important visa facilitation for journalists, for instance, who will no longer require an invitation or a validation by the Russian authorities, and special attention will also be paid to effective reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement, equal treatment regarding registration procedures for EU and Russian nationals and the free movement of persons within Russian territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">You raised two topics, namely registration requirements and the removal of invitations. I would like to just say that the agreement includes a commitment to simplify the registration procedures, with a view to ensuring equal treatment for EU and Russian citizens, and I would like to remind you that the Schengen acquis also imposes a general obligation for aliens to register. We have raised this issue with the Russian authorities on several occasions and new legislation, which entered into force in Russia last month, is already in place to simplify these procedures. According to this law, an appearance in person will no longer be required for registration. Of course, we will now monitor and seek further clarification of these rules. I would also like to say that the visa facilitation agreement introduces another important change, namely the fact that validation of invitations by the Russian authorities is no longer required. In comparison with the current situation, where the invitation from the Russian host needs to be validated, this is, I think, a great improvement for a large category of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the agreement does not abolish the invitations and their validation for all EU citizens applying for Russian visas. However, it should be borne in mind that the Schengen acquis also requires any person applying for a visa to justify the purpose of the travel and present supporting documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also would like to say that the readmission agreement contains important elements for humane and more effective return management in the future and I would just like to reiterate what I said at the beginning. In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article 18 of the agreement. So it is clear that this will be an important aspect.</p>
      <p sl="en">I could go on giving you all the details, because I have listened very carefully. However, I think this matter has already been discussed in the LIBE Committee, so just let me say that I hope the House will follow the committee’s recommendation and give a positive opinion on both agreements. It will make a change for our citizens and ultimately this may be what matters most.</p>

      <p sl="et">The groundwork for the agreement signed between the European Union and Russia concerning the facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas was laid in May 2003 at the St Petersburg summit. The agreement was intended as part of a process that was designed to strengthen relations between the parties through the creation of a common area founded on freedom, security and justice.</p>
      <p sl="et">I see an agreement, but not the common area that was meant to arise. Parliament will not retreat from its repeated demand that international agreements signed on behalf of the European Union contain a mutual human rights and democracy clause. The agreement on the facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas with Russia does not contain that clause.</p>
      <p sl="et">At the same time, Russia has paid lip service to a significant requirement of the European Union’s visa facilitation policy, according to which the agreement on readmission should already have been concluded, or be at the active negotiating stage. The readmission agreement was proposed by Parliament together with the visa facilitation agreement. In addition, Russia has been granted a very generous transition period before the actual commencement of readmission.</p>
      <p sl="et">I repeatedly drew attention to the absurd situation according to which the European Union makes it easier for Russian citizens to cross a border that Russia itself does not recognise. Moscow has not yet ratified the Estonian-Russian Border Treaty. Logically, the recognition of that border should be the precondition for the establishment and amendment of the border regime.</p>
      <p sl="et">In order to support democracy, 16 years ago the European Union and the United States adopted an approach that treated Russia as a promising young country. This overly generous treatment continues, though it is no longer appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is in Europe’s interests to treat Russia as a full partner that must fulfil its international obligations just like any other.</p>

    <intervention id="3-290" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Gloser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to make a few comments on your Members’ reports on the economic policy guidelines for 2007. You will recall that it was last December that the Commission presented its annual report on the Lisbon process, in which it discusses the progress that has been made with the Lisbon Strategy across the Community and in the Member States, and also makes recommendations specific to individual countries on economic and employment policy, which will be elaborated by the ECOFIN Council and by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection Council jointly, although each Council configuration will concentrate on matters within its own remit.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are therefore glad to see that your House has given thought to these economic policy guidelines, and, in addition to this debate today, we will also have another opportunity for exchanging views at the Troika meeting on 26 February.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s progress report met with broad approval from the ECOFIN Council when it met in January. In particular, we can endorse the report’s fundamentally positive outlook. The first concrete results of the reform process are becoming visible across the EU and in the Member States, in that we can see the beginnings of an overall improvement in the economy and employment in the European Union as the renewed Lisbon Strategy bears fruit. It nevertheless has to be said – as it was yesterday in various ways – that there is no reason for complacency. We should be set on using the present favourable economic position as a means for accomplishing further reforms, and this is made all the more important by the prospect of demographic change presenting financial policy with considerable challenges. What is needed in order to consolidate the long-term sustainability of public finance is a three-pillar strategy, in other words a combination of reform of the pension and health care system, reduction of state debt and enhanced employment and productivity, while the quality of public finance needs to be improved by restructuring public budgets with a greater bias towards expenditure that promotes productivity and innovation and builds up human resources, and so the country-specific recommendations are a good instrument for moving the modernisation of our economy forward and enhancing the European Union’s ability to hold its own in global competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">Starting with Mr Bullmann’s report, there are two aspects of it on which I should like to comment briefly. Firstly, one point made in it is that financial and economic policy needs to be better coordinated, especially within the euro zone. Demands that this be done come as no surprise to me, for they have been made repeatedly over the years, but, if one considers closely the present situation, it quickly becomes evident that there is no lack of coordination procedures in the economic and monetary union; indeed, there are too many of them rather than too few, with, for example, the economic policy guidelines – which we are discussing today – and the budget policy monitoring procedure, to name but two. What matters most of all in practice is that these procedures be applied consistently and effectively, and, by presenting its country-specific recommendations, the Commission has taken the first step to this end.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point has more to do with the institutions; it relates to the concrete proposal in Mr Bullmann’s report for the setting-up, following the Spring Summit, of an interinstitutional working party to consider the review of the Integrated Guidelines scheduled for 2008. Far be it from me to give a final evaluation of this proposal today; I am sure you will understand that it is an in-depth examination, rather than a personal estimate, that is called for, but I have to say that it does not, at first sight, appear to me to be wholly compatible with the way work is shared out between the institutions under the Treaties. Quite apart from that, though, the fact of the matter is that communication between the Council and your House has constantly improved over recent years, something attributable not least to the troika meetings and sittings such as this one. I am also aware, however, that there is always progress to be made.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me now turn to Mr Andersson’s report. As required by Article 128(2) of the European Communities Treaty, the Council, acting on the Commission’s proposal, lays down every year guidelines that the Member States follow in their employment policy. In order, however, to ensure the continuity needed for proper implementation, it was agreed in 2002 that the employment policy guidelines would, in principle, be altered only every three years. It was also agreed that they should be brought into line with the economic policy guidelines. It was on this basis that, in 2005, the first integrated guidelines were laid down for the period from then to 2008. In 2006, then, the Commission proposed that the employment policy guidelines laid down in 2005 should be left unchanged. Your House has repeatedly urged that it be allowed sufficient time to carefully elaborate its position, since the tight deadlines involved in the annual employment cycle usually made it necessary to invoke the urgency procedure. There has been an exchange of letters on this subject between your House and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">For 2008, your House has asked for more time for a hearing, on the grounds that it will involve a comprehensive triennial examination of the employment policy guidelines, and we will consult with the Commission when considering this. A position on the timetable for the procedure in 2008 is unfortunately not available at the present time. This year, it is to be expected that the Council, as soon as the opinions of your House, ECOSOC, the Committee of the Regions and of the Employment Committee are forthcoming, will, at the 30/31 May Council meeting, be able to achieve policy agreement on the employment policy guidelines for 2007, which would then be formally adopted before summer this year. As Mr Andersson indeed stated in his report, the fact is that – quite apart from previous successes in terms of more people in work and fewer people out of it – there is a need for further purposeful effort if the goals set are to be achieved within the European Union. By way of conclusion, I would like once more to emphasise that these include, in particular, an increase in the participation of young people and older persons in the labour market, together with an improvement in the compatibility of work and family life. While I am aware that this is right at the top of the agenda in many Member States, I am also aware that there are those in which action is needed in this area.</p>

    <intervention id="3-291" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, with your permission, I shall speak in my mother tongue.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating jointly the report by Mr Bullmann, on the broad economic policy guidelines, and the report by Mr Andersson, on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Both reports are based on last December’s Commission Communication on the implementation by the Member States of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, and the integrated guidelines for 2005-2008, which was approved by the Council following consultation of this Parliament and on the proposal of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today's debate is taking place during the weeks leading up to the Spring European Council of 8 March and involves cooperating in the preparations for that Council. Just this morning, this Parliament adopted a resolution expressing this Parliament’s assessment of the implementation to date of the renewed Lisbon Strategy and stressing the areas and policies in which decisive action by the Member States and the European Union is needed.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is important to stress that the reports that we are debating today and the opinion of this Parliament and of the European Commission are in agreement on a series of fundamental points. Firstly, both Parliament and the Commission acknowledge the results that we are beginning to see, both in terms of economic growth and in terms of employment, thanks to the application of the policies agreed within the renewed framework of the Lisbon Strategy and thanks in particular to the budgetary consolidation and structural reform efforts made by the majority of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Just yesterday, Eurostat published the European Union’s GDP growth figures for the fourth quarter of 2006. That information indicates that the joint growth for 2006 was practically 3%. That would represent the highest rhythm of increase in our GDP since the Lisbon Strategy was launched in 2000.</p>
      <p sl="es">Although Parliament and the Commission are in agreement, we must nevertheless be sure to emphasise this point, to emphasise the fact that we are beginning to see the positive results of the strategies implemented a few years ago. It is important that the citizens receive the message that the efforts made since the Stability and Growth Pact was implemented, since the Lisbon Strategy was implemented – efforts that have not always been easy to accept or understand – are yielding fruit and helping to strengthen the European social model within the context of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Many of the difficulties faced by the European project in terms of public opinion over recent times result from the fear amongst the citizens, in certain sectors of our society, that globalisation is lowering standards in a way that undermines the foundations of our social model, and that the European Union and the policies and strategies decided upon here are unable to prevent it. Some people even accuse the European Union of provoking and speeding up that deterioration of the European social model.</p>
      <p sl="es">The results we are seeing demonstrate clearly that that is not the case. Those people who believe that Europe has become stagnant and that the rigidity of the labour markets is preventing job creation are also wrong. The figures show that, since the euro was created on 1 January 1999, eight years ago now, the European Union has created four times as many jobs as it had created over the previous eight years. Furthermore, during this decade, since the Lisbon Strategy was launched, the European Union has clearly been creating more jobs than the United States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some people describe the budgetary policies as restrictive and accuse the Stability and Growth Pact of slowing down economic growth, but the reality is that it is the countries with the best budgetary accounts, with budget surpluses, both in the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole, that for some time have been experiencing the highest levels of economic growth. The truth is that fiscal consolidation makes progress and improves in parallel with the increase and improvement in our growth and job creation figures.</p>
      <p sl="es">There has recently been a lot of talk about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen being an obstacle to our exports, but the fact is that the euro zone’s trade balance, in relation to the United States, has improved again in 2006 and that the rise in oil prices has partly been compensated for by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, ladies and gentlemen, the improvement in our economies and the acceleration of job creation are clear evidence that the European social and economic model, with its high level of social protection and its environmental demands, is perfectly compatible with the globalisation of the economy and with economic growth. Europe, its countries, our economies, have always worked better when they have opened up to the world and, now that the global economy is undergoing an unprecedented expansion, Europe and its citizens have much to gain from this opening up of our borders and the increased integration of our economies at global level.</p>
      <p sl="es">Sending this message to the citizens is not just a way to vindicate the economic and social policies that we have been advocating over recent years: it is crucial in terms of increasing confidence in Europe's capacity to provide the European citizens with well-being and offers us a solid basis for strengthening the political will necessary in order to move ahead with the structural reforms laid down in the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second point on which there is fundamental agreement between the reports we are debating today and the opinion of the European Commission is the need to enhance the reforms initiated through the implementation of national reform plans by the Member States. In this regard, the dynamism of the emerging economies, the ageing of the population, the growth potential, which is still low, in many European economies, the continuing budgetary imbalances in certain Member States, the low growth in productivity and the segmentation of the labour market are some of the very powerful reasons for continuing to implement policies leading to greater innovation capacity, greater life-long training opportunities, better functioning of the markets and healthier public finances.</p>
      <p sl="es">The third significant area of agreement between Parliament and the Commission relates to the need to act not just in each of the Member States, but also at European level, in order to make progress on achieving an internal market in sectors that are crucial to our economy, such as the energy sector and the financial services sector, in order to increase support for innovation, in order to create a more favourable environment for business activity and greater adaptability of the markets in products and services and of the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of these priority areas for action at European level, the reports rightly place the emphasis on the issue of energy, which will be one of the key issues at the Spring European Council, which is going to debate the energy package proposed by the Commission on 10 January. The degree of commitment and ambition demonstrated by the Heads of State or Government in terms of creating a genuine common energy policy will be decisive when it comes to assessing whether the response to the challenge of guaranteeing our energy supply, while at the same time tackling climate change, is credible. When it comes to tackling these challenges, action by each of the Member States separately will clearly be insufficient and joint action at European level will therefore be required in order to defend the interests of the citizens properly.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, both the report by Mr Bullmann and the report by Mr Andersson express the need for Parliament to be able to exercise its prerogatives properly when it comes to revising the integrated guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, which is scheduled for next year. I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission is fully committed, particularly those of us in the College who are directly involved with the Lisbon Strategy, Vice-President Verheugen, Commissioner Špidla and myself, and we have a common desire to explore all possible ways to involve Parliament effectively in this revision.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall end, Mr President, by expressing my desire for this plenary to endorse the practically unanimous support of the respective committees for the reports by Mr Bullmann and Mr Andersson. Through this support and through the high degree of consensus between Parliament and the Commission, we will be sending a clear signal to the European Council and to the citizens in general of the European Union's will and capacity to create a specific instrument to tackle the risks and take advantage of the opportunities presented by globalisation, while defending and enhancing Europe's economic progress and social cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the report I have prepared on the employment guidelines is extremely short and has been accepted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. It is really about how we are to deal with next year’s employment guidelines and integrated guidelines, for our current guidelines are to remain unchanged this year, but next year we shall see a more radical review. Just as Commissioner Almunia said, we therefore anticipate being able to devote a little more time to the issue, and we need more time in Parliament too. That is something I really wish to emphasise, for there is a difference between the employment and the economic guidelines. The employment guidelines cannot be adopted by the Council until Parliament has made its position known. Constructive cooperation between the institutions is therefore required before next year. We made things easier in the run-up to this year. We did so last year too, when no great review took place. Next year’s review is to be a major one, so we are expecting cooperation extending over several months. We have, in actual fact, already had a discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs between the coordinators and myself about not delaying in appointing a rapporteur to prepare the work before next year’s changes.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I wish, for all that, nonetheless to say something about the situation, even if it is only addressed in the justification. Things are genuinely going better for Europe. Employment trends are more encouraging than they were a few years ago. Unemployment is declining. We have sound growth. We must not forget, however, that there are still deficiencies which we must concentrate on remedying. I am thinking of young people who leave school early and young people who become unemployed immediately their education is finished. We know that, if they remain outside the labour market for a long time, it becomes incredibly difficult to get them back into it again. I am thinking of the still considerable differences between the situations of men and women in the labour market. I am thinking of people who have come to us from other parts of the world and who, even today, have problems entering the labour market due to the shortcomings of our integration policy. I am thinking of people with disabilities, who are also excluded from the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I attended the informal Council of Ministers meeting involving the employment ministers, a meeting that addressed another aspect of employment, namely that we want jobs that are actually better. It is true that we have more jobs, but we want higher-quality jobs too. What, then, is meant by ‘better jobs’? The fact is, we mean jobs that offer living wages and jobs that entail professional development and offer the further training that is so necessary if people are to be able to cope successfully in the labour market. We are also concerned here with good working environments and with giving employees the opportunity to exercise influence, both individually and through their trade unions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The current trend towards more jobs does not always mean better jobs. That is a state of affairs of which we are aware, and there are debates about it in quite a few countries, for example in Germany, which I visited recently. I also know from my own country that a proportion of the new jobs are what are known as atypical and do not always provide a living wage or opportunities for further training. The influence that people in these jobs are able to exercise is also fairly minimal. We must, then, also concentrate on creating not only more jobs but also high-quality jobs. Europe will never be able to compete in the world market by creating low-wage jobs and jobs that do not enable people to provide for themselves. Instead, it will only be able to compete by creating high-quality jobs that offer, for example, further training and the opportunity to exercise influence.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is a subject to which we intend to return next year when we carry out the more thorough review of employment trends, looking at more and better jobs and at groups that at present still have difficulty entering the labour market.</p>

    <intervention id="3-296" speaker_id="4267" name="Udo BULLMANN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="08-06-1956" birth_place="Gießen" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as Commissioner Almunia pointed out, we have, in practical terms, got our growth back up to 3%, and are therefore back on the course set by Lisbon. It is this continuous 3% growth that we aimed to achieve by means of the Lisbon Strategy, enabling us to implement the social and economic reforms that are needed in order that everyone in Europe may benefit. It is precisely because there were many years in which we did not achieve this that we need to remind ourselves that this will not happen on its own. Much in this upturn has to do, in the first instance, with the economic cycle, and it is because we cannot be certain that it will continue that our report takes the line that action on our part is needed, that we need to manage and direct, that we must not take time out and allow the clock to keep ticking while we neglect to take the necessary political steps.</p>
      <p sl="de">The single market is our great trump card, performing better than the internal market in the USA. 90% of what we manufacture in the European Union, we – as consumers – buy back from our own companies, and that gives us strength to cope with the vicissitudes of globalisation. It is right, then, that this internal market should be completed, whether as regards financial services, energy, or the free movement of workers in Europe, for whom this is a fundamental right, albeit one that we have yet to put into effect, but this single market can function only if we endow it with a political framework – only if we are bold enough to give it form and ensure that the social checks and balances are in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is so important to call to mind the fact that we have succeeded in creating that social balance; we did so with the Services Directive. It is only when people are able to support themselves properly by their own labour in this internal market that they will be able, as consumers, to support an economic upturn; it is only then that they will be able, as consumers, to invest, and only then that they will be able, as workers, to acquire further skills and qualifications and to play their decisive part in fostering innovation in our societies. That is why it is so important that this report should ask the Member States just where they are, how far they have come, and just what they have done about achieving the great targets that we set ourselves at Lisbon. It is crystal clear that they are beginning to come up with some answers, but those answers are still slow in coming and are not framed everywhere with the same quality that we would like to see; active employment policy and social integration policy, in particular, leave something to be desired. Looking at the positive outcomes, we can see that the countries that are ahead are the ones that are bold enough, instead of making savings to the point where nothing works, to invest in the active parts of society, in small and medium-sized enterprises, in those who are at school, in those who are doing their apprenticeships, in those who are studying for university degrees and are thereby bringing new creativity into society.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not fortuitous that many Scandinavian countries, working according to the Nordic model, are producing the best results on this front. While it is up to each and every country to find its own best solution, we would strongly encourage the Member States to play their part in putting the pro-active Lisbon approach into practice and carrying on with it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am grateful to the President-in-Office, Mr Gloser, for not, in his speech, disregarding the report, but instead saying ‘yes’ to dialogue, and I would urge him to be courageous, for I can find nothing in the Treaty that forbids us from developing closer forms of cooperation where the reform of the Integrated Guidelines and preparing Lisbon and the economic policy guidelines for a new stage are concerned. This House expects to be involved – as is only right and proper – for that is the only way in which we can help to communicate the Lisbon goals to the public, to businesses, to trade unions and to workers. I think the Commission is right to think in terms of coming up with more proposals on this front; why should such proposals not be adopted by the European Council as guidelines and thus give the Member States firmer guidance?</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not want to close without extending very warm thanks to the services – both the committee’s and those of the groups – for their contribution to the production of the report, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Montoro Romero, Mrs in 't Veld, Mrs Rühle and Mrs Wagenknecht, whose excellent cooperation has made it possible to present a unanimous report.</p>

      <p sl="es">We are dealing with a good report. I believe that Mr Bullmann has done an excellent job, an open job, in order to produce an analysis of the European economy at this time. It is a hopeful time, but it is also a time for realistic analysis.</p>
      <p sl="es">This report also stresses that we must make a precise diagnosis of whether we are dealing with a strictly cyclical recovery or something more. I hope that it is something more, but we must also tell the European citizens that we must carry on working because the rationalisation of public finances we saw last year may also be due to cyclical factors and not to deliberate or structural decisions.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the report does, we must accept that what has failed in the European economy over recent years has been the weakness of internal demand, that is to say, confidence, consumer and investor confidence, and that is extremely negative in terms of the European project. We must also stress the need for reforms: reforms of the labour market that have been discussed and agreed; reforms of economic policies to promote small and medium-sized businesses, which are key to the growth and creation of employment; reforms intended to complete the single market, particularly in services and in the energy sector; reforms to improve the efficiency of the markets in goods, services, work and capital; and also fiscal reforms aimed at providing a coordinated fiscal framework that stimulates the creation of jobs and promotes the creation and development of the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprise that we believe to be fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, this report stresses the need to combat protectionism, which unfortunately is present in many of our current European governments, and we also warn that the risk associated with the euro-dollar exchange rate may threaten the quality of our economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Almunia, Mr Gloser, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work; I believe that this report presents both an analysis and recommendations that my group can fully support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like simply to highlight three aspects. The outlook for the euro zone in terms of growth and competitiveness is improving. However, as the report says – and this is my first remark – there are some very important differences between the Member States. I believe that we should try to learn some lessons from this, or, in any case, try to understand why this is so. Things are not always easy; many elements come into play. In particular, the report mentions the difference between the situation of a number of large Member States and that of smaller ones, but, ultimately, it is more complicated than that, since we can also observe spectacular differences in results among the large Member States. Germany has performed averagely, with 2.7% growth last year, which is a very good result compared with previous years. However, with 2% growth, other large Member States, such as Italy, and also my country, France, are below average in terms of EU growth, something that only happened two years ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is combined with other elements that are fairly worrying, since the differences in external trade are just as spectacular. Germany is a record-breaker again, showing an ability to conquer international markets, while France, which for a very long time was a country with a very strong international trade surplus, is producing one record trade deficit after another, quarter after quarter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and a number of small Member States have obtained good results in terms of growth, employment and international trade. There is a first lesson to be learnt from this, one that has perhaps come to my mind as a result of my country’s situation. It is that, in a country in which for five years, there has been one, let us say, liberal, structural reform after another, in which it was explained to us that that which was going to enable us to resolve the crisis, and the employment crisis in particular, was to reduce taxes – corporation tax, income tax – to jeopardise some forms of employment protection – we had a 'new employment' contract, which undermined protection against redundancies, etc. – to weaken public services and to privatise, we have not obtained a single result. On the contrary, some countries that have kept compulsory levies and higher labour costs than France are, for their part, showing important results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have learnt a second lesson from this, which is that not only has this formula been ineffective, but it is wrong to think that Europe will cope if it practices downwards competition. It is not by practising a form of competition based on low costs that Europe will manage to extricate itself, but by investing in human resources, in innovation, in research, in training and in universities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third remark, and a point rightly noted in the report, is that, despite this overall increase in growth and economic results, poverty continues to be a problem. Even when compared with the 1990s, the level of poverty within the European Union has gone up again. At the end of the day, there are 80 million Europeans living below the 60% average income threshold.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this issue, I believe that we should also learn a lesson from what took place under President Clinton in the United States, which back then experienced a boom with the new economy, a boom that at the same time did not prevent serious poverty from continuing to somewhat poison society, because the Welfare programmes could not be implemented. We too must combine investments with the knowledge-based economy, the competitive economy and social cohesion. The two go hand in hand and support each other.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, who has considerably lightened the shadow rapporteurs’ load by submitting an excellent text that needed hardly any editing, and. with which, as it is now before us, I too am pleased, for it contains many excellent recommendations, although many of them we have, of course, made before, and what is lacking is action. Many of these things have not been implemented. It is true that the economy is picking up, but this is no time to rest on our laurels. Where, for example, the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, now is the time when the preventive leg should enter into force. Rather than blowing the kitty, we should keep the budget in good shape, reduce debts, invest, and in that sense, I am completely at one with Mr Bullmann. This should not, however, take on the form that it often does, namely subsidies that distort the market and replace the desperately-needed reforms. This is often simply used as a fig leaf, which is not the idea.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am all in favour of completing the internal market, and I hope that the Services Directive, which was far too weak for my liking, will have some impact on that front after all. A great deal needs to be done in the area of labour market measures too, and I would like to say, briefly, that I see the social model as one in which all Europeans are given opportunities, but the one we have at present is still systematically excluding 8% of the people from the labour market, and not only eastern European workers and immigrants. We would rather have them drown in the Mediterranean than give them access to our labour market. It is meanwhile the case that we have been turning a blind eye to the fact that people working illegally on our markets under the most abominable conditions are almost kept as slaves. This is not so much a social model as a disgrace for Europe, so as far as I am concerned, the free movement of eastern European workers could not come any sooner, complete with an immigration system and green card.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, some question the merits of more coordination of national economic policy. We should have another discussion on this some time. I think it is, at any rate, far preferable than the current trend towards protectionism and Member States competing against one another, for the fact is that, if we in Europe want to be of any significance in the world economy, we have to ensure that we have a strong, open market, which means that we have to focus on areas of future significance, that is to say on energy, innovation and sustainable development – areas in which we should become world leaders.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteurs on their work. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will support these reports. As I only have a short time available, I shall just raise a couple of issues.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present, the economies of the Member States of the European Union are in need of genuine internal solidarity and cohesion, in order to meet the challenges of competition in the long term. We can congratulate ourselves on a real economic revival, as demonstrated by the growth of GDP. However, we would do well to remember that we are not alone. Our population of 500 million does not even account for 8% of the world’s population. Our competitors include not only the United States, but also, and maybe most importantly. India, China, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nowadays, it is the economy, access to strategic raw materials and demographic potential that represent real strength. These three pillars are closely related. Accordingly, if we do not adopt a family-friendly policy that is truly harmonised with the economy, and also with regard to employment issues, then we are likely not only to lag behind in the near future but to actually collapse altogether. The Lisbon Strategy is not an end in itself. All its actions must aim to promote the individual and his or her development, that is to say, the development of a European citizen.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing I have to say is that the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ label now gets stuck on everything, irrespective of how little it has to do with the Strategy’s original objective. Although it was employment policy that first prompted the Lisbon Strategy and constituted its primary goal, that is now becoming no more than an appendix to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">This redefinition has been accomplished as a matter of policy, as a means of obfuscation and avoiding the admission that, while the EU’s economic data may be taking a turn for the better, no comparable upward trend is to be found in the employment figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I would like to remind the House that the EU’s Heads of State or Government, at every spring summit, undertake to apply the growth and employment guidelines to their own national policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, when they do so, the core concern is to combat the social exclusion of people, for that is the only way to effectively reduce long-term unemployment and poverty, and, in so doing, particular attention needs to be given to groups who, by reason of their personal characteristics, are especially subject to discrimination in trying to get into the labour market, such as, for example, people with disabilities and migrant women.</p>
      <p sl="de">This year, though, the Council and the Commission have simply allowed this core concern to be forgotten about, even though there is no cause for them to do so, for exclusion is as much a problem as it ever was. We cannot accept that employment policy should be biased towards those who are already in work. The guideline currently in force must be taken as seriously as it ever has been, and the great coalition must not be allowed to get away with giving it a different priority and simply looking away when social need is most pressing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the economic policy guidelines contains a large number of statements that I can go along with. It states that, rather than economic growth being an end in itself, the focus must be on people’s quality of life. It advocates not only that economic growth should be export-oriented, but also that it should be responsive to demand, and it manifests concern about the continuing high incidence of poverty within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although all that is laudable and – alas – not always obvious to the Members of this House, the report does also include passages that make a vote in its favour impossible. What is certainly not acceptable from our group’s standpoint is the favourable mention given to the neo-liberal Services Directive, which will further encourage wage dumping and the despoliation of social services in the European Union, thereby helping to make poverty and social exclusion even more widespread.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also see it as unacceptable that the report should call for further liberalisation of the energy sector. What Europe in fact needs is not even more deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation, but the very opposite; what we need is a radically different economic policy in which, for once, the interests of workers and consumers are treated as more important than big business’s interest in private profit.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bullmann report shows that economies of countries which have not yet adopted the euro are performing better than those who have. Indeed, I must congratulate Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. They have not only shaken off the shackles of Communism but also embraced the free market, low taxation and minimal regulation. Is it any wonder they have the highest growth rates in Europe?</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I must warn them that this has ended. It will all be downhill from here. Latvia will adopt the euro in 2008, Lithuania and Slovakia in 2009 and Estonia in 2010 and they will be hamstrung by EU regulation, EU targets and by the EU continually meddling in their economic affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think we should all worry when the report informs us that the European Union must play a more active role in determining economic policy. One size does not fit all and individual countries know best how to find their markets, manage their economies and trade with the world. Please give them economic independence.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest data on the economic situation are on the whole positive but, as the Commission has stressed, growth in productivity and job quality are still below the levels that Europe needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope that these encouraging data will not be an excuse for making less effort, but a clear signal that we have identified the key, strategic points and that we must continue to concentrate on these. I appeal to both the European institutions and to the individual Member States in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="it">I refer in particular to three areas of action: 1) learning and retraining programmes, and programmes linking universities and other training establishments with the world of work; 2) responses to the demographic challenge, such as support for women and families, and the reform and harmonisation of social security systems; and 3) support, as yet insufficient, for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular to enable them to adapt to the latest challenges of international trade and to using new technologies and innovations. These are the areas that still need a lot of work.</p>

      <p sl="es">Europe is currently facing two great challenges: on the one hand, economic globalisation and, on the other, the ageing of the population, and all of this combined with the phenomenon of immigration. Both require clear modernisation of the European social model. As you know, competitiveness is the key element in terms of facing the challenge of globalisation. We all know that we cannot compete with the emerging countries in terms of labour costs, but we have a clear advantage, our human capital, given its capacity, its flexibility and its creativity, and we also have the crucial values of solidarity, equal opportunities and inclusiveness.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the ageing of the population, in order to confront this challenge and to be able to guarantee pensions and healthcare in the future, it is essential that we increase productivity, and amongst other things that requires more jobs and also better quality jobs. There is a general consensus amongst the Member States that it is necessary to modernise legislation in the field of employment protection. In this regard, the combination of flexibility and security, which we often call ‘flexisecurity’, is a key element that must be developed in the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also need, firstly, to apply a strategy of active ageing, with more training for people over 45 and with financial and tax incentives to extend working lives beyond 65. Secondly, to guarantee an appropriate immigration policy, in accordance with a proposal that is based on a broad European agreement enabling it to be controlled in an ordered fashion and immigrants to be integrated by means of training and recycling plans suited to their profiles.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, to promote a reform of public pensions systems with a view to ensuring that they are sustainable through consolidation of public finances and incentives to supplement them by means of individual plans.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall end, ladies and gentlemen, by stating that we still have a long way to go in order to achieve an effective and inclusive European labour market, which above all is focussed on life-long employment, and in which everybody, regardless of their age and conditions, receives the assistance and opportunities they require.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on his excellent report, and I am pleased that other political groups are backing it too. The report can already be seen as a first instalment on the discussion which is indeed to take place some time later this year about the review of the broad economic guidelines. It is vitally important for this report to be used properly in this context, because it contains a number of points that will prove very useful during this evaluation. It assesses the achievements by the Member States and the European economy as a whole in the light of these recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would, in this connection, like to move the focus slightly away from Commissioner Almunia’s statements. He claimed that the countries that comply with the Stability and Growth Pact most effectively, are the best achievers. I would, based on my own experience in the Netherlands, put this slightly differently, and I can identify more with the rapporteur’s statement that it is mainly those countries that have carried out structural reforms, combined with investments, that have done well. I am delighted that we will now have a Cabinet in the Netherlands – the team of ministers will be put in place this week – which will put investments first, in combination with the reforms that have already been carried out, while carefully observing the standards of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is a very important basis, to my mind. A number of recommendations that are made in the guidelines are also reflected in the present government agreement, for example about labour market participation of the elderly, women or migrant groups.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One point that is very important in this connection – and I should also like to underline it on behalf of my political group – is the emphasis on European coordination. Member States should not have to act as individuals, but a simultaneous, coordinated effort is, in fact, of key importance. This is why I should very much like to advise the German Presidency to work hand in hand with this interinstitutional working party that is being introduced, and, in particular, to look at what can be coordinated macro-economically at European level. This whole discussion on more coordinated economic and employment policy started in Essen 10 or 12 years ago. It is a challenge for Germany to develop this further now.</p>

      <p sl="et">Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the new three-year steering cycle that was launched two years ago with the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, with which the general guidelines of labour and economic policy were merged, permits Member States to adapt national Lisbon programmes to the conditions in a particular country.</p>
      <p sl="et">For the first time after the slow economic growth or even standstill of the past six years, European economic growth has begun to accelerate. This positive trend is also reflected in the labour market, and proves the mutual connection between economic policy and social protection. The twofold increase in labour productivity has reduced average unemployment to eight percent. Last year 2.9 million new jobs were created, but much still remains to be done, and we should not yet feel completely satisfied.</p>
      <p sl="et">Today only a few Member States have adopted a fully integrated life-cycle-based approach to work. We must take seriously the implementation of decisions we have already made; that is, that each young person who graduates from school or university be offered work, that child care be broadly available, that laws and regulations concerning labour protection be up to date, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to thank the rapporteur for a realistic report and emphasise that the European Parliament is a suitable forum for the assessment of strategies and measures to enable us to fulfil the Lisbon objectives through joint action and improved cooperation. This is the right and obligation assigned to us by the people.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I have read both reports by my honourable friends with interest and would like to comment on three numbers: 8, 17 and 12 500</p>
      <p sl="el">It is true that unemployment in the European Union is fluctuating today around 8%, which is an unacceptable figure in a Union with the declared intention of becoming the best and most productive economy by 2010.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second number is the percentage of citizens in the Union living below the poverty line which, at 17%, corresponds to 80 million European citizens who cannot get by on a daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as you will already know, the multinational Alcatel Lucent has decided to lay off 12 500 workers over the next three years, most of whom work in Europe. After the Volkswagen scandal, you will understand that the social and employment fabric of the Union is being seriously shaken up.</p>
      <p sl="el">We can therefore continue wishful thinking about the Lisbon Strategy repeatedly. Unfortunately the truth is different and bitter. However, if there is one thing that I can retain from the reports, it is the need for Parliament to have more say on employment matters.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The news brought to us by Mr Almunia is encouraging but I feel that more ambition is needed when it comes to productivity and job quality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Jobs – productive jobs – are what Europe needs and they are created in companies, and companies will only appear if there are plenty of high-calibre entrepreneurs ready to take risks. Consequently, we must do everything we can to promote an appetite for risk-taking and to raise the profile of entrepreneurship. It is an area in which I feel much more can be done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another vital ingredient in creating jobs is confidence, without which it is very difficult to have investment growth. The factors that can help engender that confidence include balancing public accounts, developing the internal market, and good coordination in the Member States’ economic policies and in economic and monetary policy. Much has been done already, but much remains to be done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Job creation should be a priority for a number of reasons. Firstly, because unemployment discourages people and makes them stop believing in themselves and in others. It is also the biggest factor in social exclusion. Job creation is the only way of preventing young Europeans wasting their opportunities and talents.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet there are other reasons why job creation remains necessary in Europe, the most important of which relates to the financial sustainability of social protection. It is indisputably true that it will eventually be impossible to maintain the systems we have inherited if we are incapable of creating more jobs. Remedying this situation entails reform in many fields of the social economic systems of the various Member States. These are necessary reforms, not on account of any kind of accommodation with liberalisation theories that see the market as the solution to all evils. These reforms are urgently required and are justified in the name of the values that lie at the heart of the European project that they seek to preserve and to leave for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The extent to which European labour markets are able to respond to the challenges of globalisation, of the technological revolution and of the ageing population continues to be a key issue, despite the positive progress that has been made in the past two years.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we cannot afford to be complacent that the unemployment rate is currently reduced. The Lisbon Strategy calls for both more and better quality jobs. Currently, the concept of ‘flexicurity’ is seen as a threat by many millions of our fellow citizens. It means for them and their families ever-greater insecurity. The Commission’s proposal on the employment guidelines notes this, saying: ‘a more comprehensive approach is necessary, better combining flexibility and security’. That is often repeated, but in reality things are getting worse, not better.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its Green Paper on modernising labour law, the Commission highlights some of the issues ‘through non-standard contracts, businesses seek to remain competitive in the global economy by avoiding the cost of compliance with employment protection, notice periods and the cost of social security contributions’. That does not sound to me like the path toward competing through quality and high added value in a globalised world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also notes that fixed-term, part-time, on-call and zero-hour contracts, contracts for workers from temporary employment agencies, freelance contracts, etc. have become an established feature of European labour markets. It notes that they are on the increase, up 4% between 2001 and 2005, and show that a significant minority, round about 16%, remain trapped in a succession of short-term low-quality jobs, with inadequate social protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thankfully, we now have directives covering part-time and fixed-term contract workers. But those initiatives date from a time when the Commission still believed it had a role to play in establishing minimum standards, when it believed in using the legal bases available to it. But what about those other proliferating forms of insecure, low-paid, low-quality, atypical jobs? The best the Commission can do nowadays is to ask a series of rhetorical questions in its Green Paper on how to rebalance ‘flexicurity’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well, maybe it is time the Commission returned to a social agenda with legislative content; a signal is desperately needed to the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is an important debate on two very important reports, but it is an issue which the House has been covering both earlier today and indeed yesterday.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier today we voted through by a large majority a resolution in relation to the Lisbon Strategy regarding the Spring Council. It covered growth, employment, competitiveness; it was an important statement of what needed to be done and how to get here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday there were other important statements. Commission President Barroso reminded us that EU institutions had to focus on citizens’ priorities; that we cannot build tomorrow’s Europe with yesterday’s tools; that we needed change. Chancellor Merkel, on behalf of the Council Presidency, said to loud applause that we needed less bureaucracy, not more; that better and simplified regulation was the direction to follow; and she urged the Parliament to back this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">With our resolution today we have formally given this backing. But I do wish that this might mean that here, across all political groups and indeed within political groups, the old argument that we can either have more competitiveness or more social justice could be seen as an old argument. The reality is that they are two sides of the same coin. The biggest social injustice of all, as several colleagues have mentioned, is that which is inflicted on those millions still unemployed who want to work but cannot find a job. This is not just their problem, it is our shame.</p>
      <p sl="en">MEPs should no longer be seen in two camps, either on the side of employers or on the side of employees. Let us please all agree to be in the same camp on the side of employment – of more jobs. That remains the priority of all our citizens. So let us not just give the Council Presidency and the Commission our backing for their agenda, let us make it our job to work together to deliver it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report makes it a good day for Parliament for a number of reasons. First of all, the inseparable links between economic, social and environmental policy have, as has already been pointed out, gone beyond the level of trite statements and can now be seen in practice. We need only compare the title and the content to appreciate this shift. The report states quite plainly how long this has been on the books of the Community institutions. The economic policy guidelines need to include the social and environmental dimensions, in the sense that these are the most important aspects of them. It is not just a case of combining three equivalent areas in the best way possible, but of recognising that economic development is based on social cohesion and environmental alertness.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, since competitiveness requires compatibility, action is needed in specific sectors, such as research and development, energy and the environment, as well as equally specific objectives for creating full employment and good quality jobs, guaranteeing dignity and security for people in work, and addressing calls for flexibility from both sides of the employer-worker relationship by means of measures aiming not just at conciliation but also at worker redeployment.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, since the coordination method can provide useful results, it is not only good practice that should be pointed out and exchanged, but also obstacles, difficulties and adverse outcomes. Great care is always needed when going down the road of harmonisation, since it is important to take account of contexts and legal systems; they may appear similar, but they retain their own peculiarities. However, understanding not only the proposal but also the implementation procedure and the impact caused will facilitate everybody’s work at European, national and regional levels.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final reason is that national decisions must in turn follow an integrated, cross-cutting approach, and the prearranged plans and priorities must be reflected in the national budgets.</p>

      <p sl="es">The representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs in 't Veld, began her speech by saying that Mr Bullmann’s report was a good report, as previous reports on the broad economic guidelines had also been, but that those fine words had not been turned into concrete action, that we have never been able to move beyond the talking stage.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the short space of time available to me, I am going to focus on the institutional reforms. A period of reflection on the Constitutional Treaty has been opened up and is now on the point of being concluded, and practically everybody has expressed their opinion. Mrs Merkel is proposing a roadmap; the Socialist candidate Ségolène Royal, to question the role of the Central Bank; the presidential candidate Sarkozy, the reforms that need to be introduced in order to make the Treaty viable. Everybody talks about this issue apart from us.</p>
      <p sl="es">I know that Mr Almunia believes that the great economic Treaty was Maastricht, and that may be true, but in Marxist terms, what Maastricht did was change the economic structures.</p>
      <p sl="es">It now falls to us to change the political superstructures, to bring the institutional architecture into line with these changes. I would propose that Parliament become involved and produce a few lines on what the Commissioner, from his vantage point, believes should be introduced in the Constitutional Treaty. An exercise of this kind was carried out in Group VI in the European Convention that failed, but the list remains in force. What are our views about what should be done on the Union's list of economic objectives? How do we believe, and how far do we believe, the codecision procedure should be extended in the field of economic policies? What should we do about the power of retrieval in the Lamfalussy procedure? How can we guarantee the democratic control of the European Central Bank without undermining its independence? What should we do about economic governance (this morning, the Italian President, Mr Napolitano, referred to the need for greater economic coordination)? What should the President-in-Office of the Council do? Here we are still saying nothing though.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the area of taxation, and I shall end here, all we need to do is incorporate into the Treaty what jurisprudence has already said, a single definition of tax domicile, an agreement on double taxation, the application of the non-discrimination principle, and I shall not go on because my time has run out.</p>
      <p sl="es">What I propose, Mr Almunia, is that you produce a few lines and bring it to that dialogue that we approved in previous broad economic guidelines, and that we reach agreement so that we can speak with one voice and make constructive proposals in this reform of the Constitutional Treaty, because tomorrow it will be too late.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the broad economic policy guidelines could be described as a moral, or regulatory, framework for the Member States, since economic policy is a matter for the Member States but our objectives are pan-European. This tension characterises all our debates. Those failing to comply with the broad economic policy guidelines undermine and endanger European economic policy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we are seeing a welcome development in economic policy, one that will provide the scope and tailwind for us to apply ourselves to our policy objectives and the necessary reform measures more actively, proactively and courageously than without the economic upswing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, there is no contradiction between the tasks of utilising the internal market, pursuing the Lisbon objectives, complying with the Stability and Growth Pact and meeting the challenge of the consequences of demographic developments. On the contrary, all these measures must be taken if we are to realise the EU’s broad economic policy guidelines and their objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I say that it is not true what is often bandied about in election campaigns: that the independence of the European Central Bank – as the French believe – or the objectives of the EU are the cause of national problems. Instead, it is the failure to meet these objectives that is causing growth and employment problems at national level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us use the time at our disposal to apply ourselves more actively to our objectives and our agreed policy reforms. Let us reform our social security systems so that we are able to meet the challenge of globalisation. Let us make energy efficiency and the strengthening of innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises the model for the European Economic Area, and let us improve economic policy structures – let us make savings to give ourselves scope for the investment needed – to make ourselves sustainably competitive at global level.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks for this stimulating debate. The positive data reported in various fields are of course welcome, yet we must not rest on our laurels on this account – further action is needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Various arguments have also been put forward as to the EU’s position on, for example, the issue of employment and economic policies – focusing on the Lisbon process. It was also important to mention that competition and jobs were joined by sustainability in Gothenburg. The Spring European Council due to be held in a few days’ time will address an issue that intersects with the field of jobs – namely that of energy.</p>
      <p sl="de">This issue involves, on the one hand, energy as a product and, on the other hand, the question of how to deal with energy in future. Can alternative forms be found? How can new fields be developed in this regard? After all, this is not something dreamed up by one party or another; it has become clear that the promotion of renewable energies represents an important element.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to state on behalf of the Presidency that what is equally important – and Franz Müntefering, the President of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, held a meeting on this issue just last week, in Nuremburg in Bavaria – is how Europe can continue to incorporate the social dimension. What challenges are to be met? How can we show that Europe does not represent a threat, but rather an answer to the challenge of globalisation and the issue of maintaining the social security system?</p>
      <p sl="de">These are very important points, which we shall also pursue within the framework of the G8. I have already given my assurances that, in terms of not only the dialogue, the Troika, but also of the issue as to how Commission, Council and Parliament deal with each other in order to stay in close contact on this, we are pursuing the same objectives.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-316" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">I would like to begin by once again thanking the two rapporteurs and everybody who has been involved in the drawing up of these reports and this afternoon’s debate — which I believe has been extremely illuminating — on the situation we are experiencing and the challenges we need to face.</p>
      <p sl="es">The situation — to use a Castilian figure of speech, though I believe that similar expressions are used in the few languages that I know of other countries of the Union – can be defined optimistically as a half-full bottle, or, if not pessimistically, then at least if we are to place the emphasis on what still needs to be done, as a half-empty bottle.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the beginning of the debate, some of you asked me, ‘Is the growth we are seeing cyclical or does it also have structural components?’, ‘Will the improvement in employment just be temporary for as long as the economic expansion lasts or is it true that we are achieving a better combination of economic efficiency, more employment and greater social cohesion?’ I believe that it is a combination of the two elements.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the structural reforms that have been carried out over recent years, together with the budgetary discipline and the macroeconomic policies, the mix of macroeconomic policies implemented since the launch of the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union, are beginning to bear fruit. I believe that it is right that the European citizens should be aware that we are beginning to harvest that fruit, that the economic growth of close to 3%, the two million jobs created last year, the twelve million jobs created in the euro zone since 1 January 1999, the very good economic results of the huge majority of the new Member States, the greater consumer confidence and the increase in investment are linked to the efforts and decisions of recent years. It is not merely a matter of chance. Otherwise, how can we expect the citizens to believe us and support us when we say to them, ‘Look, we have to carry on with our efforts’?</p>
      <p sl="es">We have to carry on improving the functioning of the markets in products, goods and services. We have to carry on integrating Europe’s financial systems. We have to carry on improving the quality of legislation in order to create a favourable environment for small and medium-sized businesses so that they can compete without any administrative burden, without a series of obstacles preventing them from moving forward. We need to provide good arguments so that we can ask workers to allow the improvement in the functioning of the labour markets to go ahead. Only by making that effort will we genuinely be able to offer high-quality jobs, a future for coming generations and a combination of environmental policies to combat climate change and energy policies that are capable of improving our competitiveness. Only by doing that will we be able to offer that result.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the Lisbon Strategy reforms, which we must continue, call for effort and responsibility on the part of the European Institutions and the Member States, of the public institutions and of the public sector, and the citizens and companies in the private sector, but they also need to be based on certain steps forward that we are already taking and which must be demonstrated.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the European institutions should draw up policies pessimistically and with the feeling that the future will be worse than the past, because if we do, if that is the only message the European institutions send out, the citizens will wonder what they want Europe for. Europe is the best instrument available to us in the 21st century, as the Lisbon Strategy stated from the outset, for making economic dynamism compatible with social cohesion and solidarity with future generations in terms of sustainability, with the elderly, with the environment and with future generations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to comment briefly on two aspects that have been raised in the debate. Firstly, the coordination of economic policies. If I remember rightly, the Messina Declaration back in 1955 — since we are now talking about the Berlin Declarations as if they are similar to the Messina Declaration — talked about the need to coordinate economic policies, but to that end, Mr García-Margallo, there is no need for you to give a humble Commissioner a mandate to become the next European Convention. What we need to do is to discuss the stability and convergence programmes in depth, as the Commission and the Ecofin Council are currently doing. What we need to do is to discuss the application of the national Lisbon reform programmes and the Community Lisbon Strategy in depth, as the Spring European Council is going to do, to discuss how to draw up a common energy policy that is compatible with an ambitious European environmental programme. We need to carry on integrating financial services, to carry on improving our internal market, which, as some of you have said, still provides Europe with an excellent tool for confronting globalisation with optimism. Furthermore — and this is more a job for national governments than for European directives, given the way things are — we need to improve the functioning of the labour markets, combining flexibility and security, because if there is no security for workers, there will be no flexibility in employment, and if there is no flexibility in companies, there will be no jobs for workers.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that that is the message that emerges from this debate, and the Commission is entirely in agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Within the framework of the recent socio-economic developments in the Union and even if unemployment figures seem to decrease, genuine and thorough attention should still be given to social cohesion in the Union as a whole. As a matter of fact, despite the increase in employment data, poverty is still growing in the eurozone and part of the jobs that are created are unfortunately of a precarious nature. Quality and secure employment should go along with economic growth through the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives. With the increasing disparities between the growth rates of the Member States and the relatively low growth rates of certain large Member States, significant efforts are needed in order to enable the Union to face the new challenges of an ageing population and growing competition as a result of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Bullmann report, by focusing on the role of SMEs, research and development, the environment and the energy sector, aims clearly at creating greater coherence in the policy-making processes and the economic governance of the Union while attempting to develop a genuinely effective and inclusive European labour market. I therefore support the line adopted by the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Is the Council currently examining any kind of analysis or proposals with a view to considering, during the next presidency, the urgent need to review the role of the European Central Bank, especially with regard to the revision of its objectives, in order to give priority to employment and sustained economic growth, while also re-examining its decision-making processes and powers, which should not be beyond the reach of the options of the Member States' governments and parliaments?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I can answer the question as follows. The objectives of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are laid down in Article 105 of the EC Treaty. The main purpose of the provision is the maintenance of price stability. Apart from this objective, however, the ESCB supports the general economic policies of the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the Community’s objectives pursuant to Article 2 EC. The ESCB acts in accordance with the principles of a market economy and free competition. This includes, in particular, the effective allocation of resources in compliance with the principles of the EC Treaty. The provisions of Article 107(5) EC may be amended by the Council acting by a qualified majority; that is, acting either by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the European Central Bank (ECB) and after consulting the Commission or unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB. In either case, the assent of the European Parliament is required. Since, however, Article 105 EC mentioned at the beginning is not among the provisions listed in Article 107(5), it can be amended only using the general Treaty amendment procedure pursuant to Article 48 TEU. The Council is not currently dealing with any proposals to this effect.</p>

      <p sl="de">When the European Central Bank was established, we laid down an important principle: that of the independence of the Central Bank. Its job is to assess, on the basis of various indicators, how to regulate the money market at the end of the day, including in the matter of interest-rate increases. This means that there is no way the Council or a Member State can influence monetary policy.</p>

The purpose of the Conference was to strengthen cooperation in the spirit of partnership in these fields, which are of vital importance to both sides, and also to decide on joint action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Medina Ortega, a whole package of measures was discussed at the Conference in Tripoli, since we take the view that the migration problem cannot be solved by a single proposal or solution, and that a series of measures is needed. The issue of legal migration was also discussed, including various points relating to the feasibility of addressing this aspect. Equally, however, the Conference addressed the feasibility of Africans who live in Europe – in the Diaspora, as they see it – returning to their home countries for a given period to help with the development of education systems and with job creation, for example. It also discussed the possibility of reducing the cost of money transfers to these countries. For example, it could happen that, out of EUR 1 000 remitted to a country, only EUR 800 reaches the recipient since the charges are so high. A whole package of measures was discussed with the countries of the African Union plus Morocco, therefore. Furthermore, discussions are continuing on what possibilities the EU and the African countries could open up for temporary employment in Europe, for example.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, another of the objectives of this Conference was undoubtedly to discuss ways of reducing the causes of migration; that is, to take the relevant preventive action. There are good examples of where such action has been very effective, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. There, European police units have provided assistance in the field of legal education and the military field, resulting in the development of the rule of law, with a view to achieving greater stability and enabling economic investment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Pirker, back in July, a Conference was held in Rabat: not one entitled ‘EU–Africa’, but one initiated by Morocco, Spain and France. This addressed the West African migration route. It became clear at the Tripoli Conference, however, that there is a further African route, the East–West route, that should also be the focus of our attention.</p>
      <p sl="de">To return to your specific question, however, there are indeed examples of successful action. Another important thing that this Conference needed to make clear was that one way of tackling the causes is through ‘best governance’, by the Government choosing a form of governance that gives its citizens the chance to become involved in the generation and sale of raw materials and in education.</p>
      <p sl="de">The obligation of the EU – the Member States – to offer assistance in the field of administration and of police and judiciary systems, where this is requested, was also emphasised. A few years ago, in the course of various debates in Europe, ‘best practices’ were discussed – that is, looking at what one’s neighbours are doing successfully – and this concept could certainly be transferred to certain African countries. This kind of comprehensive approach was discussed, and it is now up to us to decide what action to take in the various fields – although I have to say that not all measures are needed in all cases, as some countries have already made very great progress thanks to domestic developments. However, the EU did give assurances of its support and solidarity on this.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, Malta is the country that has suffered the most as a result of illegal migration from Africa. Several nations, mine among them, in the name of solidarity with Malta, have invited illegal migrants to come to our countries legalising their status at the same time. Is it the view of the Minister that this will have a positive effect, or will it adversely affect the illegal migration situation?</p>

      <p sl="de">The important thing – as Mr Pirker has just mentioned – is to address the causes of this migration. Solutions must be found to these. There will always be migration, for various reasons, but, in many regions, the reason is the lack of prospects there. That is why we have to address the first point; that is, to eliminate the causes of migration in these countries. There are various other fields in addition to this, which have just been mentioned: such as exploring how to enable those wanting to work in Europe for a fixed period to do so legally, and how they can start work. Finally, we must look into how to integrate people seeking employment or trying to make a living here. The most important point, however, is the first approach, namely obviating the need for flight on account of economic pressures or, as is sometimes the case, of human rights violations.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 3 by Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (H-1056/06)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Demographic developments in Europe</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the light of the demographic changes in Europe and the growing interest expressed by the European Union in resolving the demographic problem, will the German Presidency say whether it intends to draw up a European Pact on the quality of family life, along the lines of the European Youth Pact (22-23 March 2005) and the European Gender Equality Pact (23-24 March 2006)?</p>

      <p sl="de">Demographic change in Europe concerns all the Member States of the EU. A major feature is the low or even falling birth rates throughout Europe. The changing demographic of nations necessitates comprehensive structural changes as part of a long-term strategy if the social cohesion of the generations and the competitiveness of the European economy are to be preserved.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its Communication entitled ‘The demographic future of Europe – from challenge to opportunity’ of 12 October of last year, the European Commission notes that Europe has never in its history experienced economic growth without population growth. In this light, confronting the demographic challenge with the help of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs takes on particular importance.</p>
      <p sl="de">A priority for the German Council Presidency in this regard is enabling men and women wishing to start a family to do so with the help of family-friendly policies. Experience in a number of Member States has shown that political measures are possible as well as necessary. There should be a European ‘alliance for the family’ to serve as a platform for Member States to exchange views and experiences. Its field of competence should include key tasks relating to the management of demographic change.</p>
      <p sl="de">This alliance should also actively involve the social partners, civil society and representatives of science and industry. The key objective of the alliance should be to offer support to the Member States through this ongoing exchange. The intention is that, by the end of the German Presidency, not only will the political starting signal have been fired, but also the first tangible steps will have been taken towards the realisation of this alliance. In so doing, the idea is to utilise existing resources and to tie in with existing structures; the European Demographic Forums launched by the Commission in its Communication will be particularly important reference points in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Commission has already set up a high-level group on demography and the family. The alliance will complement the comprehensive initiatives at European level for the promotion of gender equality, particularly the European Pact for Gender Equality and the Commission’s Roadmap for equality between men and women 2006–10.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only an improvement in the reconciliation of family and career will enable men and women to decide to have more children without giving up their careers. The Member States must work together with the social partners and individual companies on reducing pay inequality and on supporting parents in the early stages of bringing up their child.</p>
      <p sl="de">After all, an improvement in the reconciliation of family and career is another chief objective of the European Pact for Youth, with a view to giving young people access to vocational and social integration.</p>

      <p sl="el">However, I would like you to tell me, as far as the Youth Pact is concerned, which particular actions you are thinking of applying.

There are overlaps, where we see the same trends in different Member States. Here, too, it is primarily a matter of taking stock and of seeing what specific answers can be found.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my answer just now, I mentioned several fields that we wish to develop in order to bring this issue into even sharper focus, several of which concern young people. In the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the following questions arise. How do we ensure that young people find a vocational training place or job? What prejudices are there in society, for example against young people from migrant backgrounds? These are all issues we hope to discuss at various conferences this year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if we want to see a sensible demographic trend in Europe, we must at any rate stop clinging to our ideologically skewed, hypocritical blinkers and dreaming of a model of life that existed perhaps 200 years ago. Children are brought to life not only within traditional families, but also within other models of life. We have an example of favourable demographic trends here in the EU – in France – as childcare places there are sufficient and affordable. I should be interested to hear what the President-in-Office is planning in this connection.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Leichtfried, many thanks for your supplementary question. Here, too, we can pick up the thread of previous discussions at Spring Summits, where the generation of investment in the Member States to enable the reconciliation of family and career has been mentioned. A number of aspects should certainly be considered in this regard. A key point, however, is that people have been singling out France and other Member States that are enjoying certain successes. I hail from one country where the situation is unsatisfactory, but where attempts are being made to find a solution. It is important not to offer a centralised solution, but instead to be guided by the principle of looking at neighbours who are doing things successfully and seeing how we can implement these accordingly at home. That is the way to finally achieve an outcome different from the one we are seeing now.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Roma rights</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What priority is the Council giving in this European Year of Equal Opportunities for All to addressing urgently the EU's main human rights crisis, which is the discrimination, harassment and violence suffered by its 8 million Roma citizens (and double that in wider Europe), including an alarming increase in forced evictions and a torrent of abuse and prejudice?</p>

    <intervention id="3-346" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Gloser" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="de">The decision to designate 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All was approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2006. The Council agreed that all the types of discrimination stated in Article 13 of the EC Treaty should be covered and addressed equally, including all the groups concerned, by the various measures to be carried out at European and national level.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the negotiations with Parliament, the Council gave its agreement to including an express mention of the Roma population in the Decision establishing the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. The text contains a recital detailing the situation of the Roma in Europe, in which Parliament draws attention to the prevalence of anti-Roma sentiment and its discriminatory effect on the opportunities in terms of employment, education and social services for the European Union’s most disadvantaged ethnic-minority group.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must be borne in mind, however, that the work as part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All 2007 is based on the principles of personal responsibility and subsidiarity. Each Member State is therefore responsible for deciding what measures to carry out in the coming months.</p>

      <p sl="en">Minister, one problem is that evictions and segregation are often condoned or even instigated by local or regional government, and central governments have not been effective in challenging them. Will the Presidency encourage all Member States to do so?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I am not really happy with your reference to subsidiarity. Anti-discrimination legislation is not sufficient to tackle systemic discrimination. There needs to be positive action and proactive measures. In some Member States, public authorities have a positive duty to promote equality. Surely you can encourage all Member States to do that through a process of peer review.</p>

      <p sl="de">Baroness Ludford, on the subject of subsidiarity, Member States do indeed bear responsibility. The large number of progress reports drawn up in the course of the accession of the Eastern European Member States included an examination of the minorities issue from many angles, particularly concerning all aspects of the situation of the Roma. It is always important to bear that in mind. On the other hand, there is also scope for establishing programmes to promote the integration of the Roma population, including with the involvement of the World Bank. I believe that this is an issue that cannot be solved by the respective Member States alone, and that the integration of these sections of the population requires assistance from others.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President-in-Office, I have a question on this subject. We agree that non-discrimination is a question of time. In my home country, authorities operating not at national but at lower level are currently endeavouring to impose bans on begging, for example.

      <p sl="de">The EU emissions trading scheme is one of the most important policy instruments at the disposal of the European Community and its Member States for achieving their Kyoto objectives in the most cost-effective way. As the honourable Member will be aware, Directive 2003/87/EC obliges Member States to publish their national allocation plans. They have to notify these to the Commission and to the other Member States at least 18 months before the beginning of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, namely 2008–2012. The Commission has evaluated the Member States’ national allocation plans. The Presidency will continue reviewing this EU emissions trading scheme on the basis of the Commission Communication, which identifies the priority issues. The Presidency will also follow up the proposal to bring aviation into this scheme. The Presidency is working towards ensuring that the emissions trading scheme makes the expected contribution to the achievement of the Kyoto objectives, and is working to improve and extend this EU scheme with a view to establishing a global carbon market that leads to the emission reductions needed to tackle climate change.</p>

      <p sl="en">No one doubts the Council’s determination on the question of the emissions trading scheme. No one doubts the good news that we have heard recently. The question that EU citizens are asking, though, is what is the incentive mechanism for really making this work? This is an enormous project, and what during the German Presidency would be the scope for further incentives to encourage Member States to hit the targets and indeed oblige them to meet these targets, now that European Union citizens truly believe that something is on the move here and there is something very positive?</p>

In addition to a preliminary assessment of the impact of the rising number of public debates and deliberations on the effectiveness of the Council’s work, the report contains data on the number of visits to the new Council video streaming website and to the website providing access to Council documents relating to public deliberations or debates. In the first four-and-a-half months of the new transparency measures alone, over 28 000 visits to these new features of the Council website were recorded. These figures document the positive response of the public and the media to the new transparency measures. The webcast and the online availability of documents relating to public sessions have thus considerably improved opportunities for following the debates and decision-making processes in the Council. The Council is constantly striving to improve these features. Concerning the impact of these transparency measures on the effectiveness of the Council’s work, it should be borne in mind that, at the time of the initial evaluation, which the European Council had called for in June 2006, the new rules had been in operation for less than six months, including the month of August. This means that it was, and still is, too early to issue a definitive evaluation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Posselt, my answer to your question is as follows. Martti Ahtisaari’s endeavours have the unqualified support of the EU. The strategic objective in this regard is still to achieve a lasting settlement for Kosovo quickly without endangering democracy in Serbia or the stability of the region as a whole. The EU is currently working on plans for three projects. These are the international civilian mission (ICM), a rule of law mission and programmes for continuing the promotion of economic development and furthering Kosovo’s prospects of EU membership. In all three cases, the plans are being made in close cooperation with the local authorities and other international actors, particularly the United States and NATO.</p>
      <p sl="de">The team making preparations for the international civilian mission started work in Priština on 9 October 2006. It has the twofold task of planning the structure and staffing of the mission and determining its infrastructure requirements and, together with UNMIK and the competent Kosovo authorities, preparing the possible transfer of competences to both the ICM and the local authorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since May 2006, a Planning Team has been in Kosovo to prepare a possible rule of law mission within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The planned mission is intended to have a general role in teaching, observing and advising in matters of the rule of law. In addition, it would have executive powers in some fields relating to the police, the judiciary and customs. The precise scope of its mandate will have to be established after the resolution of the status issue. The mission, which would be introduced following the conclusion of the status process and a transitional period where it worked jointly with UNMIK, would be the largest civilian ESDP mission to date.</p>
      <p sl="de">A successful conclusion of the status process, which is being led by Mr Ahtisaari, is essential not only to give the people of Kosovo clear prospects, but also for stability in the whole region. The conclusion of this process represents the end point in the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President-in-Office, many thanks for that very good, precise reply. The longer the settlement of the status issue is delayed, the greater the risk of instability in Kosovo – and this, in turn, could be used to effect the partition of Kosovo after all, even through the back door. My question is a specific one: could a more intensive international and EU presence – in terms of both civilian and military forces – perhaps be envisaged for, say, potential crisis regions such as Mitrovica; one far exceeding the present dimensions and along the lines of what was seen in Vukovar?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Posselt, you speak of delays and the potential risks these entail. It is very important that we have stated that a solution is needed – and the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed this very intensively on Monday.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is nothing in the Council Conclusions to indicate that things are being put off indefinitely. On the contrary, we have used the opinions voiced – including on the occasion of the EU Troika meeting in Belgrade – as an opportunity to say that a new parliament is indeed emerging from the democratic forces, that a new government will also be formed; and that we have to give these a while longer to enable the appointment of the new negotiating team so that it can join the negotiations. The Council has been conscious that we cannot let the whole process start again from scratch, however, as the timing is indeed important if we are to avoid the instability you mention. For this reason, I do not wish to speculate at this time on other things that may or may not happen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Minister, you say that EU Foreign Ministers want to avoid indefinite delay, but there is some concern that the Ahtisaari status mission risks being somewhat drawn out. Do not last Saturday’s regrettable deaths at a demonstration attended by, we understand, 3 000 people – and I would say ‘only’ 3 000 people – call into question the expertise and competence of the policing of demonstrations and make rather urgent a better management of this situation so that things do not get out of control?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Mr Gloser, I think that the business of giving Kosovo de facto independence will prove to be one of the international community’s biggest challenges in the next couple of months, and one in which the European Union will need to play an important role. You yourself talked about the international civil mission, the civil branch of the European defence and security policy. The figures I hear being bandied around suggest that 71 officials will be attached to the international civil mission and some one thousand more to the European Union to work on European defence and security policy.

The resources necessary for this mission are considerable and will constitute a large part of our budget.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: House of Lords, 50th Report, 'Financial Management and Fraud in the European Union: Perceptions, Facts and Proposals' (published on 13 November 2006)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On page 47 (para. 172) of its above-mentioned report, the United Kingdom House of Lords states the following: ‘We consider that the Budget Council should be at least as concerned with the Union's accounts as it is with drawing up the Budget. We therefore consider that the Budget Council should prepare a report on the annual audit and Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors. This would be debated by the European Parliament at the same time as the Court of Auditor's report.’</p>

      <p sl="de">The Council attaches very great importance to the annual audit and Statement of Assurance of the Court of Auditors and has repeatedly affirmed its unwavering support for sound financial management in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Following a detailed examination of the annual report of the European Court of Auditors by the appropriate Council bodies, the Council sends Parliament a recommendation on discharge pursuant to Article 276(1) of the EC Treaty for each financial year. This recommendation on discharge contains the extensive conclusions of the Council on the Court of Auditors’ annual report, in which the Council addresses, in detail, the observations of the Court of Auditors and the Commission’s opinions on these.</p>
      <p sl="de">The conclusions also contain recommendations to the Commission and the Member States for eliminating any shortcomings or weaknesses discovered. These Council conclusions are debated by Parliament at the same time as the Court of Auditors’ annual report as part of the discharge procedure. It does not seem appropriate to introduce another Council report – which would of necessity have largely the same content – in addition to these detailed conclusions.</p>

The national declaration of assurance is also excluded here, however.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are confronted with a dramatic humanitarian, security and political problem in Darfur today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation on the ground is deteriorating by the day. The number of civilians affected by the conflict has risen to almost four million since 2003. Throughout 2006 we saw an increase in the number of violent deaths in Darfur. Attacks on humanitarian aid agencies also significantly increased and this has prompted some organisations to evacuate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Continued violations of the ceasefire by both the Sudanese Government and the rebel factions deepen insecurity and instability. Most recently, on Monday, Sudanese military forces bombarded Cariari and Bahai, two villages in north Darfur close to the Chad-Sudan border.</p>
      <p sl="en">The African Union Mission to Sudan – established in 2004 to help prevent further conflict – continues to face resource constraints. Despite its best efforts, it had some difficulty in providing effective protection to civilians or carrying out additional duties associated with the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement. Politically, the situation is complicated by splits and regrouping among the non-signatory rebel movements as well as the Government’s refusal to consider reopening the deadlocked Peace Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Darfur is not a simple issue. The commitment of the European Union to alleviating such a dramatic situation has been reiterated on several occasions, most recently at the European Council last December, at the Council on 22 January and, just two days ago, through the General Affairs Council conclusions on Sudan of 12 February. We must work to ensure the protection of non-combatants as well as of humanitarian aid workers. We must seek the full implementation of the UN-AU three phase plan for Darfur, this being the most effective means at our disposal to support the African Union mission in Sudan and to protect civilians.</p>
      <p sl="en">But our overriding objective in Darfur must be to achieve a durable peace through a political settlement agreed by all parties voluntarily and then implemented. The strategy of Khartoum to negotiate individually with each rebel leader to buy their support will not create a cohesive and lasting peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council of the EU, in its latest conclusions on Sudan, has emphasised the need for an inclusive political process and confirmed its support for the joint initiative of the African Union and UN special envoys to start negotiations between the parties as soon as possible. On several occasions and in various fora, the Commission has stressed the need for a political solution in Darfur based on the existing peace agreement and insisted that there is no military solution to the crisis. In this context, the European Commission has strongly backed the African Union in the search for a political settlement in Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been providing continued support to the African Union in political and financial terms. With cofinancing from Belgium, the Commission stands behind any and all efforts to revive the peace agreement. The European Commission has provided one and a half billion euros specifically for the Darfur crisis, covering security, humanitarian needs and peace efforts for Darfur. The aim is to create the conditions to bring the non-signatory parties of the Darfur Peace Agreement back to the negotiating table and to start effective implementation of the Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pending a lasting settlement, the Commission is also active in the political démarche intended to obtain the agreement of the Khartoum Government to a joint AU-UN force capable of providing effective protection of civilians. In the margins of the African Union Summit on 28 January, Commissioner Michel met with the Sudanese President, Mr al-Bashir, as well as with the UN Secretary-General Mr Ban Ki-Moon. The Commissioner was also in Ethiopia and in Eritrea where the Darfur issue was raised. Just yesterday, the Darfur issue was discussed in Washington in a meeting between Commissioner Michel and the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Parliament is right to debate the Darfur Peace Agreement and the critical situation in Darfur. Yet we must not take the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for granted. EU Heads of Mission in Khartoum report that this peace agreement, made in 2005 with the south, is in trouble. After 20 years of civil war the comprehensive peace agreement may be the last chance for the Khartoum regime to show that the federal power-sharing form of government can work for this vast country. If the Comprehensive Peace Agreement cannot work, then nor can the Darfur Peace Agreement. It is important, I think, that the critical situation in Darfur does not divert our attention, or indeed the attention of the Sudanese regime, from the very real threat to the whole sub-region if both the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the Darfur Peace Agreement are not pursued with more vigour. This is a message that the Commission will strive to communicate in the weeks ahead.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Council released its conclusions on Sudan on Monday, so it is appropriate that Parliament also speaks out strongly this week, further highlighting the humanitarian crisis and international scandal that is Darfur. We are attempting to raise the political temperature on this issue to increase the pressure on those who can, if the will exists, make things happen on the ground to protect people.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all know the figures and the scale of the humanitarian consequences of insufficient action by the international community. It is estimated that up to 400 000 people have been killed and more than two and a half million people displaced or made homeless in the last three years due to conflict. NGOs currently provide humanitarian relief for up to four million people. That is half of Darfur’s entire population. In recent months there have been repeated attacks on humanitarian convoys and twelve aid workers have been killed in Darfur in the last six months.</p>
      <p sl="de">So NGOs are pulling their people out of Darfur while indiscriminate attacks continue on civilians. So what can we do? The main thrust of this resolution is to call on the UN to set a clear date for deployment of the planned UN-supported peacekeeping force, or hybrid force, into Darfur, even in the absence of agreement with the Sudanese Government, in order to secure humanitarian aid corridors to an increasingly isolated population in the region.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are calling for this in the context of the UN’s responsibility to protect, based on the failure of the Sudanese Government to protect its own population from war crimes and crimes against humanity, and a failure to provide humanitarian assistance to the population. President al-Bashir continues to oppose Phase 3 of the present UN Plan which allows the AU mission to be bolstered by more than 20 000 UN peacekeeping troops.</p>
      <p sl="de">The point is, diplomacy is failing. People are dying in huge numbers and at some point the international community is obliged to act more firmly. That is why the setting of a clear date for the deployment of troops will focus the attention on a tight timescale to find a diplomatic solution to get peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Darfur has been suffering under a regime of terror for four years now. Hundreds of thousands of people there have lost their lives, two million have lost their homes, and rape, murder and pillaging are daily occurrences there. It is nearly impossible to really grasp the extent of this suffering. Meanwhile, despite all the fine agreements, human rights violations get increasingly out of hand. Over the past few months, the situation has hit an all-time low for both the people and aid workers. Despite the Peace Agreement concluded in early January, large parts of North Darfur were deliberately bombarded recently by the Sudanese air force. Even the aid workers are no longer safe from violence, aid organisations increasingly feel it. Last month, 15 UN organisations, including UNICEF, reported that they were no longer able to keep on providing aid to the people in Darfur in an adequate manner. Two weeks ago, the aid organisation Médicins du Monde was the first to withdraw, and Oxfam and CARE International are at risk of having to follow suit, even though three and a half million Darfuris rely on humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Council is not present today. How long do we intend to perpetuate this untenable situation? The UN may be speaking with force in its resolution, but it has not done much in the way of action. The peace force that was promised two months ago in Addis Ababa produced some 100 troops and very little else. The UN Security Council authorised sanctions against four major perpetrators of atrocities, but nothing happened. It is unacceptable for European Member States to be able to impose sanctions on war criminals in countries such as Belarus, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, North Korea, Burma and Zimbabwe and to fail to do so in Darfur, where the Council is neglecting its humanitarian duty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The international community should no longer stand by helplessly while millions of innocent people are being driven away from their homes, murdered and raped. Europe should take the lead and take urgent action in order to stop the humanitarian crisis in Darfur in its tracks. The Sudanese Government will be prepared to conclude real peace agreements and adhere to them only if its own interests are affected, for the only language it understands is its own, that of the fist. In southern Sudan, an oil boycott proved effective, and I would urge Members belonging to the other political parties to apply the same tactics if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to ask the Council whether it is prepared, without delay, to declare sanctions against anyone who violates the ceasefire or who attacks citizens, peace keepers or aid workers. Would it be prepared to do everything necessary to stop them getting away with it and, once and for all, to enforce and implement the sanctions agreed upon in the Security Council? Is it prepared to enforce the presence of the hybrid peace force of African Union soldiers and blue helmets?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Would it, finally, be prepared to apply economic sanctions, including the introduction of an oil embargo? We did not intervene when the genocide in Rwanda took place, and watched helplessly as the men in Srebrenica met their fate, even though the UN was set up in 1945 in order to reinforce our promise of ‘never again’. We should not leave the powerless to their fate. I hope that Europe wants to make a difference. I am, above all, addressing the Council, which is absent, and the Commissioner, whom I would like to urge to take action.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague, Mr Morillon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must begin by highlighting the entirely surreal nature of our meeting this evening. There are around ten of us Members present. Commissioner, thank you for being here. I know the reasons for the absence of Mr Michel, whom you are representing. However, the most notable absentee is the Council, and in the meantime, I am afraid to say, people continue to die in Darfur. I would remind you, as a numbers man, Mr Almunia, that fourteen or fifteen people die every hour in Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was therefore high time we worried about a situation that no one believes is simple. Yet, must we continue making fools of ourselves? This resolution will be the fifth that we have adopted over many months on Darfur: we can see the extent to which they undermine the officials, not least the Sudanese officials received this evening in Paris.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that we could actually finally assume our responsibilities. I must alert you, Commissioner, to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this resolution. As my fellow Member, Mr Coveney, pointed out, paragraph 2 emphasises the need for a precise date to be set by the UN. However, paragraph 3, Commissioner, is an appeal launched at the European Union, with the aim of having it assume its responsibilities. Its assuming its responsibilities will surely mean something in the future. If not, one may wonder about the purpose of the European Union and of the values that we seek to uphold, faced with what is essentially an endless emergency humanitarian situation, something that no one denies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My colleagues have nominated me as permanent rapporteur for humanitarian action. But what should I report on? The systematic withdrawal of all the NGOs, which are no longer allowed to work, the fourteen people who have been killed and the deaths day in, day out of people who have been abandoned and who, in addition to having been displaced, have lost all hope.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, please speak with the Commission on our behalf; we will take care of the Council, politically, because, if we listened to them, we would have to wait a month before discussing this issue. This message needs to be passed on: one day, the law, not to mention the duty to interfere, will be required, when it is clear that men and women are being abused to this extent.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I too should like to highlight the discrepancy between the seriousness of the issue being dealt with and this practically deserted Chamber, and that is without mentioning the absence of the Council; while the Commission is at least represented, our action in relation to this matter is certainly not, in any event, equal to the challenges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I was saying, the Council is absent, but when one reads its conclusions of 12 February, that is to say, those written exactly two days ago, its absence does not change a great deal anyway. I shall read and quote what is written in these conclusions:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘The Council remains gravely concerned about the security situation in Darfur’ – to say the least – ‘and condemns continued ceasefire violations by all parties.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the kind of particularly forceful sentence that the Council is capable of producing after months and months of resolutions, decisions and diplomatic meetings, when the situation is more disastrous now than it ever has been. We therefore clearly believe that a change of level is required and, indeed, that more pressure must be exerted with regard to this unacceptable situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What about the punishments that were decided on for the Sudanese leaders, and for all these war criminals? What is the European Union doing with regard to these punishments? It seems to me, in any case, that the European Union has a number of options available to it to freeze financial resources so as to prevent all these people from moving freely about our territory. Ways of exerting pressure do exist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are we doing with regard to United Nations Resolution 1706, which has the backing of the European Union? What initiatives have been taken by the European Commission and the Council to put pressure on all those responsible for this situation? What credibility do we have today to issue a multitude of texts that, at least on the part of the Council, and even of the Commission, merely restate our grave concerns regarding this situation?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only a very short time ago, the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, visited several African countries and, more specifically, Sudan. What is the Union’s position faced with this situation, with the new and emerging role of China’s leaders? Faced, too, with the importance of access to raw materials, and to oil in particular?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, when one sees the inertia, the powerlessness, of the European institutions on this issue, what conclusions must be drawn? Does this mean that, if priority is to be given to accessing raw materials or oil, which in reality is gradually dwindling, and if it is to be given to the large markets represented by countries such as China, the values of human rights and the duty that we actually have to protect civilian populations need to be put on the back burner? Is that what this means?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that it would be absolutely tragic for the European Union to come to that. The fact is that these issues are being raised on a daily basis, and we constantly find ourselves incapable and powerless in the face of this tragic situation. It is therefore high time a formal sitting bringing together the Council, the Commission and Parliament was organised – and organised very soon – on this issue, in Brussels or Strasbourg, so that the necessary decisions can finally be taken.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can identify with this joint resolution about the international blot – and I should like to underline ‘this international blot’ – being Darfur, despite a few of the comments that have been made. I should like to single out a few elements if I may.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In recital C, it is stated that the conflict in Darfur is increasingly destabilising the Central African region. Less than a week ago, an analysis was published in my home country, the Netherlands, about this very disruptive situation under the telling heading ‘The black hole’. Indeed, there is a black hole at the heart of Africa, rudderless, violent and with a stream of refugees who are headed in all directions. One immediate risk is that the conflict in Darfur, which is racist in that nomads of Arab origin are driving out and killing African farmers, will move to Chad and take the notorious and murderous Janjaweed militia with it. Various paragraphs in the joint resolution urge the United Nations finally to face up to its responsibilities in Darfur. Whilst I can fully endorse this parliamentary cry for help, I have to confess at the same time that I am extremely sceptical as to whether this distress signal will actually be heard in the UN Headquarters in New York.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Earlier this week, Jan Pronk, the former UN envoy to Sudan, gave a frank and honest interview to the Sudan Tribune. He asserted, verbatim , that he accused New York of leaving its own mission in the lurch and, instead, of pandering to the elite in power in Khartoum. It is awful – he said – if you send thousands of people to Sudan and then leave them to their own devices.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What we should, in any case, be doing is to ensure that Mr Pronk's indictment does not fall on deaf ears, but reaches our governments, the European Council and the UN Security Council, and results in action.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also deem as completely appropriate the appeal of this House to the People’s Republic of China to put its not insignificant political and economic weight into the balance in order to try to get the Sudanese leadership to actually enforce existing peace agreements on Khartoum. Only a constructive international stance such as this one is in keeping with Peking's adage of harmonious external relations. Moreover, that is also what we can expect of a strategic partner as a responsible member of the UN Security Council. After all, as rapporteur for EU/China relations, I constantly reminded my esteemed Chinese interlocutors of this elementary constructive international role.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to back the only amendment to the joint resolution – that tabled by Mrs Gomes – and back it all the way. Sanctions against this shameless Sudanese regime should definitely involve an oil embargo, as some sort of acid test to check whether the United Nations, given the long suffering of the people in Darfur, still abides by its own political principles.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the situation in Darfur remains shocking. The response of the international community has been wholly inadequate. The previous speakers have described the situation adequately: there is no improvement in sight for the people there.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some necessary resolutions have been passed, such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706, but their implementation ultimately fails on account of the Government in Khartoum, most of whose leaders are no doubt listed in the files of the International Criminal Court – which launched an investigation into crimes in Darfur as early as June 2005.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a situation where the United Nations has to take action, in accordance with its responsibility for protecting human beings, since the Government of Sudan has not been protecting the people of Darfur against war crimes and crimes against humanity, nor has it lent them any assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, Parliament calls on the United Nations to set a date for the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force pursuant to Article 7 of the Charter of the United Nations, even if this has not been approved by the Khartoum regime. We call on the Council and the Commission to do everything in their power to put an end to this sustained humanitarian disaster.</p>
      <p sl="de">Concrete action can be launched for the short term without great expense. The EU should impose personal sanctions on representatives of the regime unilaterally rather than waiting for the rest of the international community. I have always been in favour of this as a means of preventing family members going on shopping trips to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Darfur regime has thus far been ignoring the no-fly zone imposed by Security Council Resolution 1591, and is continuing to bomb villages in Darfur. We call for the use of capabilities available in the region to enforce this no-fly zone. After all, we know which Member States have aircraft based in the region – not to say the immediate vicinity. Why are these not being used in the services of the UN? The EU must agree to this, at least.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should also give those in power in Khartoum to understand that they should not rely overly on forces outside Africa. The Sudanese Government is skating on very thin ice, and should not exhaust African solidarity. Two warning shots have already been fired. The ACP Summit in Khartoum was the summit attended by the fewest Heads of State or Government – a clear sign of displeasure. The fact that the AU Summit opted for President Kufuor instead of the Sudanese President was a further clear indication of disapproval.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as others have said, as General al-Bashir continues to prevaricate on the deployment of an AU-UN hybrid force in Darfur, we see the humanitarian crisis getting worse. We see the number of internally displaced people increasing. The ceasefire has collapsed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The international community has and is continuing to fail to fulfil its responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Darfur. This means that the European Union must act urgently to impose its own targeted and phased smart sanctions. We do not have to wait for the UN Security Council to agree on essential new measures – as others have suggested – on an arms embargo covering all of Sudan, on asset-freezing of the wealthy people of Sudan, on travel bans and on consideration of an oil embargo.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, revenue flows to the south would need to be protected if we impose an oil embargo, and consideration would perhaps need to be given to compensating the south Sudanese for lost oil revenue. But the least we can do is to put a bar on investments, on technical equipment and on expertise. I also believe that there should be serious consideration of sports sanctions against Sudan, especially consideration of excluding Sudan from the 2010 World Cup. This means that Europe has to put pressure on FIFA.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU position, frankly, is weak and untenable. There is too much emphasis on carrots and not enough on sticks. The German Presidency must take a lead and insist on a unified position from Member States. Commissioner, you have described the position, and in the Council we hear the fine words, but nothing happens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question is: how does Europe put pressure on Khartoum? There must be an urgent and detailed investigation of the personal finances of wealthy individuals in Sudan. We have to prepare the arguments against those who claim that this would push Sudan closer towards Chinese business interests. The truth is, frankly, that nothing is currently influencing Sudan. It is virtually impossible to influence them, and so, if we remain supine, then we maintain the position where they can be as brutal as they like and Europe will continue to do nothing. Millions of people in Darfur are paying for European broken promises and totally worthless commitments. Khartoum knows that Europe is all bark and no bite and that is why today we are calling for new, strong, economic, legal and military measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Public condemnation is not enough. We want solutions which reflect the tragedy. Europe is shamefully weak and I have to say finally that if Darfur was, for example, Lebanon, then real sanctions would be getting a lot more discussion time in the Council, and President Barroso in the Commission and you, Commissioner, would put pressure on the Council to do more.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the humanitarian crisis in Darfur is on a scale which is difficult to comprehend. Two and a half million people have had to flee their homes. That is the equivalent of the entire population of north-east England. The death toll among these displaced people is high and it would be higher by far if it were not for the humanitarian efforts on the ground. But even humanitarian workers cannot operate on a battlefield and unless there is a lessening of hostilities in Darfur it can be expected that more of them will be evacuated. The entire fragile, overstretched humanitarian effort in Darfur could very easily collapse, precipitating hunger and disease in the camps and a rocketing death toll. That is why the stabilising influence of an international peace force is so urgently required. It is also necessary in order to provide calmer conditions in which a political process can get under way, involving all parties and including local low-key intercommunity dialogue as well as high-level, high-profile political negotiation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is certainly significant and worrying that the German Presidency is not here today to represent the Council. This says a great deal about levels of genuine interest and commitment in the new relationship with Africa and in working for development in Africa. Three years ago, I was in Darfur with other MEPs who have spoken or who are about to speak. Since then, the situation has worsened, as Mr Almunia said.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Al-Bashir Government is toying with the international community, with the Security Council, with the European Union and with the African Union, and the EU makes fine statements and does nothing. The time has come for the EU to take action and to exercise its responsibility to protect people. The time has come to impose a no-fly-zone from Chad. The EU can do this, alongside African countries with which it enjoys good relations, and can have an effect on the ground. The time has come, among other things, to impose smart, phased sanctions, travel bans, visa restrictions, and the freezing of assets in banks and elsewhere, and to stop treating Omar Al-Bashir and the members of his government as responsible, respectable leaders. The time has come to impose an effective arms embargo. The time has come to impose other kinds of trade embargo and in particular an oil embargo and on this issue, Mr President, the EU must speak frankly with China, because China as we know is very much responsible for the Al-Bashir Government’s attitude. It is a pity that Europe waits for the United States, as Mr Almunia suggested, albeit in a roundabout way, because the EU should take action independently on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us take a look at what is happening not just in Darfur but throughout Sudan and the Horn of Africa. The EU cannot be dependent on the worldview and disastrous policies of the US in respect of the Horn of Africa, as we have seen in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. The time has come for the EU to take action and I align myself with those MEPs who are calling on the Council and the President of the Commission to ensure that the EU does not wait any longer, and exerts the influence it actually has in Khartoum and in Africa to change the situation and to protect the people dying in Darfur. Otherwise, three years hence I along with other MEPs will be joining Mr Almunia or some other Commissioner in bemoaning the fact that the situation has become worse and worse.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We are proud that the very fact that, as Europeans, we are compelled to condemn manifest evil in whichever part of our world it may affect human beings. What is happening in Darfur is a manifest evil. Accordingly, we are bound to express our opposition to those who perpetrate such evils. Is it enough for us to simply express views that stem from a moral imperative and then rest in the knowledge of a job well done? Obviously not. We cannot rest as long as people continue to suffer. We can only rest when we have put a stop to the evil. Therefore, we are not entitled to rest simply because we have right on our side, but only when effective action has been taken.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We shall only be able to rest and be content when our words and actions have put a stop to the activities of those who kill, supply weapons and ideology, as well as those who permit, incite and inflict cruelty. We will only be able to walk with our heads held high when our vision of a moral order becomes reality. A person who did not commit a sin simply because he or she was not tempted to do so cannot be accused of sinning. By the same token, one cannot praise a person who could have taken action to stem evil, but who was content to simply point it out. We do not lack information about Darfur. We do not lack experience or an ethical and political assessment of events. What we are lack is effectiveness and, therefore, that is what we should focus on.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ever since the hostilities were launched in February 2003, Darfur, one of the poorest regions in Sudan, has been the scene of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

I have been critical of China’s reluctance to support UN action, it was claimed because of its oil interests in southern Sudan.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mr Gahler on behalf of the Committee on Development on budget aid for developing countries [2006/2079(INI) ] (A6-0005/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-403" speaker_id="2341" name="Michael GAHLER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="22-04-1960" birth_place="Frankfurt/Main" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, developing countries, too, are experiencing structural change or dislocation in the age of globalisation: politically, socially and in terms of the impact of climate change. These are often countries that have either not had any involvement or had insufficient involvement with sustainable development up to now. We note that previous approaches to help give people in these countries better prospects in life have had either no success or insufficient success. Budget support – the subject of this own-initiative report – is one of the recognised instruments of EU development cooperation today. It already accounts for over 20% of European Development Fund resources – and there is an upward trend.</p>
      <p sl="de">With the right framework, budget support can be an effective instrument of development cooperation. It involves donors and recipients opting for a partnership-based approach to development cooperation. Both parties must truly want this partnership, however, as the donor provides funds for the sole use of the recipient with no preconditions. A requirement is that agreement be reached on the recipient’s development strategies and programmes to be supported: in particular, comprehensive poverty-reduction strategies. Donor and recipient agree that the success of this support will be reviewed on the basis of many performance indicators.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Commission has found an approach that has received a great deal of attention and also met with much approval. This approach divides the promised payments up into fixed and variable tranches, with payment of the variable tranches being dependent on the achievement of objectives by the recipient. I envisage this instrument having great value and benefit in principle in instituting general policy dialogue between donor and recipient. The actors who are ultimately negotiating the budget support with the recipient have access to and input in the policies and national budget of the recipient. Partners willing to enter into cooperation can thus develop and review all key policy fields and measures together.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in Parliament must ask ourselves at this juncture how this benefit will be reflected in our work, for example with regard to the discussion of Commission strategy papers. Will the knowledge we gain or our input into development cooperation also change as a result? Will we be better able to account for the use of our development assistance and have better results to show for it, both now and in the future? Have we developed sufficient expertise to use this instrument?</p>
      <p sl="de">Last May’s evaluation by the OECD/DAC Evaluation Network on the basis of seven countries advises caution with regard to the assessment of budget support, stating that it is still too soon to carry out any real evaluation of this young instrument. We must also recognise when budget support is inappropriate or should be withdrawn. Donors should resist the temptation to be attracted to budget support because of its potential use in accelerating the disbursement of funds, or so that they can boast at international level about being an effective donor who also upholds the principle of recipient ownership. This must never be reduced to a matter of the disbursement of funds, or of merely paying lip service to the proper use of funds. In terms of effectiveness, too, budget support must always be examined from the point of view of whether it is really a better way of achieving the desired objectives than other instruments.</p>
      <p sl="de">The instrument of budget support cannot be used if, on the part of the recipient, ‘public expenditure management is [not] sufficiently transparent, accountable and effective’, if no ‘well-defined macroeconomic or sectoral policies established by the country itself and agreed to by its main donors are in place’, or if ‘public procurement is [not] open and transparent’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Article 61(2) of the Cotonou Agreement, from which I have just quoted, makes this clear. Only if these preconditions are met will direct budgetary assistance be granted as support or for sectoral reforms. Another interesting element is that budget support has to be tied to a process of reform. There is no budget support for the preservation of the status quo.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, a process of reform also entails the development of a culture of accountability in these countries and thus also the involvement of parliaments and the supreme audit institutions in the evaluation. This is an important point for us Members of the European Parliament, in particular, in terms of our cooperation with our counterparts in these countries. For this reason, I hope that, thanks to this report and this evaluation, we reach a stage where we can strengthen dialogue in the particular countries where we consider the Commission has been a little incautious, with a view to clarifying whether, at the end of the day, budget support is really the best instrument for those concerned.</p>

    <intervention id="3-404" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mr Gahler and his colleagues for this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission is convinced that, in order to consolidate the governments’ capacity to plan and implement macroeconomic reforms, sectoral reforms and reforms of their public finances, and also to stimulate growth and alleviate poverty, budget aid can be more effective than other kinds of aid, provided that certain eligibility conditions are met. I would like to stress that last caveat; provided that certain eligibility conditions are met.</p>
      <p sl="es">Budget aid provides funding with regard to the capital costs and the spending necessary in order to achieve the millennium development objectives, such as the construction of schools, hospitals or roads, paying teachers, nurses and maintaining infrastructures, etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, by supporting a country's budget, rather than a specific project, not only are the transaction costs reduced, but also, at the same time, local authorities are given more responsibility for the use of the funds, provided that there is a mechanism for controlling the use of those funds in the beneficiary countries. That is one of the eligibility conditions that I mentioned just now.</p>
      <p sl="es">Experience over recent years demonstrates that budgetary support can – and in fact often does – meet these expectations. This is confirmed by the highly positive assessment made last year by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee of the support for the general budget in seven countries analysed by that committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are therefore pleased with the comments in Mr Gahler's report on budgetary aid as a fundamental instrument of the European Union’s development cooperation. This is something that was also expressed in the European consensus on development, approved last year. This consensus, this joint declaration by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, commits us to increasing budget aid, provided that conditions allow it. We are working intensively with the Member States and other bodies in order to ensure that this commitment is fulfilled, in full compliance with the established legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would, however, like to respond to an issue raised in Mr Gahler's report, but which we believe is not entirely in line with reality. According to our analysis, budget aid is not synonymous with a lack of prudence or with bad management, but rather the opposite. The Commission applies strict eligibility criteria when deciding which countries should receive budget aid. Those criteria are reassessed before each payment, within the framework of the general aid programme. The objective is to minimise the risk of budget aid being squandered and trying to prevent it from being used inappropriately.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, improving the management of public finances is a key objective of our budget aid. Our approach is to assess the direction and credibility of the reforms of public finance management that our aid may support, and not so much to demand that any specific minimum standards are adhered to. This approach is shared by other budget aid bodies and was not questioned in the 2005 Special Report of the Court of Auditors, whose main recommendations have been taken into account by the Commission in drawing up a revised series of guidelines for budget aid.</p>
      <p sl="es">We entirely agree with the report’s demand that institutions playing a crucial role in controlling the executive be consolidated, but we believe that these institutions must be national, conforming to the local political framework, and not foreign bodies that must answer to donors. Generally speaking, the Commission believes that good governance, which is crucial to development, cannot be imposed from the outside. The establishment of innovative associations, drawn up in accordance with the initiative on governance and with the Commission’s Communication on this issue, is a promising way to promote good governance.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, even though the positive conclusions of recent independent assessments of budget aid are encouraging, we agree on the need continually to assess the effectiveness of budget aid and guarantee that the results are communicated clearly, in order to obtain the citizens’ support for development cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gahler on a pithy and instructive report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my view, even European Union citizens in difficult circumstances wish to help those who are less fortunate still, but only on the condition that the money reaches people in genuine need. We should ensure that our aid does not give rise to rumour and innuendo. Following the tsunami, for example, it has been alleged that, instead of rebuilding damaged dwellings, canny entrepreneurs are evicting the population from the coastal strip on the pretext of safety measures and then using our funds to build commercial hotels for tourists. Let us hope that nothing of the kind has happened.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What should be supported? I would highlight two aims. Firstly, we should support education, including the creation of a civil society. That involves ongoing long-term investment, which is essential, although its results are not immediately obvious. No innovation or development is possible without it. Secondly, we should support local people’s economic initiatives, that is to say, small and medium-sized enterprises. This should be done through technical, commercial, legal and organisational aid. Potential beneficiaries should be informed by the local authorities of how much European Union aid has been made available and for what purposes. This information cannot be kept secret and revealed only to governments and banks. We need to carefully monitor this aid. All of us, especially the Commission, are responsible for both the appropriate use of funds and for the money wasted or seized by fraudsters, dictators, wealthy international corporations, sly intermediaries and sometimes even by certain European Union entities and representatives. It is incumbent on us to devise wise policies and take great care of the money contributed by wealthy donors. We must take even more care, however, of the far more precious ‘widow’s mite’ contributed by our poorer taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot afford mistakes over the use of financial aid.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, budget aid has long had a very bad reputation, and it is the failure of the ultraliberal formulas that encompass the structural adjustment plans that has resulted in budget aid now becoming an integral part of the Union’s cooperation policy and in its being enshrined, as you were saying just now, in a European consensus. Budget aid is now regarded as a vital tool in the fight against poverty and in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, because it enables the most vulnerable populations to be reached directly and resources to be focused on the crucial sectors of education and basic health care.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, it also plays a decisive part in rehabilitating States. That is very important, because it is the decline of States and their inability to fulfil their basic public service obligations that is now hindering development, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Budget aid provides an incentive for appropriation, that is, the opportunity for the recipient country to choose its own development process, and it is also a precious instrument of political dialogue between donors and beneficiaries and perhaps even of support for parliaments in their role as public finance controller.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, budget aid cannot fulfil its objectives if prior conditions are not met, in particular good governance and the fight against corruption, democracy, respect for fundamental rights and a system for managing public finances that is controlled by a democratically-elected parliament. All of that has been outlined very effectively in the report by my fellow Member, Mr Gahler. However, as the Court of Auditors report revealed, at a time when budget aid really needs clarity, transparency and democracy, it is sometimes a lack of clarity that prevails, because, in several countries – Kenya and Malawi were mentioned – the Commission has used budget aid without the conditions, the proper prior conditions, having been met.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that we are now awaiting some very precise answers from the Commission and that we expect it to get right to the bottom of these countries that have been mentioned and to establish control. Like the report, I would recommend a form of external control, instead, either by having the Court of Auditors step in, or by creating a control body in cooperation with the other donors. I believe that, in return for precise monitoring, Parliament will support this new instrument that you have implemented.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am in favour of budget support, but I want to draw attention to two significant potential weaknesses and ask the Commission what steps are being taken to address them.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first weakness is that aid given through budget support will not reach the remotest and poorest areas if the national infrastructure in those areas is weak. Last October I visited West Pokot, a remote and arid area of north-west Kenya, and heard from local people about the problems they experienced persuading personnel to come and work there. Budget support for health and education in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals may simply not penetrate into remote areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission’s evaluation of the ninth EDF in Zambia makes exactly the same point: ‘Budget support does not give the tools to target specific geographical areas. In the absence of goals and corresponding indicators related to the spread of impact over the country, budget support is not relevant for targeting remote and poorer areas’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second weakness of budget support that I would highlight is that it is a blunt tool. It is very difficult to use it to deliver a balanced result between potentially conflicting development goals. For example, in the Cambodia country strategy paper for the tenth EDF, the main focal sector is support to the National Strategic Development Plan, which covers actions such as reviving the agricultural sector by promoting large-scale irrigation. But the country environmental profile warns this may lead to overuse of land and pollution from increased use of pesticides and fertilisers. I would like to ask the Commission what conditions on sustainability are laid down when budget support is offered, and how does the Commission check that these are being adhered to?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as I take the floor in the debate on Mr Gahler’s report on budget aid for developing countries, I should like to draw attention to the fact that, above all else, the award of this aid demonstrates the European Union’s implementation of the principle of solidarity in its relations with third countries. It appears, however, that allowing free access to the European Union market for goods from those countries would be a far more effective way of supporting them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the various restrictions on access to the European Union market and to the markets of other developed countries the world over, notably the United States, mean that the Union’s budget aid is a very important instrument for supporting developing countries. Given this situation, in which highly developed countries defend their markets from access by products from developing countries, it is very important to ensure that financial aid to these countries is provided on the basis of clear and transparent principles.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, budget aid must only be provided to third countries when it is clear that it will generate a positive outcome. Secondly, such aid should be directed primarily at reducing poverty, which is casting shame on the 21st century. Thirdly, European aid must be subject to parliamentary control, both on the part of the donor and on that of the recipient of the aid. Fourthly, budget aid from the European Union must be used first and foremost to support macro-economic reforms in the recipient country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fifthly, it is important to ensure that a substantial amount of the aid is used to foster primary and secondary education in the recipient countries, as well as healthcare. These are the two most important areas requiring long-term support. Sixthly, it should be borne in mind that significant financial aid could trigger the emergence of corrupt activities. It is therefore essential for the decision-making processes concerning budget aid to be clear and transparent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In conclusion, I would like to express my hope that the substantial financial resources made available to third countries by the European Union will serve not only to assist the development of those countries, but also to ensure that the European Union is recognised as a major force in international relations in our globalised world.</p>

      <p sl="en">от името на групата ITS . – Уважаеми г-н комисар, уважаеми г-н докладчик, уважаеми дами и господа депутати, първо бих искал да поздравя докладчика за чудесния балансиран доклад, който той е направил, но трябва да кажа, че след разширяването на Европейският съюз нещата от гледна точка на субсидиите, отпускани извън границите на Европейския съюз, стоят по малко различен начин.</p>
      <p sl="en">Какво точно имам предвид: осем от деветте региона на Румъния и пет от шестте региона на България съставляват тринадесет от петнайсетте най-бедни региона в Европейския съюз като цяло. В доклада четем, че трябва да се насочат повече средства за борба с бедността, но какво да кажа аз, който идвам от страна, в която пенсионерите живеят с по-малко от 50 евро на месец, а пенсионерите са два милиона души. Какво да кажем, от гледна точка на развитието на образованието и на медицинското обслужване, когато се вижда, че в страни като България медицинските работници и учителите получават месечни заплати в размер 150-200 евро, при това става въпрос за високите заплати в тези сектори.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ето защо трябва много внимателно да се подхожда, когато става дума за осигуряване на субсидии извън Европейския съюз. Нека престанем да се опитваме да вадим треската от чуждото око, а да не забелязваме гредата в собственото. Искам да се присъединя към призивите на колегите, които чух до сега, за разработването на много специфичен механизъм, който да осигурява пълен контрол от страна на Комисията и на институциите на Съюза върху средствата, отпускани при предоставянето на помощи извън Европейския съюз за развитие.</p>
      <p sl="en">Защото много често, когато тези средства отиват в страни, които са политически нестабилни с произтичащите от това икономически и социални проблеми, се създава впечатлението, че Съюзът подкупва управляващите в тези страни, за да си осигури тяхната послушност или защитата от тяхна страна на правата на човека, което не е правилно. И твърде често тези средства не отиват за борба с бедността на обикновените хора, а за борба с бедността именно на върхушката, която властва в тези страни.</p>
      <p sl="en">Моля, и призовавам Комисията и всички колеги, нека да изработим механизъм, който да е ясен и твърд, така че тези средства да достигат действително до хората, които имат нужда от тях. И не забравяйте, че в момента Съюзът не може, все пак, да отделя толкова много средства за трети страни, защото в самия Съюз има много региони, които са дори по-бедни от държавите, за които са предназначени въпросните средства.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am pleased that our committee has taken the initiative to speak about the effectiveness of budget aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report – which is fairly critical – contains many reservations. I share each of those reservations, and I should like to illustrate them a little more. In the strategic documents by country that we are currently monitoring, we see that the budget aid provided by the Commission is often like a black box – it is impossible to evaluate. For example, in the case of Cambodia and Laos, the Commission is proposing to allocate 40% to 60% of the entire budget to the national anti-poverty programme, without giving the slightest indication of which sectors will actually be funded.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even more worrying is the fact that, when the Commission reveals to us the sectors that it once funded in its programmes, we see that they were not directly contributing to the fight against poverty. Under the guise of funding for national development programmes, the Commission is actually funding measures designed to improve the business, investment and trade climate. Consequently, it is not enough to make budget aid more sectoral and conditional in nature; the Commission must genuinely aim to fulfil the objectives of reducing poverty and of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, if such excesses are to be avoided – and I propose this whenever I can because this is my firm belief – a significant percentage of budget aid must be decentralised, for the benefit of NGOs and local authorities. This would mean preventing central governments from managing and monopolising all of the European budget aid. Decentralising aid would enable us to give the populations access to European funding and thus to make sure that our financial support is really benefiting the populations on the ground.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, we are currently discussing a draft European Parliament resolution concerning budget aid for developing countries. These are poor and backward countries where, in many cases, armed conflict or even full-scale war is taking place. Corruption is rife in these countries, and it would be a sick joke to speak of the rule of law, parliamentary democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights or political pluralism in this context. The only asset all these countries have in abundance is poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We want to help them. Wealthy Europe has never been extravagant. It has always thought long and hard before parting with money. The resolution before us reflects this attitude. If the 20 principles and 29 recommendations were applied to the letter it would be impossible to spend a single cent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We expect countries hoping to obtain aid to meet certain conditions. We all know what these conditions are, but I shall venture to recall some of them. Firstly, the initial condition for the award of budget aid is a properly functioning democracy. Secondly, for budget aid to be effective, the recipients and national structures must be efficient. They must be efficient not only in terms of a properly functioning democracy that respects fundamental freedoms, human rights and political pluralism, but also in terms of budget procedures, competent spending and the provision of services that will be the subject of control. In addition to this, aid may only be awarded in cases when the net benefit obtained thanks to that mechanism can be identified on the basis of clearly itemised criteria, and only following a detailed risk assessment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As we establish these principles, we should recall what the President of the Palestinian Authority stated in this House a few months ago. He was writing on the subject of the worrying decision concerning the award of budget aid to Malawi and Kenya, for which all the Member States have suspended budget aid. This move then cast doubt on the European Commission’s ability to use such an instrument effectively. Let us remember that an annual amount of EUR 6 is allocated to each child at school in Nairobi. That child will receive one pencil a year, and will have to share a textbook with two other children. There are between 100 and 120 children in each class. Most of the people are also short of water, electricity and food, yet this is one of the most stable countries in Africa. The World Bank continues to provide it with aid, and the European Investment Bank has also recently begun to do so.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this context, the statement that the European Parliament is concerned about the difficulties relating to assessing the degree to which effectiveness indicators have been met sounds rather strange. In particular, concern has been expressed concerning difficulties in assessing the impact on poverty. Parliament has urged the Commission to support efforts to foster developments in the compilation of statistics, data collection, quality assessment and analysis. I am firmly convinced that the principles presented here are appropriate for Germany, France and England, but certainly not for the countries we are concerned with. Therefore, I cannot understand the reason for this resolution and what it is meant to improve.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, since the 1990s, there has been a pronounced trend in international development cooperation towards direct budget support. The popularity of this instrument rose against the background of the ongoing discussions on improving the effectiveness of aid and on meeting the Millennium Development Goals. This goal should be just as important to the EU as carrying out sound structural operations at home.</p>
      <p sl="de">Budget support is considered an appropriate measure for the achievement of macroeconomic objectives or for large-scale infrastructure programmes. If there is a lack of decentralisation in a country, however, it is questionable whether marginalised regions and sections of the population will be able to derive any particular benefit from budget support. Project aid will have to remain an important part of this cooperation, therefore, to enable the swift achievement of measurable results at local level. The main focus of Community development cooperation must continue to be justice and poverty reduction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Corruption and poor financial management are among the most alarming issues in connection with budget support. Direct budget support must promote the strengthening of civil society, and a culture of accountability for the funds received must be created. In this regard, it is important that the parliaments of the beneficiary countries participate in adopting the budget and that the budget laws be published. The criteria to be met to entitle a country to receive direct budget support are laid down in Article 61 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. These criteria must form the foundations, and there must be regular checks to ensure that they are being met.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Gahler for the report on budget aid to developing countries. In recent years, budget aid has become one of the main forms of development aid provided by the European Union. As far as the European Commission is concerned, this type of aid is a key instrument of Community development policy. It is indeed the case that in favourable circumstances, budget aid can prove a powerful tool, helping to achieve the European Union’s aims in the area of development aid, sustainable economic and social development, the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy, the fight against poverty, economic growth, job creation, and the development and strengthening of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the European Parliament’s report, we emphasise that as an instrument for aid, budget support can only be effective if both partners take on full responsibility with a genuine spirit of partnership. The European Parliament calls for budget aid to focus as much as possible on development priorities relating to combating poverty. It also emphasises the need to ensure that these priorities figure prominently in the donor-recipient policy dialogue, and to guarantee parliamentary control by both the donor and the recipient. We believe that democratic governments, the rule of law and decentralisation offer the best guarantee of a proper use of development funds.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 requires a strong commitment from the international community to reduce poverty. The effectiveness of its aid measures is a prerequisite for sustainable aid that meets the needs of developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when the principle of aid effectiveness is a priority for the European Union, budget aid shows how relevant it is, fulfilling, as it does, the appropriation principle and the need for better coordination between sponsors. While this instrument therefore appears to meet the demands for effective aid, it must be used under certain conditions. Finally, budget aid enables beneficiary governments to take on a more assertive role in the coordination of development aid: this active approach creates a spirit of partnership, which is necessary in order to face up to the problems of appropriation and of the sustainability of aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Poverty reduction is a non-negotiable objective. Thus, the involvement of all parties is needed to accomplish it. Developing countries and the European Union must work to ensure that the promises of the Millennium Summit, in 2000, are kept. For its part, the European Union must be equal to the expectations it has raised.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the implementation of the EU action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing [2006/2225(INI) ] (A6-0015/2007).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, illegal fishing is a trend that is developing extensively today and seriously harming the activities of European fisheries, local fishing communities and fisheries in developing countries, not least in those with which the European Community has concluded fishing agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also an activity that, I am afraid to say, is extremely lucrative. I would cite the example of bluefin tuna, particularly in the Mediterranean, specimens of which are sold at absolutely astronomical prices. We therefore find ourselves in a vicious circle, which leads to the gradual, though accelerated, depletion of fishery resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Legal fisheries – those that comply with the regulations – are, for their part, very heavily penalised by these illegal activities, which can, in fact, be defined in fairly broad terms. We are talking about illegal, unregulated, undeclared fishing. That therefore relates to many activities: pirate fishing, the use of unauthorised fishing gear, the catching of unauthorised species, unlicensed fishing and the policy of transferring cargo at sea from one boat to another. The scope of the illegal activities is extremely broad.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What, then, is the purpose of this own-initiative report? In 2002, the FAO launched an international action plan against illegal fishing, which was subsequently replaced by a European Union action plan, which was adopted by the Council in 2002. The plan was unfortunately implemented in a variety of ways, at different levels, by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At this very moment, the European Commission is working on evaluating the Member States' action plans on the fight against illegal fishing ahead of the meeting of the FAO – the FAO's Committee on Fisheries – which will be held in the first week of March, in Rome, and which will be an opportunity to re-launch the international action plan against illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union has a huge responsibility in this area. Why? Firstly, because the European Union is ranked third in the world in terms of fishing activities, after China and Peru. It has one of the world’s largest fleets. Moreover, it largely resorts to using flags of convenience, which cause a huge number of problems, not only for fishing, but also for maritime transport. Finally, the EU is also one of the world’s largest markets in fish.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The responsibilities are therefore many. The Commission’s response to us is that this whole business is complex, many parties come into play, nothing can be done by working alone, it is expensive, one cannot ask some Member States to comply with a number of rules and not ask the others to do the same, and so on. The pretexts and excuses for the lacklustre results are legion and, sadly, there have not been enough initiatives to fight effectively against this activity of illegal fishing which, once again, has developed at an extremely serious rate over the last few years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The responsibilities are as much those of the port States, as they are called, as they are of the flag States or the States in which fishery products are marketed. There are in fact many levels: that of the regional fisheries organisations, that of the Member States, the European level; it is at all these levels that action must be taken, across the board, with the involvement of the Directorate-General for Fisheries and the Directorate-General for the Environment, the Directorate-General for Development and the Directorate-General for Trade. Hard work is therefore what is required here, but only action on the part of all these administrations and these political officials will prove truly effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are the key measures in my report, which, I might add, has been unanimously adopted within the Committee on Fisheries, showing that this is indeed a concern shared by all of our Member States? There is the traceability of fishery products and the introduction of blacklists, that is to say, of lists of boats that are not authorised to fish or that have already been punished for illegal fishing activities. We should condemn today the lack of coordination and cooperation between the various sources of information regarding these boats, which are authorised or unauthorised to fish.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Among the important measures, I should also mention those that consist in preventing illegal fishing products from being landed and marketed on the European market, and then, finally, the actions to be carried out in the field of European and international law. There are, in fact, legal vacuums today that prevent the crews of vessels carrying out illegal fishing activities from being challenged and punished.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, it is absolutely vital that we have a more integrated European policy, in terms both of control and monitoring and of penalties. It is from this global perspective that the report outlines a number of initiatives and proposes a number of measures that we are discussing here, with a view to the FAO meeting, in March, within the context of which it is crucial for us to appear far more proactive and far more dynamic.</p>

    <intervention id="3-419" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Aubert and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their involvement in this truly exhaustive report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">This initiative from Parliament comes at a time when the Commission is committed to a public consultation on the review and strengthening of the current European Community policy on tackling this kind of fishing. I am particularly pleased to note Parliament’s commitment on an issue which is of crucial importance to achieving the sustainable management of fisheries resources inside and outside of Community waters.</p>
      <p sl="es">First of all, I am pleased that the report stresses that the fight against illegal fishing must begin in our waters and also involve our vessels. Community waters are regulated, but that does not mean that illegal practices do not take place within them.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report also acknowledges another extremely important aspect, namely how to prevent fisheries products from third countries that have been caught illegally from entering the Community. As the main market and importer of fisheries products from all parts of the world, the Community has a special responsibility in terms of guaranteeing that products that end up on the tables of European consumers do not originate from illegal activities. This means that a new approach must be taken with a view to properly controlling the legality of fisheries products imported into Community territory.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another aspect that must be stressed is the need, indicated in the report, to create more synergies in order to improve the supervision, control and monitoring of fisheries activities. Illegal operators usually employ clandestine and international methods in order to disguise their activities. The success of investigation into these activities depends on cooperation amongst the different services involved in maritime monitoring at international level and also at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="es">I cannot comment on all of the points of the report here, but I would like to stress, for example, the call for greater consistency in the sanctions imposed by the Member States for serious violations of fisheries laws, and the need to resolve the main problems caused by public fishing flags. These points demonstrate that Parliament and the Commission are on the same wavelength in terms of priorities for future actions.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission has not been inactive over recent years. The European Community has made considerable progress since the adoption in 2002 of its action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. This progress can essentially be seen in the Community’s activities, at international level, aimed at promoting measures to combat illegal fishing in all of the bodies competent in the field of fisheries and maritime law. Nevertheless, the most significant progress in the fight against illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing has related to the regional fisheries organisations, the majority of which, thanks to the Community’s efforts, have now adopted a wide range of measures against illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Community has also improved the policy of assistance for coastal developing countries, which are the main victims of the kind of fishing we are debating today. Strengthening those countries’ capacity to adequately control the fisheries activities in their waters has been funded from the European Union’s budget, thanks to an association agreement in the field of fisheries, both at national level and at regional level, on the model of the recently agreed regional plan for fisheries surveillance in the South-West Indian Ocean.</p>
      <p sl="es">At Community level, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002 also promoted the policy to combat illegal fishing through the adoption of provisions in the field of controlling compliance with Community rules and the creation of the Fisheries Control Agency. However, despite the significant progress made in the fight against illegal fishing, it has still not been eradicated by any means, and it is still one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable management of fisheries resources and marine biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Almost five years after the adoption of the 2002 action plan, therefore, the Commission believes that the time has come to draw up a new strategy to tackle this kind of fishing. Within this context, the Commission has decided that this year illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing will be one of the main priorities of the common fisheries policy and of maritime policy. The Commission will draw up proposals in this regard and present them to the Member States and to this Parliament during the second half of this year.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report that we are debating today is a particularly timely contribution to the work on which the Commission will base its proposals.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, over recent years illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has been the subject of numerous debates and discussions and the time has now come for us to act at European level. The report by Mrs Aubert and the Committee on Fisheries represents an extremely significant and encouraging step in that direction.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Aubert for her report, which reminds us of the problem of piracy at sea and the poor record in terms of what has been done to combat it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to thank her for supporting the amendments that I believe have clarified her report, establishing the boundaries between unrecorded and unregulated illegal fishing and violations of the common agricultural policy in Community waters. This is an important aspect because, although we need to put an end to both, completely different weapons are required for each.</p>
      <p sl="es">One of the most important weapons is action by regional fisheries organisations, which are perhaps currently the only possible defence against illegal actions at sea in a battle which is, by definition, international and multilateral, and whose role has also been re-assessed as a result of the amendments presented. At a time of such concern about the sustainability of the marine environment and when our own fishermen are gradually being denied access to resources, it is extremely worrying that we are even having to witness certain Member States taking steps backwards, including one that I know well. And it is depressing that, last Tuesday, the Director for External Policies of the Directorate-General for Fisheries should have had to admit that the European Union had failed to slow down illegal fisheries. And all at a time like this.</p>
      <p sl="es">It was in Galicia last week that the fishing authorities of eighteen Member States began to debate the package of measures to combat illegal fishing, which will apparently not be presented to us before the middle of the year, according to the Commissioner. With regard to this issue, the ball is more than ever in the Council’s court, because, without genuine political will on the part of the Member States, without their firm commitment to harmonising actions, making them obligatory and making them a priority, things will carry on the same next year and the year after. I hope that that does not happen and that we will have an effective policy soon.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thank you very much, Mr President, and allow me to protest once again about the fact that a fisheries debate is taking place at night and that even a new report being newly included on the agenda is being put before it.

      <p sl="es">The FAO has calculated that up to 30% of fish landed comes from illegal fishing. The EU has signed up to the FAO’s international action plan and in 2003 the Commission tabled proposals to transpose this action plan into the European acquis.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Fisheries drew up this own-initiative report in preparation for the international forum on illegal fishing set to take place in Rome at the beginning of March, and in order that the Commission take account, in its new action plan, of Parliament’s opinion.</p>
      <p sl="es">Numerous amendments tabled by my group will be included and I believe that thanks to those amendments, we have achieved a better definition of illegal fishing. Furthermore, we have included issues such as increased monitoring and the need for greater cooperation at international level.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, although this is not so much a question of implementing tighter measures but rather of improving the implementation of existing measures, there is certainly a need for an effective control and inspection system within a common legal framework across the EU and if possible under the auspices of the Community Fisheries Control Agency based in Vigo.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our amendments call for entry to European ports to be barred to vessels involved in illegal fishing, for Member States not to register such vessels, for Member States to discourage their nationals from flying flags of convenience, and for importers, transporters and other sectors concerned not to tranship or deal with fish caught by those vessels.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also call for cooperation between the Member States to step up control of vessels. We are aware that it is difficult to differentiate between legal and illegal catches, in particular when what is landed is not fresh fish but frozen or processed and where there are commercial networks with third countries and the fish has been processed before it reaches the European market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Efforts are therefore required to identify the origin of fish, because millions of people around the world depend on fisheries resources and we must guarantee the availability of those resources for future generations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President. I want to begin by complimenting Marie-Hélène Aubert on the quality of her report. Her explanatory statement contains an excellent analysis of the problem and of the extent of progress made in relation to the EU Action Plan of 2002. It makes ten very clear recommendations for a new Action Plan to start in 2007. Five of these recommendations involve internal measures and five involve cooperation with other countries, both directly and through the medium of regional fisheries management organisations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Central to the issue of combating IUU fishing are improvements in traceability, both of vessels and of the fish that they catch or transport. This includes, amongst other things, insisting on the use of FAO identification standards for EU vessels and those entering EU ports, and on the development of proper catch documentation schemes. But it also means better exchange of information between the parties concerned, so that blacklists of both fishing and fish transport vessels can be disseminated and the possibility of converting to a white list through reflagging can be avoided. The establishment of blacklists is, however, only effective if there are serious consequences for the vessels concerned. That is why we urge the Commission to take very seriously the recommendation in paragraph 18 of the resolution that consideration be given to extending the import controls relating to health and hygiene to cover the products of IUU fishing as well. For this reason, the revival of the inter-services consultation group is particularly welcome.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, there are many other steps that could be taken, which is why we are asking for the fight against illegal fishing to be one of the priorities of the annual work programme of the Community Fisheries Control Agency. In this context too, we must be sure that our own house is fully in order, which is why we repeat Parliament’s previous requests for common minimum penalties for serious infringements to be made applicable across all the Member States. Equal treatment is a major factor in encouraging compliance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The importance of assisting developing countries to monitor fishing activities in their own waters must also be stressed. There is an additional responsibility in this regard where we have concluded fisheries partnership agreements with them. The inclusion of IUU fishing in the Commission’s work programme for this year is very welcome, but we need a clear timetable in this regard. It is good to hear that the Commission will be presenting something to Parliament in the second half of the year, but we hope that it will be sooner rather than later, and comprehensive in its coverage.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I too would like to thank Mrs Aubert and to commend her on her outstanding report, which I endorse.</p>
      <p sl="es">Not only does illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing endanger biodiversity and the environment, leading to costs that in many cases may be impossible to recoup completely, but it also represents – as previous speakers have mentioned – a significant cost for many societies that currently live from fishing and that hope future generations can do likewise.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, I feel that the EU has a twofold responsibility. First and foremost, it must set an example to the world and demonstrate by deed and in particular by willingness, that the fight against illegal fishing is one of its priorities. Secondly, it must take the lead on the world stage in the fight against illegal fishing, which involves using existing EU mechanisms – be it via fishing agreements or via cooperation with third countries – and always to include some clauses leading to the prioritisation of this issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time, however, given that one of the key problems in detecting and combating illegal fishing is – as previous speakers have also mentioned – the issues of traceability and of fisheries control is vital inasmuch as it is often impossible to know whether illegal fishing has taken place. Mechanisms must therefore be established to enhance traceability.</p>
      <p sl="es">To this end, I also wish to say that in December, this Chamber adopted a resolution on eco-labelling. Many of the proposals in this resolution would help the fight against illegal fishing by means of much-needed traceability mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="es">I too welcome the report’s call for the Commission to present its eco-labelling proposal by June.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I too would like to congratulate Mrs Aubert on her report. Large-scale illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significantly contributed to the difficulties with which the fisheries sector has to contend. Large-scale illegal fishing damages marine ecosystems, increases the cost of fishing, and reduces the incomes of people who fish legally and who comply with the rules on preserving fisheries resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Large-scale illegal fishing, as the report says, undermines the incomes of communities who depend on fishing in different countries, and those least equipped to monitor their exclusive economic zones are the hardest hit. Large-scale illegal fishing also contributes to the deterioration of on-board working conditions and hygiene, and undermines the labour rights of crews. Accordingly, we feel that illegal fishing, which generates significant illicit profits for large-scale fleets working for the large economic and financial groups involved in fishing and even for organised crime networks, should not be confused with infringements of the common fisheries policy by parts of the small-scale traditional fleet, often committed because of the economic crisis that they face.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is worrying that, despite the 2002 Food and Agriculture Organisation plan, which was rapidly transposed into the Community acquis and then implemented, large-scale illegal fishing continues to increase owing to loopholes or imprecision in the existing rules. The fight against large-scale illegal fishing is hampered by the use of flags of convenience, by the lack of monitoring at sea, by transhipping on the high seas, by the lack of control at ports and by the lack of cooperation and coordination between the relevant authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given that illegal fishing has its biggest impact on those parts of the fleet operating on the high seas and on the continental shelf, especially in the least developed countries, cooperation among the Member States and among international fishing organisations is vital if this kind of fishing is to be combated. To this end the necessary resources must be obtained, including financial resources for implementing the measures needed, such as the effective monitoring of fishing activities. The strengthening of deterrents should be accompanied by enhanced traceability of fisheries products, as has been highlighted by previous speakers, with eco-labelling also worth mentioning in this regard. Equally important, as the report states, is to intensify port state control of landings and transhipments from third country vessels. We believe that the existing measures already cover the main issues and that what they lack is more rigorous and fairer implementation and greater international-level coordination. This is not, therefore, simply a matter of creating more measures and more restrictive measures for the fisheries sector, especially if their impact or their unilateral nature has the perverse effect of benefiting the vessels operating illegally to an even greater extent.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Third country vessels operating in the exclusive economic zones of the Member States must be subject to the rules of the common fisheries policy and to existing national requirements. Naturally, it is always possible to improve the rules in force and to plug any gaps. In this regard, we feel that this report, which in spite of one or two reservations we generally support, makes a valuable contribution to the issue. We feel, however, that it is, at the very least, premature to include combating illegal fishing in the framework of a future maritime policy for the Union, which we have only just begun to debate as part of the Green Paper put forward by the Commission. We accept the idea of greater international and EU-level cooperation and coordination, but we must avoid situations that may lead to centralisation and must safeguard the Member States’ exclusive monitoring powers, as it is the Member States that best know each of their exclusive economic zones.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to protect all operators who carry out their activities within the context of sound fisheries management based on best practice and safeguarding the marine environment. It is vitally important to clamp down on illegal fishing through surveillance and control measures, accompanied by sanctions for serious violations of Community legislation. To combat illegal fishing, however, we cannot confine ourselves to repressive actions, but we must also promote strong preventive action through structural measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">To this end, the report on which we are going to vote – for which I thank Mrs Aubert – very effectively identifies a number of strategic actions, from the promotion of commercial regulation measures that will make it possible to identify the origin of fish caught, to the proposal on eco-labelling, which would keep illegally caught fish off the European market, and to the study on tariffs and rules of origin. These measures are essential to reduce, if not eliminate, illegal fishing by Community fishing boats in Community waters and to prevent the landing and marketing of fish caught illegally outside EU waters.</p>
      <p sl="it">Equally significant is the call for a study on compliance with Community labour and health and safety legislation, on respect for the social rights of workers and on their living and working conditions on board. Improving full traceability of fish all along the chain of custody, from net to plate, preventing the depletion of fish stocks and degradation of the environment, and enhancing the quality of life and work for the communities that depend on fishing for their livelihoods are forms of prevention and dissuasion that will make it possible to curb illegal fishing by structural means and make the Community fisheries sector the best in the world.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Morillon, of course we must all congratulate our rapporteur on her outstanding report. We must also begin by noting that the situation as it stands is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is unacceptable that the amount of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing of bluefin tuna, which is the species that has been the subject of most analysis in this connection, is 50% greater than the amount fished legally. This has led to the total depletion of stocks, to the collapse of the value at which fish is sold and in turn to the ruin of the fishermen. This is a situation that the Community cannot continue to tolerate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Of all the measures put forward here as a means of addressing the problem, I should like to highlight traceability as a vital prerequisite to success. This is the measure that we must ensure is adopted in the very short term and if it is tightly enforced I am sure that we will see a very different situation soon.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report, which continues the efforts of this Parliament to address the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union’s 2002 Action Plan to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing includes four actions to be implemented at Community level. One of these is to define the responsibility of Member States to prevent their nationals from engaging in IUU fishing. Indeed, the related Council Regulation of 2002 requires Member States to take action against nationals that infringe the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We seem to be very efficient in tracking and taking action against our own fishermen for any transgression of European law, while we seem at the same time to have been rather less efficient at dealing with the much bigger problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The problem of overfishing and illegal fishing is international. It goes beyond the European Union waters, and yet the fishermen that I represent can with some justice complain that the Commission sometimes cannot see beyond our own waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is clearly a lot still to be achieved to deal with this problem and I welcome the practical proposals such as the suggestion that vessels bringing fish into the European Union should be subject to the same documentation delivery requirement as vessels operating within the European Union. Likewise I welcome the suggestion that the Commission should engage with developing countries to give them assistance in dealing with IUU fishing. I understand that one of the vehicles for achieving this is through the various bilateral fisheries agreements with developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would like to be sure that this represents a joined-up approach to the problem and that it is not merely ad hoc. I note that some countries have not been cooperative. Surely if we are making bilateral fisheries agreements with a country, we can force a higher degree of cooperation from them. Otherwise cynics might suggest that we are more interested in getting the fish than stopping illegal fishing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, many of our debates regarding fisheries have been centred around sustainability and the importance of finding the right equilibrium between the protection of the marine environment, the protection of fish stock and the viability of the activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regulations have been set up and fishermen are obliged to abide by these regulations so that an optimum standard is achieved, a standard that would be beneficial to everyone. These regulations have been based on specific statistics gathered from our seas and standards have been set on this information. However, I feel that, unless we tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing with an iron fist, we would be doing a disservice to honest fishermen and restricting their activity to the benefit of others acting illegally.</p>
      <p sl="en">The line between legal and illicit fishing is sometimes very fine and we need to have a clear-cut definition in this regard in order to avoid misunderstanding. We need an effective control system and a management programme that will be more coherent and specific so as to apply the existing regulations with more accuracy. We must also try to negotiate with our neighbouring states in order to adopt the same policies so that we would have a one-sea, one-policy system, which undoubtedly would be beneficial to all. In order to do this, we must be willing to share our technology with these countries and encourage new partnership agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Further to this, cooperation between us, the Member States, has to be strengthened. Proof of the legal origin of fish catches should be compulsory before any content is offloaded in the EU. This should include documents that show that fish have been caught in accordance with RFMO rules. This will be a very important stepping stone in ensuring that our fishermen get the right dues, and that, furthermore, our seas are protected from overfishing. When stocks were plentiful, we would often turn a blind eye to unregulated activity. Now, I think, is the time to act before it is too late. No regulation and no law will ever be effective or have any meaning if overfishing renders our seas barren.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am responsible for the subject of cod fishing in the Baltic Sea. In my work on this matter, I have been able to observe that, despite reduced fishing quotas, parts of the cod stock are close to the biologically critical limit. The threats to cod are many, but, despite everything, the greatest threat is illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As a basis for my report, I tried to get hold of the Commission’s assessment of the extent of illegal fishing around the Baltic. The information was kept secret, however, and it took me months to extract it. Yesterday, I got hold of the report, however, and I now suddenly understand what all the secretiveness was about. Illegal fishing in the Baltic is worse than we had all imagined. I can only regret that Sweden is among the worst culprits. The Commission states, however, that Poland is the worst culprit of all. When the inspectors checked up on fishing in Poland, the actual figures were 48% larger than the catches reported. This means, then, that something approaching a third of Polish fishing proves to be illegal. The second worst culprit was Sweden. In Sweden, the actual figures found when the checks were carried out were as much as 21% larger than the catches reported. That is quite incomprehensible, because Swedish fishermen do not even fulfil their quotas.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The conclusion that I draw from the report I read is that we must find a new strategy. We cannot pin our hopes on endless negotiations about reductions in fishing quotas. The environmental movement should get around to withdrawing its demands for an end to fishing. All those of us who would safeguard fishing in seas such as the Baltic should instead unite in the fight to stop illegal fishing. I should therefore like to demand four things from the Commission. Firstly, instead of protecting the culprits and keeping their identities secret, you should expose them by publishing the names of those countries that do not put an end to illegal fishing. Secondly, you should ensure that electronic logbooks are required without delay for all fishing boats in the Baltic, irrespective of their size. Thirdly, you should take Poland to court for breaching the fishing regulations; and fourthly you should immediately set up an inquiry into the possibility of introducing individual transferable fishing quotas that give individual professional fishermen an interest of their own in protecting fish stocks. I would therefore ask today, in this House, if the Commission is prepared to do these things.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Aubert, on her report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The question we are debating here today is of particular interest if account is taken of the repercussions which it has both on the marine environment and on legal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="el">Illegal fishing is one of the most fundamental reasons for the collapse of many fish stocks. In reality it undermines all our efforts to exploit fishery resources rationally and to protect the marine environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">Apart from the environmental impact, it also has adverse economic repercussions because it distorts competition between fishermen and affects the viability of those acting in accordance with the legislation enacted.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I shall also examine this issue from the point of view of the human factor: often illegal fishing has repercussions on the safety of crews, given that they only have minimal guarantees in respect of the terms of employment and safety of human life at sea. Illegal fishing means illegal and uncontrolled employment.</p>
      <p sl="el">As you know, this is not a new phenomenon. However, the increased demand for fisheries products, in conjunction with a reduction in available resources has caused a burgeoning of this phenomenon, especially by vessels sailing under flags of convenience.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report by Mrs Aubert covers the most important aspects of the problem which need to be examined, such as:</p>
      <p sl="el">firstly, the responsibilities of the state under whose flag the vessel is sailing;</p>
      <p sl="el">secondly, the responsibilities of the state in which the fish are landed;</p>
      <p sl="el">thirdly, the responsibilities of the productive classes involved in transporting and marketing fisheries products until they reach the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that more measures need to be taken to control and stamp out illegal fishing, both at European level and at the level of regional fisheries organisations. We must act. We must protect the environment, legal fishermen, consumers and the legal order. We need to be decisive and strict.</p>

      <p sl="es">Two weeks ago saw the start of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Equal opportunities and the right to live without discrimination are among the key values on which the EU is based.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission is well aware of the fact that the Roma are among the groups most at risk of discrimination and of being excluded from the labour market, from society, from involvement in drawing up policy and from cultural life.</p>
      <p sl="es">Consequently, the Commission has undertaken to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the issue of the exclusion of the Roma minority.</p>
      <p sl="es">I should like to mention two of these: firstly, the implementation of the 2000 Directive, which provides protection against discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds. The Commission wishes to ensure that this Directive be incorporated into the legislation and to be implemented properly in all Member States. Secondly, I wish to mention the use of financial instruments, specifically the Structural Funds and, most importantly, the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission has asked the Member States to incorporate the objective of including the Roma community when it draws up its operational plans for the financial perspective 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="es">Major effort is required to increase awareness among the Roma and among the population as a whole of the right to live without discrimination and to enjoy the benefits of diversity. In this regard, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and the ongoing information campaign entitled ‘For Diversity, Against Discrimination’ are, in our view, extremely useful instruments.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission welcomes the achievements made so far during the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 in which nine governments from Central and Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans, including five EU Member States, are currently taking part. For the first time, the national governments of these countries made a commitment to learn from each other and to exchange strategies on how to improve life for the Roma minority in areas such as employment, education, housing and healthcare.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission welcomes the fact that all of this is taking place in close cooperation with the Roma community. We also need policies geared toward the future. The high level group for the social and labour market integration of ethnic minorities set up by the Commission is paying special attention to issues relating to the Roma community. The group will publish its recommendations at the end of the year, which we are sure will provide extremely valuable information for future European policy on the inclusion of ethnic minorities, including the Roma.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, Madam President, I should like to point out that the Commissioners’ Group on Fundamental Rights will deal with all of these issues in their meeting scheduled for July this year.</p>

      <p sl="hu">We know that following enlargement in 2004, many Roma tried to come to Europe – Western Europe. We also know that the actual figures were not very high, but they did call attention to the terrible and hopeless situation in which the Roma find themselves. We knew that the Roma were not desirable guests in Europe. Unsure already how to deal with Roma migration, most host countries responded by tightening their procedures for requesting asylum, which compelled many Roma to return to their home countries. Since they had sold all their possessions, they returned to much worse circumstances than those they had left behind.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We also know that because of the exaggerated, hysterical and untrue statements of the media, the situation gave rise to fundamental fears in Western European countries. The situation even spurred many countries to try to prevent further enlargement. We now also know that this atypical tendency to migration among European Roma is in fact caused by the segregation in schools, the enormous unemployment rate, very strong prejudice, and limited access to health care services which they suffer in their home countries. We also know that the Roma would like to live and thrive in their home countries.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In spite of the enormous sums of PHARE money, the ghettoisation, segregation, exclusion and anti-Roma feeling has continued to grow since enlargement, and in Western Europe as well. The European Union has a great responsibility and interest in promoting the integration of the Roma. Beyond ensuring the financial framework, the task of the European Commission must include promotion and monitoring as well. Every instrument for influencing Member States must be used, and a European strategy needs to be developed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We would like to see a Green Paper, and sanctions against countries that do not follow the Directives aimed at ending segregation, and those concerning employment, equal opportunities, and the equality of opportunity. This should be done so that Europe and the home countries may make the most of Roma prosperity, especially in light of the foreseeable European demographic indicators, at a time when we are talking about a greying Europe. The Roma are basically seeking to thrive in these countries, and do not wish to leave their countries behind.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, such is the way this place is organised, somehow I have more speaking time than Mrs Járóka, which is hardly appropriate. I agree with everything she has said and the reason for that is that the speakers here present feel united in asking the Commission exactly what free movement of the Roma within the EU borders actually means. Our understanding is that such now is the level of discrimination – not only actual discrimination against the homogenous Roma population but also infringements on their ability to move, i.e. infringements on the ability of long-term-resident Roma in particular countries to move freely in reality. This can be because of actual restrictions, for example through visas and actual practical restrictions, and it can also mean, as Mrs Járóka was implying, restrictions through discrimination: when Roma move traditionally through countries and from one country to another they face discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I would like to hear from the Commission in its statement is exactly what is its understanding of these infringements and restrictions. What study has it undertaken of what these infringements are and what does it think it can do to ease these restrictions for the Roma community?</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, what is the Commission saying about the Year of Equal Opportunities 2007? I have heard very little about the issue of the Roma within this context. I have heard plenty on the issue of ageing, disability, race and religion. But specifically on the issue of the Roma, what is the programme of the Commission? I know it is slightly unfair to ask you that, Mr Almunia. It is not your area of expertise, so please do not think that I am getting at you. However, please tell the Commissioners that we have not heard specifics. Please take that message back. What are you going to do this year?</p>
      <p sl="en">What is the High Level Experts Group doing in terms of free movement? What is in its pending tray on the Roma issue, i.e. actual discrimination issues, harassment issues? How is money being spent? Is it going to relieve poverty? Is it going to educational programmes? Those are all things that Mrs Járóka, Mrs Mohácsi and others have been struggling and fighting for for some time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The PSE Group fully supports their approach in asking the Commission for answers, and I think this evening is a good time to get those answers. If you cannot give them, Mr Almunia, please transmit this urgent message to your Commissioner colleagues, because it is about time we got some specific answers to these questions.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First of all, I would like to clarify the following: the background to my remarks is not the desire to question the right to free movement by Europeans, and hence of the Roma, nor do we or I wish to request any extra rights for these people, for this minority group. My original aim was that the European Union should examine how it might document – something that my fellow Member Mr Moraes has also mentioned – the number of forced migrants, those people who are forced to leave their homes because they are subject to ongoing discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Commissioner mentioned that it is not enough for a country to take action against discrimination, but the EU Member State in question must also ensure that there is integration. I think we have not yet reached this stage, nor even the stage where we might be able to monitor discrimination in each and every Member State, or to take appropriate steps against it.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In April 2005, Parliament adopted a resolution of which the first sentence states that there is discrimination against the Roma within the Member States of the European Union. We do not know how many leave their homes because they are subject to ongoing discrimination and hope that their lives may be less troubled in a Western European country.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Next week, we will have the second opportunity, when the Hungarian court will hear the case involving children who have been placed in special schools without any justification. Although they are of sound mind, they are compelled to attend educational institutions established for those with developmental handicaps. I have personally taken on the cases of 12 such children because Hungarian special schools are generally full of Roma children, who make up at least 70% of the special student population in Hungary, and unfortunately there are not very many Member States where these figures show any striking difference.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A few months ago, several hundred Hungarian Roma sought asylum from the Swedish state, which naturally – as far as I know – rejected their request. I do not know how many of those families have children who suffer discrimination in a similar situation. This much is certain, if something like this were to happen to my children, I would seek asylum in another country.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The struggle to eliminate discrimination and to guarantee human rights within the frontiers of our Member States is our common responsibility. We have the ability to take steps against discrimination, and we must do so. Since 2000 we have spent EUR 750 million within the territory of the EU on the integration of the Roma, yet the proportion who are unemployed and the proportion of children declared to be developmentally handicapped have increased. The time has come now for the European Commission, taking seriously the work it has done to date, to develop a strategy which – as my colleague Mrs Járóka has also mentioned – will be able to put an end to discrimination and to call to account those countries that are lagging behind in terms of legislation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will start with a question. When will the EU finally take seriously the situation of its largest minority?</p>
      <p sl="en">Fifteen million people in Europe remain excluded from basic human rights, such as the right to education, employment or physical integrity, merely because they are Roma, or gypsies as most people still call them. One month ago two more countries joined the EU. The treatment given to Roma in these countries is far from fulfilling EU norms. As we know from the latest report of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the situation is not better in many of the old Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we talk about the migration of Roma, most of us call to mind pictures of poor, hunger-ridden people who come to disturb us in our comfortable existence, rather than remembering that they have rights. In 1999, under the Finnish Presidency, the EU adopted a recommendation to the Member States that specific attention should be given to the situation of minorities, in particular those who have no home country, meaning the Roma. The Commission has spent tens of thousands of euros for the improvement of the situation of Roma without developing a clear strategy and targeted approach, following the model of other intergovernmental organisations. Under these circumstances migration often becomes the last resort for Roma.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia recently gave us some worrying data that show that acts of racism and xenophobia against minorities are on the increase in Europe. The Roma, who form the largest ethnic minority in the European Union, are particularly targeted.</p>
      <p sl="it">A great deal of discrimination occurs in relation to work and the right to education, and the Roma often live in conditions of poverty, marginalised from society. Sometimes discrimination comes from the very institutions that ought to safeguard people’s rights. In a recent case in Slovenia, an entire group that had been living in that country for many years was removed from the area where it had been living for so long. I believe that we need to encourage the Roma to take part in social and political life, but for that to happen the Member States must first recognise them as an ethnic and linguistic minority. It would be necessary to get rid of the campsite system in favour of types of housing that would facilitate integration, thus eliminating any form of segregation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Roma have inherited a centuries-old culture, and I believe that we should have great respect for nomadic cultures. We owe to them the birth of what we call Western civilisation, which arose in Mesopotamia, now Iraq and under military occupation, inappropriately stirring up a war of civilisations. We are in debt to the Roma, even though, in my view, civilised Europe has often mistreated and discriminated against them.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must therefore support their social inclusion and freedom of movement. That is why I join my other fellow Members in calling on the Commission to take a more proactive stance – although I realise that Mr Almunia will probably not be able to give us any exhaustive answers since this is not his area of expertise – but we believe that the Commission ought to be moving faster on these issues.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the EU Race Directive is insufficiently effective in combating the multiple discrimination faced by Roma people. Speaking personally – and not reflecting necessarily the view of my group, which I have not consulted – I have come round to the view, like the Network of Independent Experts in Fundamental Rights, that we need a legislative instrument specifically aimed at protecting and promoting the equality of the Roma community. I do not say that lightly, because normally I am not keen on specific measures, but my understanding is that the European Commission is not keen on this idea, and in the absence of such a focused and targeted instrument, I think all we will ever do is talk.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Roma Rights Centre and the European Network against Racism pointed out recently, in a joint paper, that forced evictions, housing in extremely substandard conditions, denial of basic social and economic rights and school segregation are often instigated or condoned by local or regional government, and central governments have been ineffective in challenging them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Early this evening I had a question to the Council about the position of Roma people, and the response from the Presidency was essentially that, while anti-discrimination laws were an EU responsibility, social inclusion was a matter for national governments – a question of subsidiarity. Faced with that attitude, how will the Commission promote an effective pan-European programme of inclusion and equality of opportunity?</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I was hoping to get an answer from the Commissioner, but I see he is not scheduled to speak. On the website he was scheduled to reply to the debate, but here he is not. Are we getting a reply or not?</p>
