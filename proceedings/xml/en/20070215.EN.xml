      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0011/2007) by Cristobal Montoro Romero, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the EIB Annual Report for 2005 (2006/2269(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Investment Bank, the report we are debating today falls within the framework of dialogue between two European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">This dialogue is producing positive results, as demonstrated by the presence of the European Parliament, in a spirit of cooperation and appreciation of the important work of the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have been working on this report for months. We began on 20 June of last year and that work also involved our visit to the headquarters of the EIB in September.</p>
      <p sl="es">Also fruitful has been the work we have carried out with the various political groups, with all of those that have tabled amendments. We reached an agreement on the inclusion of those amendments with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, with the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and with the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. I would like publicly to thank those groups for their willingness to cooperate. This made it possible for the draft report to be approved unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 23 January.</p>
      <p sl="es">The EIB is doing a good job, and we take a positive view of it, within the context of a year like 2005, when the European economy was relatively stagnant and we had the sense that the structural component of our economy, its growth potential, was, in relative and comparative terms, lower than that of the other developed regions of the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an important approach to take when assessing the EIB’s economic actions. Those actions, ultimately aimed at enhancing the European Union’s physical resources in the form of infrastructures, make it possible to improve the Union’s growth potential. The new approach, which has been present in the EIB’s activities since 2005, geared towards small and medium-sized businesses – which unquestionably form the European Union’s backbone – is another positive approach, which we welcome and which will be implemented accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that the main focuses of its action, that is to say, to promote the European Union’s economic and social cohesion, the Innovation 2010 initiative, the protection of the environment, the development of the trans-European networks and the contribution to the European external cooperation and development aid policy, have been carried out in a satisfactory manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the report we introduce a first suggestion, which is to question whether the EIB has sufficient resources to implement such ambitious policies. As a public Bank, the EIB is comparatively small when compared to the public Banks of the countries making up the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the principal objectives, we advise the EIB to continue working particularly in the least-developed regions, with a view to promoting ‘catching up’. We also recommend that it focus its investment efforts on those less developed regions, on projects relating to innovation and the knowledge-based society.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our report also emphasises – of course – energy, the energy components, improving the security of supply and the freedom of the market. The EIB can contribute here as well. Also with regard to the funding of the trans-European networks, which are absolutely crucial — as I said earlier — to the structured development of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, with regard to foreign policy, we appeal to the EIB since we believe that the volume of loans granted to Latin America is insufficient, compared to external activities in other regions of the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the methods for intervention, we welcome the intensification of cooperation with the Commission on programmes that are already underway. We are pleased with the volume of resources allotted to small and medium-sized businesses, and we would insist that this is a fundamental aspect that we must continue to improve in the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must also stress the improvement in access to information and the transparency of operation, which the Bank is clearly improving. The report contains a positive assessment in this regard and also encourages the bank to continue with that transparency, genuinely subjecting its accounts to the Basel II criteria and, through better communication of its work, to provide its users with better information, beginning with the European Union’s financial intermediaries.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">The Commission is pleased with the fruitful dialogue that has taken place over recent years between the EIB and Parliament, which is reflected in this report by Mr Montoro that we are debating today, and to which the policy of transparency implemented by the Bank and its President, Mr Maystadt, has made a positive contribution.</p>
      <p sl="es">With the enlargement of the European Union involving 10 countries in 2004 and completed on 1 January of this year with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, with the greater interdependence of economies and within a context, in 2005, of budgetary fragility in most of the Member States, the European Investment Bank represented, in the year covered by this report, and still represents today, a fundamental instrument for responding to the ever-increasing funding demands to be met by the European Union’s policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is demonstrated by the new instruments implemented within the Union’s budgetary framework for 2007-2013, or the extension of the Bank’s external mandate approved by the Ecofin Council a few months ago. Notable amongst those instruments are the risk-sharing finance facility, which will enhance private sector investments in research and development through greater access to the Bank's funding, the guarantee instrument for the trans-European transport networks, or the contributions to the cohesion policy by means of the JASPER programme, in cooperation with the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, and the JESSICA programme, in cooperation with the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, the European Investment Fund, integrated into the EIB group, will increase its contribution to the Union’s objectives thanks to its involvement in the new European competitiveness and innovation programme, and also thanks to the increased opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses to access funding within the context of the JEREMIE programme, in conjunction with the Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the external field, the main feature of the European Investment Bank’s new external mandate is that it is being brought more into line with the Union’s external action priorities. In this regard, the Bank’s resources for action in the Mediterranean, by means of the FEMIP and in the neighbouring countries, by means of the new investment fund, and the tripartite agreement for action between the Commission, the EIB and the EBRD, have been strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="es">The EIB will also have greater resources for acting in areas such as Latin America and Africa. All of these developments are taken up in Mr Montoro’s report and the Commission sees them as extremely important and positive. They are all evidence of the central role played by the European Investment Bank in achieving the Union’s objectives and the constructive spirit of dialogue prevailing between Parliament and the Bank is therefore very good news.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can only add for my part, as Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Investment Bank, the Bank headed by Mr Maystadt, that cooperation has been excellent, and I hope it will continue to be so. I am sure that it will. And I am sure that this cooperation between Parliament and the Bank, between the Commission and the Bank, will make it easier for us to achieve our common objectives — those of the Commission and Parliament — for the future of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you Mr President, for as a newcomer to the Committee on Budgets, this is my first speech in this capacity. First of all, I would like to praise the European Investment Bank’s activity. In the course of 2005 they made more than 50% of their own loans accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ two thirds of the European labour force. I hope the JEREMIE programme, which has recently become operational, will reach its goal, namely, easier credit for micro, small and medium enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Similarly, the JASPERS programme will be of great assistance to Member States in the preparation of major projects. Of the three JASPERS regions covering the twelve new Member States, only the Warsaw centre has been inaugurated. Hopefully, the other two regions will also soon be activated, but I still cannot understand what the second region’s centre is doing in Vienna which is not even part of the programme, instead of choosing cities perfectly suitable for the tasks and concerned by the region’s activity, such as Budapest, Prague or Bratislava.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the matter of harmonising industrial objectives with environmental ones, Europe is not doing badly, though there is still work to do. In and of itself, one could even rejoice in the fact that 30-35% of bank loans were invested in projects targeting improvements in natural and built-up environments. However, 60% of these loans ended up in urban projects while only 20% remained for improving energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order to eliminate differences at Member State levels in the field of energy, the cooperation of the banking group is indispensable. Let me cite my own country, Hungary, as an example: according to the findings of Eurostat, of all the Central and Eastern European countries, the Hungarian State spends the least on energy saving and energy efficiency measures. Until 2013, a mere 10 billion Forints, as compared to the magnitude of 100 billion for gas-price subsidies. So we still have things to do together to improve the situation. Finally, I congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to commend Mr Montero Romero on the outstanding report that he has presented to us today; as he said, it obtained unanimous support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I should like, however, to highlight the positive view that Parliament has once again taken of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and in particular its governance model.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EIB has managed to enhance the quality of its activities while strengthening both the transparency of its operations and the openness and the loyalty with which it deals with other institutions, particularly the European Parliament. From time to time the EIB makes commitments to improving the quality of the services it provides and to meeting new interim targets as part of its fundamental mission; it has always succeeded in meeting these strategic objectives. We now hope that the EIB once again responds positively to the suggestions and recommendations made in this report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, it is very important that the Bank’s financial activities continue to be geared towards support for projects aimed at promoting energy efficiency and at developing renewable energy sources, with the Bank committing itself to attaining even higher levels. It must also be capable of significantly increasing support for economic and social activities outside the EU, namely in Africa, Latin America and in the Mediterranean associated countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the report says, the EIB cannot and should not compete with private intermediary financial institutions, when those institutions are ready and able to finance projects. It is essential, however, that the institution remain committed to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy on growth and employment and that it fulfil the specific, practical responsibilities arising from this commitment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore vital to strengthen its activities in funding infrastructure and in supporting the most vulnerable areas of manufacturing, which is now made up of the thousands of SMEs that operate in the European market and that create a substantial proportion of the jobs. One of the EU’s key missions is to foster economic and social inclusion and, as the Union’s financial institution, the EIB has a key role to play in achieving this objective. These are probably the most important messages that Parliament can and must use this opportunity to convey, given that support for the Bank’s activities and judgments on their quality are not, on this occasion, at issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I should like to join in congratulating the rapporteur warmly on this very good report, which has broad majority support in the committee. I should also like to congratulate the President of the European Investment Bank, who is here today. He represents the largest investment bank in the world. The EIB has a very good reputation, and the EU can be proud of the important role it plays on the world stage by virtue of this Bank. This is partly thanks to President Maystadt himself and his communicative role, whose influence is felt in the political sphere.</p>
      <p sl="de">My role as rapporteur for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – the key programme for innovation in Europe – has shown me how crucial the role of the EIB is for innovation. In the shape of JASPERS and JEREMIE, the Bank has launched further instruments to help it really build on innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We saw how the EIB also played a key role in reaching a compromise on the budget by virtue of the ‘Risk Sharing Finance Facility’ – I have to use these English terms, unfortunately – so warm thanks for this as well. We could not have adopted our budget without the Bank’s contribution.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to add, however – and this also goes for my fellow Members from Mediterranean countries – that we should pay more attention to innovation in the field of cohesion, too. Merely supporting cohesion will not help in the context of a Lisbon Strategy based on innovation. We must ensure that the focus of all projects is on innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EIB should also explore new paths. I should like to raise the issue of patents in this regard. Europe has very few patents compared with the USA, and, in particular, very expensive patents compared with China. In this context, the European Investment Bank could play a key role in funding patents for small and medium-sized enterprises. A conference was held on this subject recently, at which the EIB was represented via the European Investment Fund. The EIB and the EIF voiced their strong support for this, as did Parliament, but the Commission was a little hesitant. We must go down this route, however, if we are to raise awareness of innovation among SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to turn to the major issue of energy. I am delighted that the EIB has already assumed a prominent role in an issue that will be huge in coming years. The Bank supports a multitude of projects, particularly in the field of pipelines, and will continue to be crucial here in future, as our energy strategy can only be realised if the Bank retains an active, leading role in this field.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to mention the issue of projects outside the EU. The rapporteur calls for an increase in the funds for Latin America. This alone will not do. We must make it possible for the EIB to provide financing anywhere in the world where European strategic projects are being carried out – such as Beijing airport. This is of paramount importance to us Europeans. The EIB should be the anchor point of the European support landscape, and it is Mr Maystadt’s job to ensure that this is the case. The relationship between the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Council of Europe bank) must also be clarified.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur for the report’s comprehensive evaluation of the place of the European Investment Bank as the European Union’s financial institution in achieving Europe’s goals. The bank’s raison d’être is the promotion of business. New opportunities and tasks are emerging for the bank in European Union energy policy and in the Lisbon Strategy spheres of growth and employment, especially employment, where financial support has not been allocated for the tasks proposed. I would like to commend the bank’s decision to change direction in its policy on funding projects from quantity to quality; this will require more analytical work, but will definitely be better for the development of competitive business. The European Investment Bank’s refusal to participate in funding the Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, which has been viewed in conflicting lights, can be seen as a highly considered decision not to get involved in projects which weaken solidarity within European energy policy. The bank’s mission is and remains to foster the European Union’s economic and social cohesion. I endorse the request made in the report, with regard to economic and social cohesion, that the bank should concentrate on the least developed regions – Objective 1 regions. The bank has not always done this in implementing its loan policy. The bank’s activities to promote the inclusion of the least developed regions in the knowledge-based economy, and its endeavours to develop financial instruments that can be used to support small and medium-sized enterprises are especially to be endorsed. I welcome the fact that the bank has taken on the role of financial catalyst in the financing of Europe’s communications networks. In attracting private capital the bank’s participation in the financing of the connection of cross-border energy networks will be particularly important, where the complicated financing procedure makes it difficult to attract private capital. At the same time the bank could play a greater part in attracting private capital to various investment projects, by offering increased opportunities to assess investments in connection with projects in which the bank is participating or plans to participate. The development of the bank’s structure has not fully mirrored the European Union’s enlargement process and, as the report indicates, the bank has no permanent delegation in the Baltic Sea region. I agree with the request put forward in the report for the bank to improve its communication policy and to translate the main information on the bank’s website into all the European Union Member States’ languages. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it gives us great pleasure to examine once again this annual report, which our committee had little difficulty in adopting unanimously this year. All the major groups voted for it. The rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero proved open to all suggestions, including ours. This unanimity in our committee is a clear illustration of Parliament’s complete satisfaction with the European Investment Bank’s (EIB’s) attitude to us since 1999, when I had the honour of being Parliament’s first rapporteur on the Bank’s activities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It might be said that we have succeeded in establishing permanent links between our two institutions and in ensuring a symbiotic relationship between, on the one hand, the wishes of the MEPs, who often pass on requests from associations and NGOs, and, on the other, the policies of the EIB, which, on the basis of our recommendations, has increasingly come into line with the Gothenberg-Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This year, as well as noting that the objectives have in the main been met by the EIB, I should simply like to draw attention to the difficulties that we cause the Bank via our demands. Mention has just been made of the Baltic oil pipeline. It is true that as soon as we demand the highest security when it comes to sustainable development, decisions need to be made on our objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is another, more complex, problem. We ask the Bank to lend more to SMEs; in other words, we ask it to find operational provisions enabling small businesses and relay banks to implement the objectives that we set for the Bank.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Maystadt, I am permanent rapporteur for European Investment Bank loans and guarantees to the Committee on Budgets and would therefore like to make a few comments.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We have to bear in mind that the Bank’s primary task is to provide capital for projects in the Member States of the European Union. The Union supports loans to third countries, which may be regarded as part of the EU’s external policy. For that purpose, the EU gives the EIB a general mandate regarding guarantees for loans granted to external countries. Thanks to the EU’s guarantee, the aided countries receive loans at interest rates lower than those on the market. As for the view expressed in the report that the loans granted to countries in Latin America represent a small proportion of the total, I would point out that the EIB’s primary task is to finance projects within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When it approved the new mandate on guarantees for external loans in December, Parliament at the same time said it wanted to participate in the setting of priorities for loans. Parliament unanimously called for the legal basis of the mandate to be changed so that it would better reflect the nature of development aid and simultaneously give Parliament a voice in the setting of priorities. The Council was not prepared, however, to change the legal basis. It is the opinion of the Committee on Budgets that Parliament should therefore bring an action against the Council in the Court of the European Communities.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The committee’s report focuses attention on support for SMEs. They are effectively supported by the European Investment Fund, whose rise in share capital is at present being debated by Parliament. Parliament is likely to support the proposal, with the EIF’s share capital being increased in line with a suggestion by the Commission. That means that SMEs will get extra cash, which is one response to the demands made in this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, reading the Montoro Romero report, I see great praise for the EIB and its work. Sadly, I cannot share this enthusiasm. That sounds a bit ungrateful; after all, the UK, which is far from being one of the poorest nations, seems to do pretty well out of it.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2005, we received EUR 3.979 billion in loans, which is 9.4 % of the total loans made to projects in the Member States. But the truth is that Britain is being loaned a lot less than it pays into the EU. In 2005, even after deducting the rebate we paid GBP 3.6 billion into EU coffers; that is about EUR 5.4 billion. That is not exactly value for money.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have no problem with some of the projects being funded, such as the East London railway upgrade scheme, or improved water supplies here and there. But, of course, the wind farm off the Cumbrian coast is a waste of money.</p>
      <p sl="de">The point is, if Britain were not in the EU, it would be able to finance these schemes without any loans and with money to spare. So we would be a lot better off and we would not have to fly that wretched flag with its ring of stars.</p>

      <p sl="en">în numele grupului ITS . – Apreciez raportul profesorului Cristobal Montoro Romero ca fiind unul remarcabil dovedind un înalt profesionalism, echidistanţă şi determinare în analiză şi prezentare. În aceiaşi termeni consider şi raportul privind activitatea desfăşurată în anul 2005 de către Banca Europeană de Investiţii pe care, îl apreciez ca fiind unul care îţi lasă, după lecturare, o stare de bine. Remarcabil este faptul că autorii s-au străduit şi au izbutit să prezinte de o manieră clară, atât activitatea desfăşurată în perioada de referinţă, cât şi programele de perspectivă menite să răspundă marilor provocări actuale cu care se confruntă Uniunea Europeană şi nu numai. Din lipsă de timp o să mă limitez doar la câteva remarci în legătură cu unul dintre aceste programe, şi anume cel referitor la promovarea coeziunii economice şi sociale în interiorul Uniunii Europene, în special în zonele puţin dezvoltate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Un program generos, însă, fiindcă există un însă, având în vedere că raportul face referiri şi la zonele mai puţin dezvoltate ale spaţiului european, din care face parte şi România, m-aş fi aşteptat ca programul să conţină de o manieră mai concretă şi un eventual sistem de facilităţi precum termene de graţie, dobânzi încurajatoare şi altele, care să permită ţărilor din aceste zone recuperarea mai rapidă a decalajelor în vederea accelerării procesului de integrare în Uniunea Europeană.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, failure is often the best teacher. This debate comes at a good time for the EIB. In recent weeks, the subject that will presumably be the chief preoccupation of the next generation, or generations, has taken its place at the very top of the political agenda at long last: climate change. In this connection, I should like to suggest that the EIB review all its activities to identify the projects still receiving its support that we already know will rebound on us in the end on account of climate change. In what areas can the EIB be significantly more active? Here I am of course referring to the energy action plan in paragraph 6 of this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">A much more fundamental approach can be taken to this. The EIB has a unique opportunity to make it quite clear that there are far-sighted European projects, too. Renewable energy is an infinitely large field, as is transport. The institution should advertise the fact that it saw the light in time on this, so that we can say in 10-15 years’ time that, back then, the EIB was indeed forward-looking in the loans it supported.</p>
      <p sl="de">This brings me to paragraphs 19 and 21 of the report. I would ask the EIB to ensure that the funds do reach the final beneficiaries rather than seeping away or becoming stuck in intermediary banks. I ask it to concern itself with the environmental framework. Incidentally, it is my opinion that we are in urgent need of less EU red tape and more democracy.</p>

I hope that he also understands that the three additional amendments we have tabled are additions to and not criticisms of his report, in particular Amendment 2, which deals with the current problem of combining funds that are considered under the state aid rules and funding from the EIB. This is a problem that I think is worthwhile tackling. Therefore, I hope these amendments will be adopted.</p>

We all must confront one basic challenge, namely, the modernisation of the internal market of an expanded Europe. I would say that the internal market of Europe can be characterised by the popular economic term 'transition economy'. Such economies are typified by uncertainty, risk, new challenges and a rapidly changing situation. I consider, therefore, that the European Investment Bank needs to be bolder in offering new financial instruments, and I would like to emphasise that the European Investment Bank operates in this direction in the fields of both borrowing and investing, especially in non-euro countries.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Another aspect of importance to 'transition economies', which I know from my own experience, is that it is necessary to teach market participants how to use these instruments. A good many projects – very good projects – go unfunded from lack of knowledge. I would like to mention the well known Jeremy project for small enterprises, and the Jasper and Jessica projects. These will not be effective unless the Bank, which has acquired a large amount of information, shares this information and pays significant attention to technical support. Perhaps the Bank's remoteness, requiring it to operate through representatives in the regions, does not permit the Bank's input to be felt at the level of the ordinary citizen, the small enterprise or the small city. I hope that the Bank will value the opportunity of making its solutions more accessible to individual citizens and regions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to endorse the rapporteur’s favourable assessment of the European Investment Bank’s activities during 2005. For some time now, the bank has endeavoured to implement projects in line with the Lisbon Strategy, and I believe the positive effects of these projects will be felt in the near future. Nonetheless, I should like to make a few comments concerning the EIBs activities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, I must point out that the fundamental aim of the EIB is to support social and economic cohesion throughout the Member States of the European Union. Accordingly, a significant proportion of the bank’s funds should be devoted to the poorest regions of the European Union. Nonetheless, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, in the course of the last four years, and including 2005, the inverse was the case. The so-called Objective II regions received most of the support, to the detriment of the less economically developed Objective I regions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, there is a marked tendency on the part of the EIB to support the southern regions of the European Union, at the expense of its eastern ones. The same is true in the case of countries that are not members of the Union. The bank can be rightly proud of the many projects undertaken within the framework of the so-called Mediterranean neighbourhood policy, but I was unable to find a single project undertaken within the framework of the eastern neighbourhood policy on the bank’s web site.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My last comment concerns the assessment of the effectiveness of projects undertaken by the bank. It seems clear to me that the bank should undertake ex post assessment of the results it achieves, measured in terms of economic growth and job creation. In particular, I agree with the rapporteur that making information and analysis on unsuccessful projects available could be helpful. It could identify indicators that would be useful to the bank when making decisions on the implementation of further projects in the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as I have just one minute, I shall concentrate on the issue of energy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the Bank can help us to retrieve some credibility at European level, but we must stop beating about the bush when it comes to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to propose to you that four specific initiatives be put to the March Summit: firstly, a significant European fund for renewing the European home – 50% of European gas is used to heat poorly insulated houses; a fund for modernising public lighting in Europe, leading to the replacement in just three years of six to eight polluting coal-fired power plants; a fund to aid European cities, leading to investment in public transport, because if we do not change our policy on big cities, it will not be possible to change European transport policy; and fourthly, the Bank's involvement in projects aimed at turning the North Sea, which is currently devoted to gas and oil, into a sea dedicated to offshore activities and then, in turn, to sea power.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have the resources. Help us to give the European citizens back their hope.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to raise the issue of China’s investment activities in Africa, which is crying out for a debate on the European Investment Bank’s lending conditions. As Mr Maystadt rightly said, in November last year, this is a major issue to which the international financial community should respond. Competitive lending is an undesirable phenomenon, since its eventual effect is to reduce all conditions on loans to a minimum, at least provided that there are any conditions left in the areas of democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Does the EIB think it might join with the international financial community in bringing pressure to bear on China? Considerations of human rights and democracy should not be made secondary to short-term economic gain, not even in Chinese credit policy in respect of Africa. While this House, in a resolution on relations with China, is making a powerful plea in favour of freedom and human rights, we would lose our credibility if we were not to prescribe these requirements as conditions for loans in the African countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">The Treaty of Rome established the EIB as a financial institution aimed at achieving common objectives.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, the Innovation 2010 Initiative responds to the Lisbon Strategy’s commitment to making Europe a knowledge-based economy by means of operations in various areas, in particular the training of human capital.</p>
      <p sl="es">In 2005, loans were granted for education and training in the sum of EUR 2.3 billion. The amendment that I presented in committee insisted that the funding of educational projects should not be restricted exclusively to higher education, but that it should be extended to other fields.</p>
      <p sl="es">The culture of innovation must reach all levels of European education and be instilled in all of the Union’s citizens from childhood. It is a good thing, for example, that there should be financial support for pilot projects in primary education.</p>

    <intervention id="4-025" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Philippe Maystadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Investment Bank">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should first like to thank your rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero for his extremely thorough analysis of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB). Mr Montoro Romero put in a great deal of personal effort: he came to the Bank, asked a great many questions and, with the help of his colleagues, has produced a report that gets to the very kernel of the EIB's strategic objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These strategic objectives are encapsulated perfectly in the motion for a resolution, and I can inform you that the Bank unreservedly accepts the recommendations contained therein. As regards the priorities covered in paragraphs 2 to 10 of the motion for a resolution, we shall be pursuing our activities according to the proposed guidelines, including in the field of energy. The latter was rightly addressed by a number of speakers, and I can tell you that in the Business Plan for the next three years, we have decided to lend at least EUR 4 billion per year for energy-related projects, including at least EUR 800 million for renewable energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, we have set ourselves one rule, which will, admittedly, not be easy to observe, but this is the rule we have set ourselves: we want at least half of the new production capacity for electricity that we shall be called on to fund to be linked to renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A further axis of our activities in the area of energy will of course be that of improving energy efficiency. I have taken note of Mr Turmes’ specific proposals. I can tell him that, in several Member States, we are already funding social housing renovation programmes so as to improve energy efficiency, and are naturally ready to broaden our activities in this area, which, as you said, is crucial to our future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Still on the recommendations in the first part of the motion for a resolution, mention is made of the EIB’s representation in the Nordic countries, an issue also raised by Mr Krats. I can confirm to him that the EIB has in principle taken a decision to open a representative office in the Nordic countries. The interested Member States are working together and once an agreement has been reached between them, we shall be opening the office.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Whilst on the subject of the EIB’s external offices, I noted Mr Olajos’ question about the EIB’s new offices in regions particularly affected by the Jaspers programme. We have decided to open three new offices. The first, in Warsaw, is already open, and the two others, in Bucharest and Vienna, will be open in the next two months. Mr Olajos wondered why Vienna had been chosen; he mentioned other possibilities, such as Budapest, Prague and Bratislava. Vienna was chosen because the Member States concerned were not able to reach agreement, and so Vienna appeared as the compromise choice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To return now, more systematically, to the different forms of cooperation with the Commission mentioned by Mr Almunia, I wish to say to you that there are three important new initiatives: the Jeremie Programme, which is a very original programme for transforming the structural funds into renewable financial instruments; the Jaspers Programme to which I have already alluded, which is a form of technical assistance to help identify and prepare major projects that can be financed by the structural funds; and lastly, the Jessica Programme in the area of urban renewal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, still with the Commission, we have finalised a new guarantee fund for funding trans-European networks and a research facility, as mentioned by Mr Katzimarkakis, which forms part of the new financial instruments that Mrs Starkevičiūtė was seeking. This is just one example of innovations in the area, and should enable us, I repeat, to act, in conjunction with the Commission, as a lever to help markedly increase funding for research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A number of speakers mentioned the role that the European Investment Fund could play. The Fund will expand still further with support for SMEs thanks to increased capital currently in preparation and thanks to an extra envelope of EUR 1 billion, via the ‘competitiveness and innovation' framework programme, leading to more innovative financial products benefiting new-start small businesses in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are the remarks I wanted to make, Mr President. I can in any event confirm to you that, having read the motion for a resolution very carefully, we are prepared to implement its recommendations. Furthermore, if Parliament so wishes, we would be ready to draw up a report in one year’s time on the state of play regarding the implementation of these recommendations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I should first like to commend the excellent report by my Spanish colleague, Mr Montoro Romero, on the annual report of the European Investment Bank (EIB).</p>
      <p sl="fr">I support his proposals aimed at expanding the role of our public bank in order to facilitate the functioning of the internal market and to enhance the Union’s external role. I am disappointed, however, by the scant mention of financial aspects, in particular the reasons why the Member States have not released their contribution to the capital, amounting to EUR 155 billion. This situation leads to an obvious lack of capital and in turn to a lack of scope for action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Bank owes its outstanding marks solely to the fact that its stakeholders are the 27 EU Member States and that it enjoys Community budget guarantees on a great many of its financial commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this subject, I cannot explain why this Community guarantee is not always paid back transparently, transparency being an objective of the Bank praised in the report. It will be interesting to examine the Bank's voluntary implementation of the solvency ratio (Bâle II), the method used to implement it, and the aggregates making up this ratio.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0001/2007) by Manuel António dos Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the macro-economic impact of the increase in the price of energy (2006/2247(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-030" speaker_id="21918" name="Manuel dos SANTOS" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Portugal" birth_date="05-12-1943" birth_place="Mirandela" p_group="Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament" m_state="PT">
      <p sl="pt">I should like to begin by thanking all the MEPs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the draftsmen of the opinions of the various committees that have delivered opinions on this report for the support and the high-quality contributions that they have provided. I should also like to thank Mr Almunia for his encouragement on various occasions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, we recently heard the Commission President say in Parliament that Europe cannot aspire to speak to the world with one voice on energy policy when, internally, it is utterly incapable of speaking with 27 voices. This is also probably the most important message contained in the report before us, and this message has a clear target: the European Council and the Member States, and the Spring Summit in Brussels on 8 and 9 March is an appropriate date for that message to be heard. The time has therefore come to move from mere statements of intent to action, a change of attitude that must take place now or it will never happen.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Now is clearly not the best time for us to go into a detailed analysis of the nature, the causes and the consequences of the various energy crises that we have suffered. The report has much to say on these issues and even if it did not we would all still be able to recall the distinguishing features of each of the four oil crises that the European economy has had to contend with in the past 50 years. It is clear that both from the point of view of the new economic paradigm – what might be termed ‘globalisation’ – and from the political and strategic perspective – what might be termed the ‘absence of multilateralism’ – the situation today is vastly different from what it was in the middle of last century. Yet it is precisely for that reason that we must be intelligent and humble enough to acknowledge that different problems always require different solutions and that the most complex problems require the most ambitious and radical solutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is undeniable that the turbulence we have seen in the energy markets and the volatility of prices has led to slower economic growth and to steeper price rises. It is also unthinkable that these setbacks have not been made worse by intense speculative activity around the price of raw materials in the energy sector. It is obvious that strongly integrated economic areas, as, fortunately, is the case of the EU, are able in the short term to absorb shocks and to pursue their main objectives by implementing their economic policies appropriately. Yet it is also true that the slowdown in the pace of growth and the loss of competitiveness are inevitably reflected in fewer jobs being created; moreover, the current lack of job creation will never be offset by the jobs that may be created in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU is made up of Member States with differing growth rates and manufacturing structures, and accordingly their levels of dependency are very different. The difficulties experienced by some Member States will always have to be added to the global difficulties experienced and be paid for by the whole economic and political area to which they belong.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission has warned us of an unavoidable outcome unless measures are taken immediately. Europe’s dependency in this sector will increase to unsustainable levels by 2030, and we all know that such dependency will come at a price, in terms of not only the economic impact but also the political and strategic relations that will become entrenched in the years ahead.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The issue of energy is therefore one of central importance for the future of Europe and it is above all a political issue requiring political and Europe-wide responses and commitments. Even the more technical issues, such as the discovery and development of new alternatives and the creation of interlinked regulation systems, can only be successfully addressed if approached from a supranational perspective, without which it will be impossible to mobilise the enormous financial resources needed for research and development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore suggested that the Union, via its institutions, engage in a global debate on the issue designed to generate interest among the economic agents, the bodies representing the sector and the citizens. It should then go on to assess the true impact of using different energy sources, and the possible combinations thereof, on economic growth, on environmental protection and on reducing the detrimental effect on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At this stage, as recent events have shown, the Member States on their own are not in a position to tackle these problems. What is needed is a proper, shared European energy policy, as the Commission has suggested, although that will depend entirely on the Council saying that it wants one. As we know, not only is the EU dangerously dependent on the energy it imports, but it also has not, as a whole, guaranteed the security of production of the energy it needs to meet its objectives of growth and the well-being of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Much can be done inside the European area, through energy savings, promoting efficiency, diversifying sources and protecting the environment. Yet the crucial objective can only be achieved via dialogue with all of the other regions of the world, including both those that are predominantly energy producers and those that consume increasing amounts of that energy. The EU’s foreign policy in this new century needs to incorporate the energy dimension as a priority, and for this to be successful it should be based on three essential axes: solidarity with the EU and its structural principles and values, solidarity with developing countries and solidarity with the environmental dimension of the world in which we live and without which we cannot survive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By adopting this report, Parliament will, as on previous occasions, be demonstrating its desire and honouring its responsibility to take action in an area that is essential to the citizens’ well-being, in spite of all the difficulties. We would like to hope that the Spring Summit of the Heads of State or Government is characterised by progress and is not limited to well-meaning statements that do not solve any of the current problems and that only serve to create or store problems for the future.</p>

    <intervention id="4-031" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">I would like to begin by congratulating and thanking Mr dos Santos and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is a very complete report in terms of its content and it is particularly timely when the European Council of 8 March is about to discuss a broad energy package approved by the Commission in January.</p>
      <p sl="es">That package includes a proposal for a global European strategy capable of taking on the challenge of guaranteeing the energy supply while at the same time combating climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fact that, over recent weeks and months, the oil price has fallen back from maximum levels of close to 80 dollars per barrel, which it reached last summer during the Lebanon crisis, does not mean that the main conclusions and recommendations contained in the report are no longer as relevant.</p>
      <p sl="es">Those conclusions and recommendations place the emphasis on the structural factors that have led to the recent price levels, or current price levels. These factors are undoubtedly going to remain in place.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, in view of the growth and inflation figures for 2006, which have been released over recent days, it is worth stressing how well the European economy has reacted in general to the volatility and rises in oil prices this year.</p>
      <p sl="es">I agree with the concerns expressed in the report with regard to the consequences of the increase in prices, but it is also the case that, over recent months, those consequences have been less serious than we had feared and than those that we have seen in previous cases of sharp increases in oil prices.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is something that should be stressed. It is linked to the debate we held yesterday in this House on the Bullmann and Andersson reports. It is significant that, at a time when the European Council is going to discuss both this energy strategy and climate change package and the Lisbon Strategy, our European economies have experienced a period of sharp oil price increases and that, at the same time, economic growth has sped up without any particularly worrying tensions in prices.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I said yesterday in this House, this is not the result of chance, it is the result of efforts made over recent years to make the functioning of Europe’s markets in goods, services, capital and labour more efficient, and it is the result, beyond the cyclical element of the current economic situation, of the positive results that we are beginning to see thanks to the structural reforms already carried out, and thanks to the budgetary consolidation efforts of recent years.</p>
      <p sl="es">This message must reach the citizens loud and clear so that public opinion may be in a position, on the one hand, to appreciate the importance of the efforts that we have asked them to make so far, and, on the other, to better understand and accept the efforts that have still to be made in order to ensure that the improvements that we are now beginning to see become structural improvements and allow us to look to the future with more confidence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, I would say once again that this better behaviour of the economy does not make the report and the conclusions and recommendations of the report by Mr dos Santos, in particular, any less relevant in terms of the functioning of the energy market and the impact of energy consumption on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must not ignore a series of factors. For example, that Europe’s energy supply is dependent on geopolitical factors, which are not entirely in our hands. For example, that the low level of interconnection of our gas and electricity energy networks makes us more vulnerable to those geopolitical factors and to tensions in supply, such as those we have seen this winter and the winter before.</p>
      <p sl="es">For example, that that low level of interconnection, together with other factors of a national nature, make it impossible for a genuine internal energy market to emerge. This harms consumers, who pay more for energy, receive lower quality energy and have less security in terms of receiving that energy at acceptable prices and quality.</p>
      <p sl="es">Or, for example, that the amount of CO2 that we continue to emit into the atmosphere is exacerbating the greenhouse effect and the consequences of that effect in terms of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my view, the response to the problems and challenges referred to in the report, some elements of which I have just listed, can largely be found in the proposals included in the energy package approved by the Commission in January and which is going to be one of the principal issues to be discussed at the European Council of 8 and 9 March.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our proposals cover both economic and environmental aspects, security aspects stemming from our energy dependency and proposals to improve the efficiency of energy use. In this regard, I believe that they are essentially in line with the considerations and recommendations contained in the report by Mr dos Santos.</p>
      <p sl="es">All we need to do is move on from debate to action. The citizens are aware of the challenges we have to face. At the forthcoming European Council, the Heads of State or Government must now provide the necessary political impetus to implement a genuine European energy strategy such as the one put forward by the Commission in its proposal, and like the one that this Parliament has been calling for repeatedly, in today's report and in other reports and resolutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr dos Santos for his report. On behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I welcome a heightened interest in these issues, but let us please be cautious about trying to solve all issues in the energy field in this report which, as I understand it, is primarily about oil prices and oil volatility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first point I would like to make relates to the precedent of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, when a substantial increase in real terms had a big effect on the economy, but the world financial markets coped with those changes and the recessionary effects were relatively short-lived. The increases today in proportion, in real terms, are not as great, and therefore should not give us such concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is new are the different suppliers in the marketplace, and in particular Russia and the Russian policy on this matter. I have great confidence in the markets. I think that they will cope with changes in demand in the foreseeable future, but that is a very short period of time and our concerns should be more about security of supply; about getting enough supply, whether it is within Europe or imported; about a depletion of reserves; and about the sustainability angle, with reference to climate change and our emissions. Those are very important and we must remember that we do have alternatives to oil, but we need to develop them to a marketable stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would be very cautious about trying to increase the proportion of oil stocks from 90 to 120 days. I do not think 30 days more will make any difference. This House voted strongly against a proposal from the Commission to that effect in the last Parliament. I wonder whether our main concern is really fear about price changes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the oil price increase, notably in 2006, has of course resulted in price increases, which have not helped Europe’s economic upturn. This is undisputable. It would be going too far to speak of a recession, however, as the rapporteur would have liked.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report is one year old, and I am very much obliged to Mr dos Santos for incorporating our contributions into the report now present. This means that we have eliminated all our differences on this and acted according to the state of affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to this subject, what we need is not heated debates, but rather a sober analysis. The oil price increase has naturally led to certain increases in production costs. Yet it is wrong to assume a direct link between energy prices and competitiveness on this account. After all – as the Commissioner has just said – the increase in the price of fossil fuels has been universal, and thus the competitive starting position of our competitors has been equally affected.</p>
      <p sl="de">Oil prices are calculated in US dollars. In this connection, I warmly welcome the fact that the European Central Bank is proceeding with caution in monetary matters whilst remaining vigilant. Yet it must be borne in mind that rising oil prices promise oil-producing companies an increase in profit. This, in turn, leads to the development of more areas, to increased supply and ultimately to a fall in prices – which is what we have seen in the last six months. If the situation in Iraq were more peaceful, the uncertainties in Iran removed and the Caspian Sea oil flowing, the outlook for the medium term would be better.</p>
      <p sl="de">How can we improve the organisation of our energy supply in future? This will be discussed shortly – with our participation – and an objective analysis will help in this discussion. As we know, Europe relies heavily on fossil fuels – of which there are few sources in Europe – and so it is desirable to develop renewable energies. Developing these at all costs, however, will have the same negative impact as rising oil prices, as the cost of these new technologies will be passed on to the final consumer. This will mean less money in the Member States’ coffers for other fields.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need more investment in research and development to make renewable energy supplies more competitive and ready for the market. In terms of the energy issue, this is the only course of action that will help the European economy. If I may make an additional comment on the medium-term outlook: the situation regarding China will become clear in the medium term. Looking at the progression of its economy, particularly the automobile industry, China will need as much energy for its cars by 2030 as is being produced today.

      <p sl="mt">I hope that by today's discussions we are not simply contributing to the hot air generated by emissions, but rather aiming at coming up with solutions to the problems. I believe that the dos Santos report points us in the right direction. Obviously, we must focus on the economic problems, but the main point that I would like to stress is that, ultimately, these economic problems lead to social problems. For many countries this oil price crisis has ultimately led to a greater financial burden on those who can least shoulder it. I would like to quote Malta's case as an example, where the authorities' lack of planning has led to a 45% surcharge on water and electricity bills. I also believe that we must start thinking outside the box and look beyond the framework we have been confined to up until now. These new prices have led to certain solutions that until recently did not make any economic sense. However, now they do make sense and we must pay more attention to them than we did previously. We must therefore concentrate on the root of the problem rather than on its effects. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent rise in the cost of energy has reached unexpected proportions. The rising price of energy is pushed up further by the increased requirement for energy resources of new major market participants, especially China. Furthermore, energy resources are made more expensive by the increased cost of their production, and by the geopolitical instability of petroleum-exporting regions. Rising costs are also influenced by Russia's policy of using energy as an instrument for exerting economic and political pressure on its trading partners. This year, world petroleum prices have increased by almost 15%. In addition to the factors I have already mentioned, other influencing factors were the OPEC decision to reduce petroleum production, and unexpectedly cold weather in the USA.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As mentioned in the report, energy price increases, as an external factor, caused repercussions in the economies of various EU countries, both in the euro zone and among the new member countries. My country, Lithuania, whose economy depends very much on the import of energy resources, exceeded the Maastricht inflation criterion by 0.07% due to an unexpected rise in energy prices and, therefore, failed to become a member of the euro zone, as it was hoping to do from the beginning of this year. Increases in the cost of energy resources cannot really be predicted, and this will have an influence on the possible admission dates of candidates to the euro zone, apparently pushing them further into the future.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Do we just observe the influence of rising energy costs on the EU economy or do we need to draw conclusions from it? If the price increases were sudden and unexpected, and objective, then why are just the member countries being blamed for the consequences? Europe only started talking about a common energy policy after the Ukraine-Russia crisis of 2006. The conflict between Belarus and Russia at the beginning of this year over natural gas and petroleum appears to be successfully resolved for the moment.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is pleasing that the report contains a whole chapter urging Europe to act now and invest in innovation, the energy infrastructure, renewable forms of energy, technology platforms and a transition to clean energy. I am of the opinion that, given the energy situation in the EU and the world, and our concern not just about the prices but also about the influence on climate change, we should also discuss the use of safe nuclear energy as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Euratom this year.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The author of the report urges that the greatest priority be given to the creation of an energy market for Europe proper and the Mediterranean basin. What is 'Europe proper'? What ever happened to neighbourhood policy, embracing cooperation not only with Mediterranean countries but also with the eastern neighbours of the EU? Why is the European Union negotiating with Russia, trying to arrange a new Treaty of Cooperation between the EU and Russia? Do we decline to accept Russian petroleum and natural gas since we do not have a common EU energy market? I believe that the new eastern EU member countries find the author’s narrow view unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I feel that, in some respects, we have a strong agreement on the structural nature of energy price increases. In this regard, I welcome the contribution of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which expressed its opinion extremely clearly and supported the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where we disagree, including in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is on the speculative aspect that has been added to this Structural Fund. From that point of view, I very much endorse the words of Mrs Budreikaitė, and hope that she can persuade her group to withdraw the amendment disputing the speculative element on the volatility of the price of energy. We need to take measures to combat volatility. We must at least eliminate the speculative element of movements in the price of energy, and are capable of so doing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being said, we must be aware of the particularly serious impact of the structural rise in the price of oil. A grass is invading the planet, namely the African palm, a cereal crop used in biofuel or biodiesel production, which will lead to the price of food being linked to the price of energy. This is an unacceptable risk that we cannot afford to run.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For years we have been wondering how to ensure that workers do not suffer from the second wave of the effects of oil on the cost of living. If, by dint of an extraordinary misfortune, the policy of developing biofuels were to lead to competition with food production policy, the result would certainly be a link between the price of food and the price of energy, and that would be the most terrible disaster.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, why are we still using oil to drive cars and heat homes? With increasing global demand for oil, the deterioration of the stability of the Middle East, particularly with the possibility of an Iranian war looming and with the search for oil becoming more difficult and expensive as the biggest oil fields play out, why do we not reserve oil for essential uses like some plastics or jet fuels, and use sustainable alternatives in motoring, home heating, electricity generation and other applications that are possible to substitute?</p>
      <p sl="de">We will in fact get to the point where we reserve our oil, but will we do it far-sightedly and voluntarily or because prices force us? What will decide the question? Well, the answer lies in the way we support European R[amp]D and the way we scale up European production of alternatives, not in the way we take alternative oils from other countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, as we debate energy prices and energy security today, we must bear in mind that high fuel prices are due not only to increased demand for oil the world over, but also to the situation in the Middle East and the war in Iraq. I am a member of the League of Polish Families, and my party was opposed to that war from the very beginning. Many families and households across Europe are now feeling the negative consequences of high energy prices, and the prospect that prices will remain high in the foreseeable future is resulting in fundamental economic changes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The suggestion that current minimum European Union duties on diesel oil might be increased from 2012 is also cause for concern. That type of solution, and the harmonisation of provisions, so typical of Union bureaucracy, neither fosters improved competition, nor does it help to eliminate the differences between European countries. Instead of working on raising prices, the European Commission would be better employed supporting alternative sources of energy, energy saving technologies and renewable sources of energy. It should also devote itself to improving energy security for the whole of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In connection with the report of my fellow Member Mr dos Santos, I would like to draw your attention to one of the key questions in European energy policy. In the course of the present debate on European energy policy there are frequent mentions of the noble goal, also contained in the report: within the next few years the European Union must complete its own internal energy market. There is, however, one vital prerequisite for this to happen: that a healthy, undistorted competition should govern the markets within individual Member States as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Unfortunately, however, the recent sector review by the European Commission demonstrates that the European energy market is made up of over-centralised national markets. The old monopolies are still such dominant players today that they dictate or at least strongly influence prices.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In Hungary in the 1990s, the incumbent MVM Company Ltd. and the newly privatised electric energy producers signed long-term electricity purchase agreements. These agreements, due to expire between 2010 and 2020, cover about 80% of the Hungarian electrical energy production market, thereby seriously hampering the liberalisation of the market and keeping consumer prices unreasonably high. The price that MVM pays most generating plants for the contracted energy supply seems considerably higher than the wholesale price MVM would pay if power generating plants had to compete with each other. The legal provision for renegotiating these agreements has not led to any result so far, and so the unsatisfactory functioning of the energy market continues to cause serious disadvantages to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, a real internal energy market is crucially important for reaching the goals of Europe’s energy policy. Free market competition reduces costs for citizens and businesses, promotes energy efficiency, encourages investment and also contributes to supply security. All Member States must therefore dismantle market impediments without delay.</p>

      <p sl="en">Уважаема г-жо Председател, уважаеми г-н Комисар, уважаеми членове на Европейския парламент, обсъждаме проблем, който има изключително въздействие върху развитието на световната икономика, като особено засегнати са по-слабо развитите страни, включително новите страни-членки на Европейския съюз, чиито икономики са по-енергоемки.</p>
      <p sl="en">Като социалисти, не можем да не подчертаем, че повишаващите се цени на енергията засилват социалните трудности и социалната несигурност сред гражданите на Съюза. Макар и с известно закъснение, Европейският съюз трябва да предприеме редица мерки в дългосрочен и в краткосрочен план, за да преодолее енергийната си зависимост, както по отношение на количествата, така и по отношение на цената на внасяната енергия и енергоносители.</p>
      <p sl="en">Важно е да бъдат подкрепени политически и финансово големите инфраструктурни проекти, които ще диверсифицират източниците и ще увеличат входните трасета за внос на петрол и газ. Увеличаването на дела на възобновяемите източници на енергия и използването на биогорива трябва да бъде подкрепено, но процесът ще бъде бавен и подходът ни трябва да бъде много прагматичен.</p>
      <p sl="en">Бих искал да дам пример с енергийната криза, пред която са изправени Западните Балкани. Острият недостиг на електроенергия в някои от страните е съчетан с предсрочно затваряне на два доказано безопасни ядрени реактора в България, което е необяснимо от икономическа гледна точка. Надявам се, докладът dos Santos да бъде подкрепен, защото изпълнението на предложените в него мерки ще допринесе за икономическата стабилност, социалната сигурност и външнополитическата тежест на Европейския съюз и на страните-членки.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Europe's energy dependency is expected to rise from 50% at the moment to 71% in 2030, energy price increases are a fact of life and are here to stay. I welcome this excellent own-initiative report, which makes it abundantly clear that Europe must, as a matter of urgency, take proactive, coherent action.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The development of the internal market for energy has not eliminated existing distortions, as demonstrated by the Commission’s inquiry into the sector. Accordingly, Community regulation of this market needs to be improved by monitoring existing production and distribution structures, and strengthening links between countries. These are some of the conditions that must be in place if we are to increase efficiency in the energy market. It is crucial that the energy efficiency plan recently put forward by the Commission be adopted, as it addresses all of these issues.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Among the amendments to the report that I have tabled, I should like to highlight those relating to energy efficiency, which should be included in the award criteria in tendering procedures and in the selection processes for the support generated under the Structural Funds and in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. Better energy efficiency is the best response to the problem of climate change, along with control of atmospheric emissions and enhanced European energy independence.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I simply wish to add a few words summarising a debate that I believe to be extremely important and relevant, relating to the report by Mr dos Santos.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no doubt that we will continue to talk about energy and we will continue to talk about it in direct relation to climate change and the strategy required to combat it. Energy policy cannot be separated from environmental policy. They form part of the same strategy. I believe that from a debate such as today’s, and other debates that we have held and that we will continue to hold on these issues, today’s more focussed on prices, others on other important aspects of this strategy, the conclusion is — at least this is my conclusion, and I believe that the majority of Members of this Parliament will agree with me — that action at European level, a common European policy, is essential.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is a field in which European-level action demonstrates, when it is discussed, and will demonstrate, when we communicate it to the citizens, the added value of European Union action for the coming years and decades. From the point of view of security of supply, from the point of view of the sustainability required of any policy in the field of energy, and from the point of view of the quest for greater competitiveness within a context in which energy prices are unfortunately not going to be as low as they have been in the past, from all points of view, action at European Union-level is essential.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall therefore conclude this debate, Madam President, by joining in the appeal that many of you have made this morning for more decisive action, firstly by the European Council of 8 March and, on that basis, by all of the European institutions, to achieve objectives such as those laid out in the report by Mr dos Santos.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The increase in the price of energy, in spite of favourable parity between the euro and the dollar, remains a factor in the European economy’s instability. It also reflects our economy’s excessive dependence on oil, the price of which has shot up whilst the prices of other forms of energy have remained stable or have risen by less.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must take account of a complex situation and effect a political response revolving around the following points. The first is the emergence of European energy leaders, because they alone are capable of negotiating on an equal footing with our main suppliers for the benefit of our Member States. They must be able to go on concluding long-term contracts so as to secure supplies and to cushion heavy investment. Finally, they must not be weakened by the recommending of all-out separation of assets as a factor of competitiveness in the market. Such separation does not make for competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point is promotion of a genuine energy mix based on renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, energy efficiency and increased budgets for research into the energies of the future such as ITER.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Preparing for the post-oil era, these policies will enable the Union to remain competitive while ensuring generally affordable energy supplies for its economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, due to the late addition of this item to the agenda, my colleague Mr McCreevy is unable to be here today and I shall present his considerations. I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, in particular, the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mr Klinz for their excellent work on this file.</p>
      <p sl="en">The compromise package that is now on the table contains very effective solutions to the problems that we have identified, without imposing excessive burdens. These problems, which led the Commission to submit its proposal, were in principle very simple: at the moment shareholders do not receive information on general meetings in time, they face restrictions on trading their shares for a certain time period ahead of the meeting if they want to vote and they often have to go in person to general meetings, even if those meetings take place in another Member State, as there are no effective rules on representation and distant voting. Together with Parliament and the Council, we managed to find simple solutions to these simple problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we cannot stop there. In particular, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs pointed out, in its opinion of November 2006, other issues that need to be addressed if we want to make the general meeting work efficiently and if we want to further improve the corporate governance of European companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already identified stock lending as something we should look at more closely in the context of the future Commission recommendation on shareholders’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree that another important issue here is to clarify the role and the duties of financial intermediaries. In today’s financial world, investors depend heavily on intermediaries to provide them with information and voting services if they want to exercise their voting rights. This point has also been stressed by delegations in the Council. The Commission has already undertaken to examine this question thoroughly in the impact assessment to the future Commission recommendation. I think all the parties involved agree that this issue is too important to address without having examined all available opinions and without having carried out a full assessment of the possible consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">You might ask why we are considering using only a recommendation in order to tackle these problems. The reason is that the practical processes that are relevant in this context are constantly developing, also due to the constantly improving technology. We do not want to set the current situation in stone, but wish to leave enough flexibility for adjustments. The Commission recommendation will give us this flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">My colleague Mr McCreevy therefore confirmed last month, in a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, our intention to address this issue, together with others, in the context of the work on the recommendation. I hope you share our view that this is the right way to render the provisions of the draft directive even more effective in practice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Almunia has already said, this is an extremely important project. It is concerned with deepening the European internal market, and one aspect of this is giving owners the opportunity to exercise their rights across borders in this internal market. The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted this important project unanimously. We have come to an agreement with the Council whereby, if this House follows the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs in plenary, the Council will do likewise, and thus we shall be able to achieve a result here at a single reading pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first crucial issue with which this Directive is concerned is that of the representation of shareholders at general meetings; that is, the exercise of voting rights not by the shareholders themselves but by intermediaries – representatives – or by means of proxy voting.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are widely differing rules for this in the EU, some of them highly restrictive. The compromise reached in the end makes representation possible in principle, but subject to a transparent procedure, and also gives the Member States the opportunity of prohibiting representation by national law in the event of conflicts of interest.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second important area is the issue of the right to ask questions. The problem here is that the traditions and, in particular, related legal consequences, rights of challenge and similar points vary greatly between Member States. The scale ranges from Member States where questions can be asked but do not need to be answered, to Member States where questions have to be answered correctly and, if they are not, resolutions adopted at general meetings can be declared null and void.</p>
      <p sl="de">A compromise has been reached on this that lays down the right of shareholders – owners – to ask questions in principle, but does enable Member States to make sensible adjustments and also limited restrictions to the right to ask questions in accordance with their own legal traditions, without calling this right into question in principle.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Commissioner Almunia mentioned, a number of issues could not be resolved definitively with this Directive. This is partly owing to legal systems. An example is the legal relationship between shareholder and representative. Indeed, this has no place in a Directive concerned with company law, as matters such as this belong in contract law, which is why the Council and Parliament subsequently agreed to deal with it in a separate recommendation, a separate legal act.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same goes for the subject of the languages used. In this regard, the co-rapporteur Mr Klinz from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had made the – undoubtedly constructive – suggestion of providing for similar rules to those in the Transparency Directive. Here, too, however, we later decided – following the negotiations – that, in systematic terms, it would be better to regulate this within the framework of a recommendation than in this specific text. Consequently, this issue, too, will have to be resolved in the separate legal act.</p>
      <p sl="de">All in all, I should say that, from my point of view, we have managed to solve the multitude of problems that existed when we started dealing with this Directive. It is true that they have not all been solved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, there is no question about that – this is normal when one has to reach compromises. Ultimately, however, they have been solved in a way that enabled the solution to obtain unanimous support in both the Council and the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to express the warmest of thanks to my co-rapporteur, Mr Klinz, to the shadow rapporteurs from the two committees concerned – but particularly to Mr Medina from the Committee on Legal Affairs, with whom I enjoyed close cooperation – to the two Chairs, Mr Gargani and Mrs Berès, to the Austrian, Finnish and German Presidencies, which contributed significantly to the success of this project, and last but not least to the European Commission, whose help with overcoming the problems was very useful.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cross-border share ownership is on the increase, but attendance at general meetings across borders remains unsatisfactory. That is what this Directive sets out to change and improve.</p>
      <p sl="de">The objective is welcomed and shared by all parties, and so I had reckoned with relatively simple, short negotiations as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – but reality taught me otherwise. Thanks to the peculiarities of the bodies of company and civil law of the 27 Member States, and also cultural differences – some of them major – the negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council were protracted and difficult and ultimately produced only minimum harmonisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, there has been some very tangible progress, as Mr Lehne has already said. Share blocking is to be abolished, cross-border proxy voting liberalised and electronic means permitted. These measures will undoubtedly make it easier in future for those with cross-border share ownership to cast their vote at general meetings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Agreement has yet to be reached on a solution to some key problems, however, which the Commissioner has also mentioned. I particularly regret the removal from the Directive of the definition of the shareholder and the role of intermediaries in cross-border depository chains. The issues of stock lending, the language to be used and the special position of investment funds have also been left out. These are fields where minimum harmonisation is particularly necessary if we are to really establish a genuine European share culture.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, I am pleased that the Commission intends to address and take up this subject specifically in the form of a recommendation. The provisions agreed give the Member States broad scope for action, and so we shall probably have to live with different rules – some of them substantially so – in the individual Member States for many years to come.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that the approach of minimum harmonisation that has been chosen does not risk diluting the whole project. Only experience over the next few years will show whether attendance at general meetings actually increases perceptibly and thus the main objective of the Directive can be achieved.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would firstly like to say that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is going to vote in favour of the proposal by Mr Lehne, as amended in the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, while I am pleased that Commissioner Almunia is with us, I believe that this would have been a good opportunity to hold a personal exchange of views with Commissioner McCreevy, because, as has been highlighted in previous speeches, there are questions about the limitations of this proposal for a directive.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is a minimal proposal for a directive, about which there are a series of question marks. For example, with regard to the issue of financial intermediaries, the legitimate rights of shareholders and the use of proxy, that is, the right to vote by means of a representative.</p>
      <p sl="es">The text that Mr Almunia has read to us on behalf of Mr McCreevy talks about a future Commission recommendation. The problem with recommendations is that they raise difficulties from the point of view of Community law.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Lehne has said that we are talking about provisions of the Treaties, but at the moment we in the European Parliament are concerned about the over-use of the systems of so-called ‘soft’ law by the Community institutions, which raises questions about the reliability of the Law. I have the feeling that this issue will have to be discussed.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that, at meetings with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner McCreevy will clarify his ideas a little so that we can ascertain what we can do in order to reassure ourselves that progress is going to be made in a particular direction.</p>
      <p sl="es">We Socialists are rather concerned about the protection of the rights of shareholders. We are concerned about the possibility that, in a great European Union market, financial operators will act with total impunity and freedom, and I have the sense that this is an important issue for everybody, for investors and for savers, which should be subject to full consideration and discussion between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will therefore vote in favour, but I would say once again that I hope Mr McCreevy can discuss the methods for making future changes in the legal field with us.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne for all his work on a matter that is so important for the future of European integration and the growth of the single internal market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present, citizens of several Member States of the European Union who hold shares in companies quoted on the stock exchange, and whose registered office is located in another Member State, experience significant difficulties in exercising their voting rights. As the process of European integration gathers momentum and the internal market grows, the amount of cross-border capital investment is increasing, which is a good sign. It suggests that integrated financial markets are becoming established in Europe. This process should be encouraged, which is why the Commission recommendation on the directive deserves our support today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The document under debate contains many important proposals devised to make it easier for shareholders to exercise their rights. I should perhaps mention the need to ensure that sufficient notice is given when convening all general meetings. It is also important to ensure that interested parties have easy access to information announcing meetings and the results of votes taken in them. Providing for proxy voting is another important issue, along with measures to make it easier for intermediaries to act for shareholders. These are the kinds of solutions that will make it possible to restrict certain types of share blocking.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur for his report. There are many essential elements concerning this report which we can all get behind, particularly in protecting the rights of shareholders and making the process transparent. It is nice to hear the transparency directive mentioned — which I worked on before. However, from a legal point of view its treatment is slightly different from the approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where strong opinion found in favour of certain key issues, in particular necessary distinctions required in dealing with intermediaries and stock lending when, in particular, shares were repatriated in order to allow for owners to vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">The timing is vital and we are surprised, therefore, that Amendment 26 to Article 7 does nothing but confuse the situation. What happens to these shares – are they to be deposited? Transferred? Registered? What? There seems to be nothing there which allows for specific requirements. There are no specific requirements or references to them concerning the sale of transferred shares. Might this not lead to certain further confusion?</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also amendments from the ECON Committee which I have to say have been subject to what I deem the ‘recital effect’ by the Committee on Legal Affairs and to the ‘letter effect’ by Commissioner McCreevy, who suggested that later developments on these issues should be expected. Let us be frank. Nobody likes to be told that their amendments are reducible or that they can be ignored. The ECON Committee is an equal player and its remit allows it to be so. I can only say that the process has been unsatisfactory in that regard, which is partly the reason for this debate today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope we can come back to these issues in the ECON Committee with the Commissioner to repair some of these problems mentioned in our ECON opinion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is clear that our political group and particularly the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are pretty critical about the procedure. I will not repeat what others have already said on this, but what I would like to stress here is that if as a parliament we have codecision rights on a dossier, we should take every opportunity to really assess what comes out of informal negotiations with the Council and Commission in a codecision procedure which is likely to go to a first reading agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why we were a little upset that this dossier is already being dealt with in this sitting rather than in March as had been planned. We would then have been able to discuss an oral question with Commissioner McCreevy about ‘one share, one vote’. I hope that we will still have this opportunity and that the Committee on Legal Affairs will also support us in having this further debate with Commissioner McCreevy.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the content, the essential difference between a recommendation and a legislative text is precisely this codecision. A letter from Commissioner McCreevy to Mr Gargani, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, announces that some of the issues we were concerned about will be dealt with in a recommendation. The last line says, ‘You will be informed about this one as a parliament’. This is the exact point we are making. We would like to be co-legislators on that type of issue as well. This is the reason why we are not really happy that some of these issues could not be taken up in the agreement with the Council. Maybe if we had had more time we could have also convinced the Council that this kind of issue, which is of major concern, could have been included in the first reading, second reading or conciliation agreements. These are my comments on what happened today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission’s initiative was what we were looking for, but the way in which the Commission set its objectives needed correction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the work which we began in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and which, following many discussions, culminated in the agreement before us today, was worthwhile on two counts, first and foremost on the definition of the term shareholder, which, in the form proposed by the Commission, was too broad. This led us to embark on a definition of securities law that was very close to the practice in force on the other side of the Atlantic, which does not correspond to our traditional notion of what is a shareholder. I feel that a narrower, tighter definition, such as we are proposing today, is the right way forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point on which we have been led to amend the Commission's proposal is the issue of the process of reattaching voting mandates. On this issue, too, I feel that, thanks to the work undertaken in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with our rapporteur, whom I wish to thank, we were able to emphasise the existence of compulsory instructions in the event of a mandate: an obligation to observe and retain these instructions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To this end, I feel that in addition to the question of cross-border rights for shareholders in this report, the Commission would be better off looking equally closely at what is important in terms of employee share ownership or the stability of shareholders in certain industrial situations regarding which, from a European perspective, we would favour a coherent strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like, if I may, to take this opportunity to ask you again, Commissioner, about the Commission’s position on the Hague Convention. This issue forms an integral part of this debate. Parliament asked you to withdraw the Commission’s signature under the Convention, and the debates in the Council have clearly not moved on very far. I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to talk to Mr McCreevy again and to tell him that this House wants the Commission to rethink its position on this issue and to withdraw the European Union's signature from this Convention.</p>

      <p sl="fr">800 000 small shareholders, still accounting for some 90% of the company’s capital, believed the promises of the tunnel’s designers, of the public authorities, the bankers and the manufacturers and invested some EUR 4.5 billion in the company.</p>
      <p sl="fr">They are now ruined, and will be damaged even further by a ‘rescue’ plan, which consists of selling the company to non-European shareholders at basement rates and reimbursing its creditors, which have already earned EUR 8.5 billion in interest. This plan was drawn up without consulting the shareholders and has been imposed on them by the Paris Tribunal De Commerce (Court of Arbitration in Business Matters). The only choice open to them is to respond or not to a takeover bid, which will keep them forever sidelined when it comes to capital and, by extension, to business decisions, at the very moment when the business is becoming extremely profitable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Fifty years! Almost fifty years during which several European countries have made great efforts in the area of development aid and north-south cooperation. Half a century, with mixed results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why? For several reasons. One reason is the lack of appropriate development strategies on the part of the countries receiving aid. This is why I voted in favour of the report on budgetary aid for developing countries, that is to say, aid directly managed by the government of the benefiting country. In this way, it is that government that will assume responsibility for its own development, following dialogue with the Union and the drafting of a strategy.</p>

The conditions leave no room for doubt: no budgetary support without observing standards of governance and without fighting corruption; no budgetary support without measures aimed at cleaning up the economy. The more points a government scores for good governance, the more aid it receives. This is about creating a virtuous circle.</p>

      <p sl="es">The fact that this illegal fishing cannot be prevented leads to losses and poverty for their coastal populations that depend on fishing for a living and for a secure source of food.</p>

In this regard, I would like to stress once again that one of the virtues of the association agreements in the fisheries sector between the European Union and other countries is that Community deep-sea fishing fleets have accepted the code of conduct for responsible fishing, promoted by the United Nations, and that their presence in those waters also means that other illegal vessels do not act with such impunity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, being in favour of renewing all the fisheries agreements with third countries, since they offer significant mutual benefits for both parties, I have voted in favour of the plan to eradicate illegal fishing, because it poses a serious threat to the biological balance of the oceans, and that represents a great environmental risk that we cannot afford.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The EU has on several occasions declared its willingness to develop and deepen relations with its neighbours. One of the essential prerequisites for improving bilateral relations is to facilitate the legal movement of people. At this point, I should like to point out that the Russian Federation proposed to the EU the bilateral lifting of visa requirements. Following the rejection of that offer, an agreement was reached in complicated negotiations covering short-stay visas for citizens of the Russian Federation and the Community, except for citizens of three of the EU Member States. This is something of a pilot agreement because negotiations are ongoing on a similar agreement with the Balkan countries, Ukraine, Morocco and China. The agreement contains a number of positive points, such as visas to be provided free of charge for holders of diplomatic passports, multiple visas, timeframes for issuing visas and fees for visas.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Naturally, this agreement is a long way short of visa-free relations, and the quick and problem-free issuance of visas free of charge. Some comments made in the debate in this Chamber indicate that there are a number of MEPs with vested interests in the issue. Attempts are being made, on the one hand, to revive the corpse of the European Constitution and, on the other hand, to use the agreement to interfere in Russia's internal affairs. These attempts were mostly repelled and were not included in the visa agreement. We therefore support it in the belief that this is the first step on the road to visa-free relations with one of the EU’s key partners.</p>

      <p sl="en">The GUE/NGL Group welcomes all Agreements that promote bilateral travel arrangements between the EU and the Russian Federation. These facilitate the travelling of Russian citizens to the EU and vice versa. Moreover, such arrangements are considered to be an important step forward, aiming at establishing better communication ties and creating political dialogue on a cultural, economical and political level.</p>
      <p sl="en">However the GUE/NGL Group is very much concerned about the EC-Russia Short-stay Visa Agreement because of its close political link to the EC-Russia readmission agreement, which seriously undermines the protection and rights of refugees and immigrants, as well as their fundamental rights. The GUE/NGL Group is also strongly opposed to Article 11 of the joint declaration to the agreement which defines "biometric identifiers" in diplomatic passports as a priority for ensuring a high level of document security.</p>
      <p sl="en">GUE/NGL is also opposed to the fact that certain provisions of the Agreement apply exclusively to certain categories or groups of people.

      <p sl="cs">The readmission agreement with Russia is one of the important documents through which the Commission is attempting to regulate immigration. It actually forms part of the debate on the issues of democracy, equal rights, minority rights and the protection of cultural identity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The issue goes beyond relations with Russia and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The key issue for EU Member States is mass immigration from Africa, Turkey, countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC), Indochina, China and Latin America.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The agreement with Russia should be a kind of model agreement, on the basis of which the Commission will clarify progress in the European economic area, and at the same time will gauge the extent to which it can interfere in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries. Russia is a large and powerful partner on which the EU is dependent up to a point, and because of this the agreement avoids making criticisms under the heading of ‘respect for the basic rights of the persons involved’. It is only through the issues raised in the explanatory statement from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that we see an attempt to use the readmission agreement to interfere in Russia’s internal affairs.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This trend is so disturbing that there is no way that I can support the agreement. It runs counter to the security and humanitarian aspects of the agreement. The Committee on Foreign Affairs is mostly interested, oddly enough, in ‘the absence of a regulatory framework for implementing the agreement’. I welcome the call for the Commission to help Russian institutions implement the agreement. On the other hand, I object to the obfuscation of the concept of safe third countries.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I share the view that the agreement on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas and the readmission agreement between the European Community and Russia should help strengthen mutual relations and create a joint European area based on shared values and common interests.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should like to remind the House that Russia was the first subject of the so-called joint strategy presented to the European Council in 1999. Even at that time it was clearly stated that Russia should be firmly anchored in Europe and that Russia must not be viewed merely as a threat or as an inferior or troublesome partner. Taking account of both this overview and of current events in Europe and around the world, I cannot accept the idea put forward in the report on the readmission agreement that relations between the EU and Russia are going through a critical phase and that the new partnership and cooperation agreement after 2007 will depend on the perceived human rights situation in Russia. Russia is not a superpower which wages wars and tramples human rights underfoot across every continent. Those who criticise human rights abuses wherever they occur, and not only in Russia, should first ensure that they themselves strictly uphold human rights. The fact that this is not the case is evidenced by the situation of the Russian non-citizens living in the Baltic States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This resolution adopts the Commission’s proposal concerning the Council’s decision, which heaps praise on the Lisbon Strategy and asserts that unemployment has gone down in Europe. The Lisbon Strategy, even in its revamped form, will remain a symbol of shallow populism and inefficiency, given that the Member States subject to the Brussels guidelines are having difficulty in toeing the pro-European line and fail on growth, employment and modernising their social security systems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This reduction in unemployment, according to the Commission’s positive assessment, is a delusion masking the reality of the figures. This is very much a case of a ‘Potemkin Village’, because, in France alone, many poor people and people in insecure employment, not to mention the unemployed on training courses and many members of the active workforce who have been given early retirement, have been skilfully excluded from the statistics.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the procedural amendment proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, wisely calling for Parliament to be given the necessary time to fulfil its consultative role on these social issues, demonstrates our institution’s powerlessness in the face of pro-European absolutism.</p>

      <p sl="el">The Employment Guidelines in the European Union, which were jointly drafted and decided both by the New Democracy government and the previous PASOK government within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, inextricably link employment policy to the core objective of maximising the plutocracy's profits, the necessary prerequisite to which is huge intensification of the exploitation of the working classes.</p>
      <p sl="el">The pronouncements by the ΕU about allegedly reducing unemployment and so forth are aimed at deceiving the workers, given that it itself admits the failure of its policies, finding that the overall rate of employment was 63% in 2003, which is much lower than the agreed objective of 70%, despite the apportionment of unemployment with temporary and flexible forms of employment, which accounted for 60% of new jobs between 2000 and 2005.</p>
      <p sl="el">The future being prepared by the ΕU for the workers on the basis of the axes of its policy is a future of ‘de-employment’ in which, even from preschool age, they will acquire fragmentary, opportunistic skills and training, drift from one form of semi-employment to another, with half or no employment, social, insurance or pension rights, travelling the length and breadth of their country and the EU in search of work, being constantly retrained to the requirements of capital with disposable knowledge, working into old age or until death producing incredible wealth which will be reaped and appropriated by the plutocracy.</p>

Following the uproar caused by the Commission communication on a sustainable European wine industry, and in particular the decision to eradicate 400 000 ha of vineyards, it was necessary for the European Parliament to present its views of future reform of the wine sector in this report.</p>
      <p sl="sk">What is vital, in my opinion, is to preserve the budget of the Community, and not to shift any funds from the first to the second pillar of the common agricultural policy, which is devoted to rural development, as this might lead to resources being lost to the wine industry. On the other hand, it is necessary to support the market position of wine and the wine industry by establishing a realistic advertising, communications and marketing policy based on joint organisation of the market. I firmly believe that the Commission can devise efficient draft legislation only by making proper provision for the proposals from the European Parliament aimed at preserving the leading position worldwide of quality wines produced by the European wine industry, which is still a significant source of employment and prosperity in quite a few European regions, including Slovakia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on reforming the common market organisation for wine, because I believe it contains many positive proposals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As this report was worked on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it was very obvious that the committee was divided into two camps. One comprised of the countries of northern and central Europe, and the other included southern European countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nonetheless, I am sure everyone agrees that action must be taken to balance the situation on the market. I also believe that the possibility of using sugar beet to enrich wine in wine-growing region A must be retained. Failure to do so would amount to discrimination against the countries located in parts of the Union where the climate makes wine growing more difficult. Those regions have never produced surpluses and should be exempt from the ban on certain plantings, which is aimed at limiting production.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, I feel that the resources allocated to the emergency distillation of wine surpluses should be limited. The additional wine alcohol produced in this way distorts the market in ethyl alcohol and is a burden on the Union’s budget.</p>

The European Commission has, in any case, often taken a similar line; for years it has preferred brutal liberalisation and large-scale distribution, at the expense of quality, tradition and the protection of consumers and producers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Just to give an example, I would like to point to Regulation (EC) No 316/2004 which liberalised 17 traditional designations, in reality opening up the market to wine-making piracy.

      <p sl="fr">The European winemaking sector is in a difficult situation, facing fierce competition from wine from the New World. It should be highlighted, however, that the EU remains the biggest producer, the biggest consumer and the biggest exporter of wine in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I strongly object to the Commission’s first proposals, which would place production in the hands of a few major winemaking operations and would lead to a standardisation of wine and to crises in numerous European regions. Permanent grubbing up would lead to the abandonment of production in the areas most cut off and in most difficulty, where there is no alternative form of production, and would serve to speed up the process of desertification.</p>

Rather, they threaten European (quality) winemaking potential, hamper the sustainability of the Community winemaking sector and damage the stability of winemakers.</p>

This will in turn serve to exacerbate the desertification of vast areas, as has already happened in Portugal, and to place the wine and alcohol sector into the hands of a few major producers and large companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are measures aimed at reducing the EU’s vineyards, which would affect primarily the least developed regions, family holdings and farmers on low incomes, but they will have little impact on the rise in imports and the declining role of winemaking in the EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">The constant increase in wine production and quality in the so-called ‘New World’ countries (South Africa, Australia and South America, where vines are, by contrast, being planted), the increasing presence of these wines on the European market and the fact that worldwide demand for wine is on the increase make the idea of grubbing-up all the more incomprehensible. Europe needs to be able to compete with its competitors on equal terms.</p>
      <p sl="it">With a view to optimising European wine production and wine-making, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that underlines the need to maintain the ban in Europe on using the new wine-making practices for ageing wine (such as the use of oak shavings instead of the traditional period spent in the barrel).</p>

That alone is not enough, however. The key issue is combating radicalism. After all, it is not our freedom, economic development, modernity or the mere existence of Western culture that feeds terrorism; it is radicalism. We must not let the ‘white man’s burden’ obscure reality. Radicalism must be combated by promoting women’s rights, by increasing trade and economic relations, by developing the economy and by fostering democracy; in a nutshell, by promoting the presence around us of more liberal societies. It is also necessary, at the same time, to invest immediately in security, including efficient intelligence services that are equipped to face the new realities, and to be prepared to use military means when this is useful, necessary and legitimate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Conservatives strongly support robust counter-terrorism measures and the protection of genuine human rights, which should not be abused, as a first line of defence for terrorists. The report contains some useful elements, calling for closer cooperation between EU Member States and external allies like the US, Japan and Australia, an investigation into charities linked to money laundering and terrorist financing, and universal ratification of the 16 UN instruments on combating terrorism. However, too much of the report is devoted to extending the role and competences of the EU. It not only refers to the draft European constitution but encourages the EU to implement more treaty provisions relating to the European Security and Defence Policy, which is seriously flawed. We oppose proposals to remove the national veto in areas of police and judicial cooperation, a violation of national sovereignty that would leave the UK even less able to control its borders and defend its integrity. The report makes only one mention of NATO, seemingly as an afterthought. For all these reasons Conservatives abstained on this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Europe’s economy is experiencing a period of growth. This has led to lower unemployment, improved public finances and a reduction in the average budget deficit. It should be emphasised that labour productivity has risen, and this has made us more competitive. I believe it is appropriate to point out to the House that these positive economic trends emerged following the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Low economic development was a feature of all of the 10 new countries which joined the Union in May 2004. A more detailed study reveals that economic growth was significantly higher in the countries which liberalised their labour market and opened it up to the flow of workers from the new countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It may therefore confidently be stated that enlargement of the Union benefited both the old Fifteen and the new Ten. It is to be hoped that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will prove a further positive stimulus to the Union’s economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of the report before us is to square the circle – to tackle the economic and social problems faced by the Union whilst developing the existing economic policies and instruments that lie at the root of those problems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report does acknowledge that over the past six years, since the introduction of the euro and the Lisbon Strategy, there has been weak economic growth, stagnation and even recession in some Member States, including Portugal. It recognises that economic recovery cannot be taken for granted, that unemployment remains high (17 million in the EU) and that poverty has gone up 2 percentage points. It also considers it unacceptable that there are almost 80 million poor people in the EU. Moreover, it acknowledges weak internal demand and the need for greater investment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It contradicts itself, however, when it says that the euro and the internal market have been crucial victories for European progress, and promotes monetary policy (wage moderation), the deregulation of the labour market (flexicurity) and the Stability and Growth Pact. Reading between the lines, we can see its true purpose – to create a climate that is most favourable to entrepreneurial activity. The current economic and social policy guidelines pursued by the EU have been championed again and the contradictions of the social democrats and their role in liberal capitalism have been laid bare.</p>

      <p sl="sv">This report contains no analysis of what may need to be harmonised at EU level. It is based on assumptions the truth of which needs to be demonstrated. The objective is all but total control of economic policy at EU level. It is asserted without a shred of evidence that EMU has strengthened the European economy. Experience suggests, rather, that the single currency has been downright damaging in relation to stabilising the economy and has had few positive structural effects.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The rapporteur demands more money from the Community budget for the Lisbon Strategy. That is absurd. What is required is that the Member States in fact behave in accordance with what they properly understand to be their own interests. There is no reason for trying to get other countries to fund them out of common budget resources.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The report shows no understanding at all of the value of the Member States having so far avoided control from above and therefore being able to look for new directions in economic policy. At the same time, the rapporteur continually points out that certain countries succeed much better than others in various areas. The fact that he can indicate these differences and draw conclusions about what is obviously best practice is due to the fact that we have not implemented the standardisation and extreme control from the top for which he appeals.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Higher oil prices, which have hit almost USD 80 per barrel, appear to be a structural phenomenon that is here to stay. Unlike the oil crises of the 1970s, which were caused by a breakdown in supplies, the current ‘crisis’ has arisen, on the one hand, from increased demand on the part of developing countries such as China and India, and of the biggest consumer in the world, the United States, and, on the other, from predictions that this ‘finite’ resource will be in short supply in the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Living with higher oil prices worsens recession and balance of payments difficulties, results in higher production costs, inflation and interest rates, penalises families on low incomes and causes wars over control of the oil supply, as in Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If technological solutions can contribute towards increasing energy efficiency, and towards finding new forms of fuel and energy, it is vital that we change the capitalist mode of production, which causes waste and inefficiency. The answer lies in reducing GDP energy intensity, in promoting high-quality public rail transport and in promoting production for local markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Whilst the rapporteur has put forward some welcome proposals, we cannot accept the creation of an internal market for energy and the liberalisation that goes with that.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The June List believes that rising energy prices are best adjusted to at national level. We are therefore sceptical about this opinion-soliciting resolution from the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="sv">For example, paragraph 20 of the draft report regrets the lack of an energy regulator in the EU. Bureaucratisation and control from the top are, as always, the only way proposed by Parliament. We believe that the Member States should exercise the regulatory function themselves as long as there is no question of cross-border risks of the type associated with nuclear power. If such risks do exist, the regulatory body should, however, be the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency. The EU countries should agree on certain energy targets. How these are achieved should be left up to the individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Otherwise, the report contains both helpful and unhelpful wordings.

      <p sl="pt">Although the report stresses the impact of oil price increase on the transport sector, which is responsible for 56% of total oil consumption, it is a great pity that it makes no reference to other sectors, such as fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fuel prices have hit the fisheries sector particularly badly. Its operating margins and economic viability have been significantly affected, thus exacerbating the socio-economic crisis in the sector. Between 2004 and 2006 alone, the price of fuel went up by around 100%, and in some parts of the sector fuel accounts for some 50% of total operating costs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fishermen have seen their incomes go down, which is particularly serious as the sector is mainly concentrated in regions with fragile economies. Various studies warn of the risk of thousands of fishing businesses and thousands of jobs disappearing on account of fuel price rises.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Urgent, extraordinary measures must therefore be taken to support the sector, for example the creation of a guarantee fund, with Community participation, in order to stabilise fuel prices. Until such time as that fund is put in place, the fishing businesses affected must be granted some form of temporary compensation.</p>

      <p sl="en">The high cost of oil has significant adverse effects on businesses and families in Scotland, where there is still substantial dependence upon road transportation of goods and passengers, due to a lack of realistic alternatives in large areas of rural Scotland, and due to the distances involved in transporting goods to mainland European markets.</p>

      <p sl="mt">The economic impact of the increase in oil prices is considerably greater in situations such as that of Malta, which is a country wholly dependent on oil as its energy source.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This is a problem that has never been addressed with the urgency it deserves, despite the fact that a country of Malta’s size lends itself more easily to the development of creative alternatives. If our limited space does not allow us to build large alternative energy plants, then fiscal incentives must be made available to those businesses and families that want to invest in cleaner energy technology.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Due to a lack of planning in the area of oil purchasing, Maltese and Gozitan families and businesses now have to pay a surcharge on their electricity bills, which currently stands at 45%.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This surcharge on services that are so essential is proving to be a financial burden on families, especially those in the lower income bracket, and is giving rise to extra costs for companies - a development that in turn is putting pressure on the cost of living. Worse, this continuous fluctuation in prices makes it difficult for individuals to plan ahead, and this leads to uncertainty.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is no good thing that the world at large should have accepted for so long China’s conception of Tibet as an integral part of itself. The Tibetans embody their own culture in inhospitable living conditions, isolated and high up in the mountains. For a long time, China has been unable to resist the temptation to consider that region as a fall-back that can absorb sections of its own very large population.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is a problem not only for the people of Tibet, but also for those of the neighbouring and more readily accessible region of Xinjiang, home to the Uighurs, who are related to the Turkic-speaking peoples, such as the Kazaks, Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks. They fear becoming minorities in their own countries and losing everything that is dear to them. Moreover, we should certainly not idealise the traditional living conditions of Tibetans and Uighurs. Although sweeping changes are called for, these changes should not be imposed from outside or, what is more, serve outside interests.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Since China is the world’s most populated country and an up-and-coming economic power, it is extremely unlikely that Tibet will be given the opportunity to develop into an independent state. This makes it all the more important that, 50 years after the major conflict, there should be a reconciliation in which, within China, the Tibetans are allowed to retain the most valuable traits of their individuality and they no longer run the risk of becoming the victim of state violence. These days, the progress ideology that has dominated China for nearly 60 years is mainly focused on economic growth. Although this has drawbacks, it does offer more scope for tolerance and recognition of diversity than was the case for a long time. A dialogue or cultural individuality and self-governance within China should pay off. My group is in favour of anything that can contribute to this dialogue and to peaceful solutions.</p>

      <p sl="it">As the European Parliament, in the past we have made the proposal that a special representative be appointed to deal with the issue of Tibet, but we know that the proposal has so far not been implemented. In my view, this would be a useful and tangible contribution. There are also other instruments, such as a declaration by the Presidency of the European Union.</p>

This is only the case, however, if the Chinese Government, too, stops deliberately raising certain issues as stumbling blocks. For example, it is unacceptable to put the spotlight on the history issue; that is, to ask whether or not Tibet was ever part of China. This is completely the wrong question to ask. Instead we must look to the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to keep repeating that the Dalai Lama and the Tibetans themselves are striving for autonomy – and not just on paper – allowing them cultural and religious freedom and access to education. They are not questioning the ‘one China’ policy. This must be emphasised time and again, even if the solicitations from the Chinese Embassy that many of my fellow Members have no doubt received in recent days tell a quite different story. I can tell you that we know how things stand. We need dialogue, and we want this dialogue. Europe must support it – I fully agree with the previous speaker on this. Europe must bring this dialogue into much sharper focus and also conduct it at official level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the dialogue between the Government of China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is to be warmly welcomed and should continue to receive our approval and support. Only through forward-looking dialogue will pragmatic solutions be found that will meet the aspirations of the Tibetan people and fully respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Let us always keep in mind that the ‘one China’ policy is a long-standing EU position.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our support is undeniable, but we should also ensure that this support becomes practical. Such practical support should be offered in the context of the new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and China. Personally, I do not support the idea of a special representative for Tibet because we already have enough means in our hands to facilitate such a dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">China has an enormously positive role to play in world affairs. Just one example: China made a vital contribution to the success of the six-party talks on North Korea just yesterday. We can use this as an example and as a lesson. If China can make a positive contribution through structured dialogue to regional peace and stability, then we can also engage China in a dialogue which will help to create a climate of confidence that will allow for a pragmatic solution to the Tibet issue.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on 26 October 2006 the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the shooting of unarmed women and children in the Nangpa-la pass. We also called for those responsible for this crime to be punished. The incident caused an outcry the world over, but to no avail, as the situation in the region remains unchanged. It is true that no reports of further brutal murders have reached us recently, but this does not mean that the situation has improved.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems to me that little has changed in this age-old conflict during the three months that have elapsed since our last debate. We must be consistent, however, and bear the rights of the 6 million people affected by the problems in the region uppermost in our minds. This is a region where human rights are still constantly violated, even in the 21st century. In my view, this problem should be a priority for the new President of the European Parliament and therefore, ladies and gentlemen, for us all.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, what good are bilateral talks if they do not produce any tangible results? Do they mask an inability to act, or do they at least contribute to confidence-building? Parliament is rightly calling for the resumption of the dialogue, last conducted one year ago, between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government. Items on the agenda should include the elimination of reprisals, an end to human rights violations, and tangible measures to guarantee the Tibetan population cultural and religious autonomy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The dialogue was launched in September 2002. China has been blocking it for 12 months. The grounds are always the same: preconditions are to be met; the Dalai Lama is not interested in improving relations, and is striving for Tibetan independence. This is simply not true. For years, His Holiness has been interested not in an independent state, but in Tibetan autonomy. There are good examples of this kind of legal status even in the EU. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stands by four positions, as do almost all other groupings in this House. Firstly, an EU Special Representative for Tibet must be appointed. It is insufficient that this issue be relegated to the fringe of EU–China dialogue. Secondly, we want the Commission to make Tibet an integral part of the EU–China Partnership and Cooperation Framework Agreement. We ask that the Commission inform Parliament of progress and retrogression. Thirdly, the Council should include in its annual report information on current developments with regard to the China–Tibet dialogue. Fourthly, the EU should draw up joint strategies with its partners in the world, particularly the USA.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is my fervent hope that the representatives of the People’s Republic of China understand the desire of the international community – as just expressed by my fellow Members – for China to resume this dialogue with the Tibetans at long last. After all, China’s representatives are most preoccupied with good press in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I believe that today's debates on the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama's representatives are particularly important for a number of reasons, but above all, because on 17 January this year negotiations officially started in Beijing toward a new agreement on the basics of partnership and cooperation between the European Union and China. More than once we have expressed support for the commitment of the Government of the PRC and His Holiness the Dalai Lama to resolve the issue of Tibet by means of dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I think the European Parliament, which in the past has adopted more than one resolution on Tibet, on the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China and likewise on dialogue between the PRC and the Dalai Lama's representatives, must urge the European Council, the Commission and European Union member countries to actively support the intensifying of this dialogue and to seek a result. While no tangible results have yet been obtained in the resolution of these basic questions, Parliament should – in consultation with both parties – evaluate what further role the EU can play in seeking to facilitate a solution of the Tibet issue by means of negotiation, and it should appoint a special European Union envoy to Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I support the position of the resolution we are considering that the Senior Commissioner and the Council's Secretary-General be encouraged to include information about progress on the dialogue between the PRC and representatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2007 and also in later years in the Annual Report to Parliament on General International and Security Policy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I think the country currently presiding over the Council – Germany – could initiate and accept a declaration that would show how the European Union might assist in achieving a peaceful resolution of the Tibet question through negotiation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Thomas Mann and other colleagues who initiated the resolution being considered today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the question of Tibet’s status is raised in the European Parliament several times a year. So far, however, the resolutions we have adopted have not led to any tangible results. The same is unfortunately also true of the consultations that have been taking place between the Tibetans and the Chinese Government since 2002.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The problem of Tibet remains unresolved. In the meantime, over 1 200 000 of the six million Tibetans have lost their lives under the Chinese occupation that began in 1951. Every year, some 3 000 inhabitants of Tibet flee their country. These are mainly children and young people, who can only obtain a Tibetan education abroad. The Tibetan people are discriminated against in every area of social life, from education through to social care, work, living conditions and religion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must act in solidarity and exert pressure on the Chinese Government, so that the dialogue is resumed as soon as possible and the status of Tibet regulated. The European Commission should raise the matter of discussions with the Dalai Lama during negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between China and the Union. For its part, the Council should define the Union’s role in resolving the Tibet issue, as the outcome of the negotiations between China and Tibet should be reflected in the Council’s annual report to Parliament on the implementation of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the problem of Tibet has been with us for many years and, as has already been mentioned, this House has dealt with different aspects relating to this problem many times in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">In essence, the core issue of dispute between the people of Tibet and China has been the wish of the Tibetans for self-determination, as opposed to the Chinese Government’s fear of a possible domino effect leading to the break-up of China.</p>
      <p sl="de">In fact, such a problem has been the commonest cause of disputes worldwide. However, history has shown that by far the best and most effective way to solve such problems is through peaceful and open negotiations with a prerequisite determination on the part of all concerned to find a lasting solution. The alternative way – that of endless confrontation and bloodshed – usually leads nowhere and is, in most cases, to the detriment of both sides.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this in mind, we would warmly welcome a commitment by both the Government of China, in particular, and the Dalai Lama to resolve the Tibet question through a process of dialogue, and wholeheartedly hope that such a process, if brought about, will lead to a successful resolution of the Tibetan problem.</p>

      <p sl="es">Despite the fact that since 2002 there have been five rounds of dialogue between the Government of the People's Republic of China and representatives of the Dalai Lama, it is abundantly clear that there are fundamental differences standing in the way of reaching a definitive agreement that clarifies the situation of Tibet in a way that is satisfactory to all of the parties, while at the same time being fair and proper, particularly for the people of Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, I am one of those who believe that the responsibility of each of the two parties for the fact that an agreement has not been reached cannot be compared.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Dalai Lama, as the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, has demonstrated his desire for dialogue and agreement on more than one occasion, and he has even given up his demand for complete independence in favour of a genuine autonomy that guarantees respect for the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious identity of Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, I believe that it is the Chinese Government that should show greater signs of willingness and at least accept a resumption of dialogue with a view to reaching a good final agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would therefore urge the European Commission, the Council and the Member States to take every possible opportunity to support a new round of dialogue between China and Tibet. In particular, as others have said, it is essential that we take advantage of the negotiations of a framework agreement on European Union-China cooperation, which began on 17 January, to express the Community’s commitment to dialogue and a fair and lasting solution to the issue of Tibet.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is often the case that different standards are applied to China, where human rights are concerned, than to countries where lucrative contracts are unlikely to materialise. It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral .</p>
      <p sl="nl">When reading the relevant resolutions, which reflect not only the positions of the different groups in connection with this dialogue, but also the stance of official Europe, I, as a Fleming, do have some reservations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Politicians who, yesterday and the day before that, while discussing the Fava report, brandished international law and insisted on human rights – which they were right to do – are now suddenly talking about the need to respect China’s sovereignty, whilst not breathing a word about the illegal occupation and subsequent annexation of Tibet, about the mass human rights violations, the ever increasing exclusion of the Tibetans from their local government, or the Namdrang Rangdrik programme, launched in 2005, whereby Tibetans are forced to demolish their houses and subsequently rebuild them according to strict official guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The sanctimonious line is that a mutually acceptable solution must be found for Tibet’s future. To say that is to make victim and executioner equal partners in dialogue. It became once again evident on whose side the EU is when in November 2005, the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, was received with much pomp and circumstance across Europe, yet it had, in fact, been he who perpetrated serious human rights violations when he was Secretary of Tibet’s Communist Party between December 1988 and March 1992.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Tibet issue once again demonstrates that European rhetoric all too often amounts to nothing but moral wrapping paper and that in reality, only economic interests matter. We must continue to have the courage to denounce the cowardice and sanctimoniousness of this Europe, of this mercantile Europe that chooses to side with the oppressors to the detriment of innocent peoples.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for your very strong commitment to human rights. I trust the honourable Members have noticed the same strong focus on fundamental human rights and universal values in the recent Commission communication and in the Council conclusions on China. This reflects the fact that it is and will remain an important priority for the European Union with regard to our overall relations with that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">We share the concern expressed in the joint resolution regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and, in particular, the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. This issue has been regularly addressed by the European Union in the framework of bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, such as our bilateral summits and senior officials’ meetings. Former European Parliament President, Mr Borrell, also raised the matter when he officially visited China last year.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the recent shooting mentioned by Mr Czarnecki, I would like to inform you that this matter was formally taken up by the European Union during the last session of the EU-China Dialogue on human rights held in Beijing in October 2006 and via the subsequent follow-up démarche in December 2006. On both occasions, the EU urged the Chinese authorities to undertake a thorough investigation of this incident and refuted the Chinese claim that the shooting had been done in self-defence. We will follow this serious matter closely. I agree with Mr Matsakis that bloodshed leads nowhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has regularly kept this Chamber informed regarding its overall policy vis-à-vis Tibet and will continue to do so. As Commissioner Fischer Boel underlined in this Chamber in October 2006, the EU has consistently taken the view that establishing a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Tibet, which will hopefully lead to the recognition of a genuine autonomy of the Tibetan region. We have therefore followed very closely and welcomed the five rounds of talks which have taken place up to now between the Special Envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government. In this respect, EU officials have regular contacts with the two Special Envoys, the last being in November 2006. Even in this Chamber there are differing opinions on the question of the appointment of a special EU envoy. We have our doubts about the value of such an appointment, because such an envoy would probably be prevented from having a real impact on the ground or from playing a significant role in this dialogue. We need the two sides to continue and deepen the dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree with the honourable Members that this dialogue should be regular and substantive, and that the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence. We take note that the Tibetan side is ready for a rapid resumption of the dialogue and hope that the Chinese side is willing to do the same. The European Union will spare no efforts in stressing the importance of this dialogue to both parties on all possible occasions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to express my gratitude for your attention and focus on this matter and your support, especially now via this resolution, because such support is helpful in the process.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first I wish to express my thanks for this motion for a joint resolution. I believe that it is sound, impartial and relevant. Constructive solutions need to be found for this age-old issue of Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The motion for a resolution is geared towards finding a solution to the Tibet question which is compatible with China’s right to self-determination and which respects the rights of the people of Tibet, and this, I think, is the right approach. We need a constructive, peaceful process that recognises that Tibetan nationals have a right to their own culture and religion. As citizens of Europe and of the world, we have to ensure that people’s fundamental rights can be implemented around the world. In this respect it is to be hoped that people’s cultural and religious rights will not be restricted in Tibet either. We would hope that proper dialogue can be established between Tibet and China, leading to a solution that is satisfactory to both sides.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I hope that we will find practical solutions which also show respect for China’s regional inviolability but which at the same time fulfil the wishes of the Tibetan people. I do not know if this is too much to hope for, but we in the European Union must work hard to establish such a peaceful coexistence.</p>

This is something of a sensation. It is one that gives us pleasure, and I would be very happy if, during the trilogue, we could bring pressure to bear to ensure that this becomes something of a dependable tradition, that is to say, that the presence of the Council – Mr Nooke is here as an observer today – becomes a fixture in these Thursday afternoon human rights debates in future.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, although this resolution on the situation of refugees from and in Iraq is a very sound one, it is silent on the central issue, namely the reasons why there are refugees in and from Iraq. The primary reason is the occupation of Iraq by troops from the US, the UK and other EU Member States, and, above all, the nature of that occupation. If you pursue a policy of occupation of this nature, you should not be surprised when it generates refugees.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite Germany's restrictive asylum policy, people from Iraq now form the largest group of asylum-seekers in that country. According to figures from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are 1.7 million refugees within Iraq and a further 2 million in neighbouring countries. These people are fleeing because Iraq is in a state of war. The Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins University have presented a study, published in the New York Times and the Washington Post , which estimated the number of Iraqis over and above the normal mortality rate who died as a result of the invasion and its consequences between March 2003 and July 2006 to be 650 000. Of these, the estimates count 600 000 people who have died as a direct result of violence and 50 000 who have died as a result of disease and other causes. The study goes on to say that, after the end of the invasion, 31% of the victims were believed to have been killed by coalition troops or air raids. According to the Johns Hopkins University, the risk of dying a violent death is 58 times higher than before the invasion.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I want to say to this House is that these figures show that the occupation of Iraq is wrong and must finally be brought to an end. The collective support of this war by a number of EU Member States, including Germany, must cease. If that happened, there would not, in fact, be as many people who have to flee as there are at present, as has been quite properly stated in the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my thanks to colleagues for initiating this important debate. I cannot agree with the point made by the previous speaker, which was not discussed when we framed this report. May I say that what we can do in the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament is something different.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are huge numbers of Iraqi refugees in Jordan, in Syria and in other neighbouring states, yet in almost every one of those countries these refugees are not allowed to work. Their children are prevented from going to school. Their parents and children are not allowed access to healthcare. They are in a desperate plight and there is no state support for them, as there would be were they in European Union Member States as refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">Inside the country there are huge numbers of IDPs – internally displaced people – equally without work, without food, far from their homes. They have been displaced mainly through religious and ethnic cleansing, one of the most miserable of wars to fight internally, as we know so well from our past history in Europe. The Shia are fleeing the Sunni, the Sunni are fleeing the Shia and many others are fleeing because of the various different insurgencies that are going on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would suggest, therefore, that the European Commission, which has worked mightily on this problem, should declare Iraq an emergency. I would ask the Council of Ministers, which has also worked incredibly hard with the Government of Iraq, to discuss this with the Commission and with other G8 donors, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iraq has in a sense been put on one side. People have been unclear as to what to do, but today, now, the Iraqi people are back in the sort of crisis they were in under the prolonged dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, under whom many more fled and under whom many more were killed. But here we are. They need our help.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strongly request that the Commission and the Council of Ministers declare Iraq to be in an emergency state, to mobilise donor funding and spend it accordingly: housing inside, aid outside. There is a lot that we can do, but we have to look at the situation differently.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this unhappy debate takes note of the oh-so-predictable humanitarian disaster which has afflicted the people of Iraq since the coalition invaded illegally. It also demonstrates the double standards of our own Member State governments, particularly, I am afraid, my own in London, rather than Edinburgh, where I would rather it were.</p>
      <p sl="en">Chancellor Gordon Brown was asked how much funding was to be allocated to the military action and his answer was ‘as much as it takes’. I am afraid the financial allocation to the humanitarian support measures is shameful.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we have heard, the United Nations estimates that 1.8 million people have been forcibly displaced within Iraq and 2 million have fled that unhappy country. That is more than the population of a number of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister Blair worries about international terrorism – he talks about it often enough. Well he might! The direct result of his policies has created the best possible recruiting ground al-Qa’ida could ever have asked for.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, what to do? As we, of course, go through airport security this evening flying home from this place, let us think that that is Prime Minister Blair’s legacy to Europe and to global politics. We, as we have heard, can do better: by sticking to our principles and by digging deep into our budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Red Cross efforts are severely underfunded. The countries neighbouring Iraq are in desperate straits and in dire need of support. This motion has a number of points in it which I commend to the House.</p>
      <p sl="en">We did not create this disaster, but we are in a position to ameliorate its effects. By doing so, I hope we can lead by example where so many of our Member State governments have so comprehensively failed.</p>

I should like to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr António Guterres, for drawing attention to this disaster, which took place on 7 February.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should also like to give a special word of commendation to the Swedish authorities for their exceptional European-level response to the human disaster. I should particularly like to commend the Egyptian authorities, which is the non-bordering country that has done by far the most to welcome these refugees, and I should like to make a heartfelt plea to the Egyptian authorities not to prevent these refugees from arriving or to suspend the conditions for hosting them when they arrive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Most of all, however, I wish to call on the Commission and the Council – as Mr Posselt, who is here today, so aptly reminded us – to open their eyes, to go to Iraq and to see what is happening there. A disaster of this nature would never be possible unless it were organised from somewhere, as was the case previously in Rwanda and in the Balkans. We can no longer turn a blind eye; we must go to Iraq and understand what is happening. In this connection, I should like to say that I am proud that I was there recently. I have drawn up a report and invite all my fellow Members to have a look at it on the Internet.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I do not wish to speak about politics. Mr Casaca has just recalled the political context of the invasion of Iraq and its consequences. He may well be right.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would prefer to focus on issues that may not be as important for journalists or for politicians like ourselves, but which are probably far more important for those who are currently going through hard times in Iraq, namely the refugees. In my view, the underlying reasons for events in the world of politics are of secondary importance. What is really important is what we can actually do. I am firmly convinced that we are currently being perceived as helpless by the rest of the world. I am also firmly convinced that the European Union is not in a position to provide real help to these people. This is even truer of the United States, and is really tragic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There seem to be two aspects to the situation in Iraq. There are the victims of attacks, in the form of the hundreds and thousands of people we see on our television screens. They make up the news we are bombarded with. We hear very little, however, about the other aspect of the situation in Iraq, namely the tens of thousands of refugees. The European Union must certainly not appear helpless in this regard, and I agree with the previous speakers who referred to initiatives by the Scandinavian countries and to Egypt’s role. All that is true.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must make a clear and determined statement to the effect that we are interested not only in that first aspect, namely the victims of the attacks we see on television. We must let it be known that, as Europeans, as European politicians, we are equally concerned about refugees. The refugee problem is probably one of the greatest embarrassments for those who started this war and for those who are pursuing it, even if they are acting with the best of intentions. A reaction is therefore necessary, and that is what the European Parliament is currently engaged in. I am grateful for the wise words contributed by other speakers today.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, behind the Iraqi refugee problem is a set of circumstances the like of which it is predicted will only become more common in various future conflicts. The situation has reached a state of civil war. The Christian minority in particular have become a scapegoat, and many Christians have been killed. Iraqi security forces have been unable to protect Christians, no matter what the Government’s attitude is.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For example, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon have taken it upon themselves to place refugees temporarily. In these countries, the United Nations refugee agency has not been able to confer refugee status on incoming Iraqis during the current conflict because the situation does not meet the criteria of the Geneva Convention. The present Government in Iraq is not persecuting Christians, but the problem is that sects inside the country are, and the Government cannot do anything about it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">International agreements therefore do not grant refugee status to Iraqi Christians, although there is no doubt that they are in need of temporary protection. To protect the asylum seekers, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not made a negative decision with regard to them either, since otherwise the host country could return them to Iraq, a situation which the UNHCR wants to avoid. Accordingly, it is vitally important that the international community responds to the agency’s appeal for more international support. To aid the refugees, international assistance is required so that Iraq’s neighbouring countries, which are struggling with huge numbers of refugees, will not close their borders to Iraqis. The latest news that the United States of America is accepting more refugees is a step in the right direction, and is vital, because earlier the United States had been shirking its responsibilities in this area. We need more news like this. Of the EU countries, Sweden deserves special mention.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Iraqi refugee situation is absolutely desperate. There is a shortage of everything: food, medicines, health care and fuel. I heard of actual examples of this when the human rights organisation I head met a group of Iraqi Christian refugees in Turkey last autumn.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Crucial, however, to the assistance of Iraqis is to establish comprehensive reforms to promote justice and the law throughout Iraq. Similarly, the Iraqi Government must do all it can to bring those guilty of crimes and breaches of human rights to justice. This is essential if the unrest and violence against minorities is to cease.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I endorse this resolution, not least because, at least in some of its subsidiary clauses, it vigorously champions the rights of the persecuted and imperilled Christians of Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must bear in mind that the Christian communities in today’s Iraq are probably some of the most ancient in the world. They have survived for 1 300 years as a minority in a Muslim-dominated part of the world, something for which those Muslims also deserve credit, yet today, in a time of massive Western presence in Iraq, they are under threat. This has to do with the fact that Iraq was put together as an artificial state after the First World War, that that state is now on the point of breaking up and that its constituent parts are attempting to make themselves homogenous units through a process of nationalistic self-discovery which, of course, poses a particular threat to the minorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one laudable exception, and that is the Kurdish sector. This is something worth highlighting. I do, however, call on Shias and Sunnis to follow in the great tolerant tradition of their forefathers and once again afford the Christian communities in Iraq the protection that they have enjoyed in that part of the world for over a thousand years. I call, above all, on the Commission to go into bat strongly for the rights of Christians, because who else will do this if we do not?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on 8 January, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued an urgent call for funding to the donor states for a new USD 60 million aid programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">The object is to help hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the conflict in Iraq, irrespective of their faith. Such massive movements of fleeing people are the results of a war that was begun against the will of the international community, yet it is the international community that now has to bear, and pay for, the terrible consequences.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are currently witnessing the largest long-term exodus since the displacement of the Palestinians in 1948. One in eight Iraqis is a refugee. In 2006 alone, half a million Iraqis fled their country. Every month, another 50 000 join them. There may now be 1.7 million deracinated Iraqis in Iraq. By the end of 2007, the UNHCR estimates this number could be 2.3 million. The longer the conflict goes on, the worse will be the plight of these displaced persons and the communities that help them and that want to help them.</p>
      <p sl="de">We call on the Member States and the Commission to support the UNHCR, politically and financially, in its work protecting the refugees, irrespective of their faith.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figures given are more or less in agreement: we are now approaching 4 million refugees, around half of whom are ‘external’ and the other half ‘internal’ within Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="it">To all intents and purposes this is a humanitarian catastrophe almost without precedent, and for this reason the opportunity offered by the Geneva Conference on 17 April 2007 should not be wasted: the European Union must prepare itself and arrive in force, with a political presence at the highest levels, having already decided on an appropriate amount of funds to put on the table. If this is not done, we risk total failure. This is a point on which we all need to be united, regardless of the political reasons for the conflict: thus the greatest possible unity is needed to resolve an issue which is liable to explode in our faces, with disastrous consequences.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to its causes, I believe that perhaps – obviously this is not the subject of our resolution; I am just mentioning it to the representatives of the Council and the Commission – it would be useful to take into consideration the possibility, faced with the daily carnage in Iraq, of referring the matter to the International Criminal Court, since these are crimes against humanity, committed systematically and on a daily basis. Perhaps this could also be helpful with regard to the causes of this humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I too want to focus on the Assyrian Christians who are now seeking refuge mainly in Syria and Jordan. Iraq’s Christian communities are amongst the world’s most ancient, speaking Aramaic, the language of Christ. They suffered terribly during the 1915 Armenian genocide, and then again under the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy for cooperating with the British during the First World War. Then they suffered again during Saddam Hussein’s days when he had the war with the Kurds. Today there are only about 6 000 to 8 000 who remain, mainly living in the Nineveh Plain.</p>
      <p sl="en">As many as 60 000 Assyrian Christians, or perhaps even more, have fled since the beginning of the insurgency that followed the US-led invasion in 2003. Their exodus was accelerated in August 2004 after the start of the terrorist bombing campaign against Christian churches by Islamists, who accused them of collaborating with the allies solely by virtue of their practising the Christian faith.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last April the European Parliament voted for the Assyrians to be allowed to establish, on the basis of Section 5 of the Iraqi Constitution, a federal region where they can practise their own unique way of life, free and safe from outside interference. I call again on this House, on the Commission and on the Human Rights Special Observer from the German Presidency, for this solution to be considered as a possibility.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Every day we hear about bloody explosions in Iraq, and the victim count is growing steadily. We do not get enough information though about another tragedy – the painful fate of becoming a refugee has affected 4 million Iraqis. Almost one in six of the inhabitants of that country has been forced to leave his or her home, the number of refugees is increasing, and their situation is terrible. The United Nations Organisation is trying to help, but unsuccessfully, because the international community has still not grasped the seriousness of the situation. The initiative of Sweden, which has agreed to grant refugee status to 9 000 Iraqis, is to be commended. Not many EU countries so far, especially the new ones, have had the resolve to follow this example. However, particular responsibility falls on the United States, which, willy-nilly, created the current situation, in which Iraq is wading ever deeper into the quagmire of a nation beset by divisive internal and external conflicts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the emergence of Saddam Hussein in the post-colonial troubled era in Iraq brought a rule of intimidation, persecution and murder of citizens. The illegal military invasion and occupation of Iraq undertaken in 2003 by Mr Bush and his British bulldog, Mr Blair, have brought an unprecedented calamity to the people of Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Bush-Blair duo has succeeded in accomplishing in the space of three years what the likes of Saddam Hussein did not succeed in doing for thirty years, i.e. to bring the country completely to its knees, with hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians killed, with utter lawlessness, with comprehensive destruction of the country’s infrastructure and with millions of internal and external refugees. The USA and Britain could together spend over one thousand billion dollars a year supporting their war machines in Iraq, which largely caused the problem in the first place, but now expect the international community to deal with the enormous humanitarian problem of the Iraq refugees. Instead of the USA and Britain taking care of the Iraqi refugees and all the necessary costs involved, they expect neighbouring and European countries to do so. Fair enough: we must not deviate from the rule that those who cause a catastrophe very seldom pay for it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the German Presidency, and warmly welcoming the presence of its representative at today’s debate. I am delighted the German Ombudsman is with us today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to UN data, almost two million people have left Iraq in recent years because of the danger to their lives, the chaos and the difficult economic conditions. We are witnessing a major tragedy of refugees fleeing from Iraq to neighbouring countries. There are a million of them in Syria, some 750 000 in Jordan, over 100 000 in Egypt, 40 000 in Lebanon and many more scattered throughout other countries. Those Palestinians inside Iraq are in a particularly difficult position. In its statement on 2 February 2007, Human Rights Watch called on Syria to immediately open its borders to the Palestinians who are currently in danger in Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The UN is calling for a contribution of USD 60 million to a fund to help refugees from Iraq. The world cannot remain indifferent to their fate. Today’s decision by the United States to grant asylum in the United States to 7 000 Iraqis next year is a step in the right direction, as is the decision by the United States to contribute USD 18 million to the programme to assist refugees from Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These are still only drops in the ocean of need, however. The European Union must play a leading role in the forthcoming conference to be held in Geneva on 17 April 2007. It must provide financial support to alleviate the plight of the refugees and help resolve this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to express my gratitude to the authors of this resolution and to the groups and individuals who have presented their opinions. There was a strong focus on the eminent need for solidarity with the people in great need. The Commission is also extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the scale of human suffering caused by the ongoing violence in that country, the high level of displacement inside and outside Iraq and the impact this is having on the whole region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the past few months the Commission has kept monitoring the situation, keeping in close contact with other key international players, notably with the Red Cross and the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you have mentioned, we have the same figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: 1.8 million people are now internally displaced and 2 million Iraqis have already fled to neighbouring countries. As Mr Smith said, that is nearly 4 million people.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, an exact assessment of the needs inside Iraq has so far been made impossible by the difficulties of gaining access to the affected populations as a result of the security situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The conference the United Nations is holding in Geneva in April, which has also been mentioned here, is expected to provide more clarity regarding the situation of internal and external displacements, the impact and the needs. The Commission will take an active part in that Conference. I am certain that Mr Cappato expressed an important invitation be united there with the Council and the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, based on the information received from partner international humanitarian agencies, the Commission, through its Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), has decided to allocate EUR 10.2 million for humanitarian aid to the victims of the Iraqi crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">As announced this morning by my colleague Mr Michel, an initial funding package of EUR 6.2 million, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, will be proposed for meeting the humanitarian needs of refugees who have fled to countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. The aid will consist of basic healthcare and education, as well as targeted distributions of food and essential household items. Protection activities are also envisaged, in particular support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ refugee registration system, which is important in identifying the most vulnerable groups and assessing their specific needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another initial funding package of EUR 4 million is in the process of being drawn up for people suffering inside Iraq, based on a careful assessment of priority needs and aid delivery arrangements in what is a highly volatile security environment, as you can imagine.</p>
      <p sl="en">Humanitarian aid will be provided impartially and without discrimination, with a focus on those most at risk. The Commission will consider further funding decisions when new needs emerge or when access to groups requiring help, and who are currently out of reach, becomes possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will also continue monitoring the situation closely and to raise specific matters through its regular discussions with third countries and the Government of Iraq, including the Ministry of Displacement and Migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the situation deteriorates further in the coming months, the Commission will examine the situation in the light of the criteria of the Temporary Protection Directive, in order to decide whether to submit to the Council a request to activate the temporary protection mechanism for the Iraqi asylum seekers. This may offer them immediate protection while, at the same time, providing financial support for their actual reception as well as making arrangements for an eventual redistribution of asylum seekers amongst Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will also explore, in close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the possibility for a coordinated effort by EU Member States to resettle refugees from the region. Such a resettlement effort could target particularly vulnerable categories of people, such as women-at-risk and unaccompanied minors.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, when in 1958, France agreed to self-determination for its West African colonies, Guinea was the only one to decide in favour of immediate and complete independence. In the 11 other colonially governed areas, the elite chose, often disregarding the will of their own people, to perpetuate close administrative, military and economic ties with France. Guinea, on the other hand, followed the example of the former British colony Ghana, which had gained independence one year earlier, and which wanted to develop an African model of socialism with strong participation of the own population. The leaders Sekou Touré and Kwame Nkrumah inspired many Africans in their battle for a better future, in which colonialism and poverty were set to be replaced by equality and development. Unfortunately, a military coup in both countries stopped this development in its tracks. In Guinea, Conté has wielded dictatorial power since 1984. Most parties did not take part in the elections that were organised under his control, and the official opposition that was represented in parliament was forced to leave it. The trade union confederations CNTG and USTG are now the main force in the fight for democracy. The presidential security force, led by the dictator’s son, responded to their protest rally on 22 January by killing 59 people and wounding 150 others. The dictator increasingly treats the country as his own private property. Like many other countries that are run by dictators, Guinea is also becoming the victim of the fight over natural resources among factions that want to get their hands on the revenues from them. In this case, the resources in question are gold, iron and bauxite. This resolution stands up for the demands of the democratic opposition, and it enjoys my group’s support.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and the representative of the Council for being here today. The time has come for the Union to take action, as the situation in Guinea is sliding downhill.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Guinea has for too long been deliberately kept in a state of underdevelopment by the dictatorial regime and is becoming mired in a tragic deadlock for lack of transparency and democracy. The people of Guinea have had enough of poverty, destitution and social injustice; they have not enjoyed the benefits of Guinea’s riches – the country has an abundance of natural resources – which are monopolised and mismanaged by the President and his cronies, who are as guilty as he is. President Conté, who has been in power since 1984, is ill, and is clinging to life as he is clinging to power. If he survives, no one will begrudge him his health. If, on the other hand, he remains in power and re-establishes a state of emergency. We will neither understand nor accept this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After decades of undiluted power, one has no choice but to condemn such an attitude when wisdom, or a modicum of compassion for his people, would surely have led the President to prepare for the smooth transfer of power to his successor and for the transition to a genuinely democratic regime. Instead of that, a state of siege has been declared, the right to assembly and freedom of movement have been curtailed, and the military have violently broken up peaceful demonstrations and killed people. This is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have no choice but to condemn this brutality, this lack of respect for the most basic human rights of the people of Guinea and the shameful behaviour of a leader who is at the end of his reign but whose capacity for causing suffering is sadly not at an end. We must demand that a committee of inquiry be set up to look into the events in Guinea in order to ascertain the full extent of the repression and the level of the hierarchy at which decisions have been taken and by whom.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, will the EU demand political dialogue, as laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement? We must keep a very close eye on the situation, because, if it were to continue to worsen, not only would the people of Guinea suffer but so too could the whole of that region of Africa, as the deepening internal conflict would spread to neighbouring countries. The past is sadly all too full of such examples.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, you might be surprised to know that Guinea has a long history of association with Europe. It first became known to Europeans during the Portuguese discoveries that started the slave trade in the 15th century.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 1890, present-day Guinea was created as a French colony and remained so until 1958. From 1958 until 1984 the country was governed by a dictator, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who was supported by the Soviet Union. Following Touré’s death in 1984, a new totalitarian regime took over, headed by another dictator, Lansana Conté, who some claim was supported largely by the West. Conté’s rule has certainly been better than Touré’s, but is still very far from being democratic. The heavy-handed approach to political opponents and the events in February which led to the killing of 23 demonstrators is proof of that. Guinea represents a country used and sometimes abused by Europe in the past and is now struggling to survive in extreme poverty and political instability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Guinea’s mineral wealth makes it, potentially at least, one of Africa’s richest countries. We, as Europeans, have a duty to assist its people – honestly and effectively this time – in finding and following the road to true democracy, freedom, justice and prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in Guinea, since 17 January, an old senile dictator has been massacring his people with complete impunity in order to protect his regime, his corrupt friends and his waning power.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Guinea is in complete decline. Despite its status as the leading exporter of bauxite and despite its deposits of gold, diamonds and iron, its people are among the poorest in the world. Its wealth is consumed by corruption, and bad governance does the rest. Repression beats down on a people who no longer accept it. President Conté’s only response to the January strikes was to have the crowd fired on, to imprison the trade unionists, then, having pretended to negotiate on 27 January, to go back on his commitment to appoint a consensus prime minister and to declare a state of emergency. There have now been more than one hundred deaths, and the massacre goes on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe cannot remain silent and do nothing. We cannot wait for Guinea to descend into chaos with unforeseeable consequences for the region. Europe has a responsibility to fulfil.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We call on the Commission to implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, applicable in the event of violation of human rights and democratic principles. We must now support the people of Guinea and demand that the authorities end the massacres immediately, release those arrested during the demonstrations, restore civil liberties, lift the state of siege, open negotiations with the trade unions and civil society, and, in cooperation with the opposition parties, appoint a consensus prime minister and government.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I believe that the European Union must call for elections to be convened under international supervision, with missions sent by the European Union and the United Nations. That is what is currently being done in Mauritania, involving our fellow Member, Mrs Isler Béguin, to whom I pay tribute in this House, and it was what was done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with results that have been extremely effective and significant.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we must indeed support the proposal for an independent committee of inquiry, led by the United Nations, into the violence of recent months. After twenty-three years of dictatorship, enough is enough; the European people must stand alongside the people of Guinea in their fight for freedom and dignity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as has been said already, Guinea’s fishing, farming and raw material resources make it, potentially, a very prosperous country. The fact that, despite this, the country is languishing in miserable poverty is a result of the terrible mismanagement, the dictatorship and the abysmal administration by the state that have obtained there for decades and I am most grateful to Mr Matsakis for having pointed out that Sékou Touré, to whom Mr Meijer referred, was one of worst dictators ever to rule over it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today too, unfortunately, the prevailing state of affairs is anything but acceptable, for which reason we must call on the current transitional president – for he cannot be any more than this – to use the short period that remains to him to bring about an ordered transition to democracy and the rule of law. He can only do this, however, if he does not name a puppet as prime minister, as he now has, but only if he truly commits to the demands of the trade unions and the democracy movement and constitutes a broad-based transitional government, including the forces of opposition, which then does nothing other than set about creating public order and preparing free elections so that the past terror and dictatorship can finally give place to democracy and prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, like many other African countries, Guinea is rich in mineral resources but at the same time is extremely poor. A large proportion of its people live in abject poverty. This was the reason for the strikes and demonstrations that took place in 2005 and also at the start of this year, protesting against the corrupt rule of Lasana Conté who has been in power for 23 years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The strikes are an expression of discontent regarding inflation, unemployment, energy and water shortages and the high price of basic goods. In recent times, the strikes have also led to the interruption of the export of aluminium ore, which is Guinea’s most precious asset. Tremendous losses were incurred, reaching a level of USD one million a day. The leaders of the January strike and the trade unions did suspend the protest, however, following the signing of an agreement demanding a change of Prime Minister. The promises contained in the agreement between the trade unions, the Parliament of Guinea and its Supreme Court were not kept, and once again a member of the ruling party was appointed Prime Minister. This does not bode well in terms of improving the situation, as demanded by the protestors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Events in Guinea are similar to those that took place in my home country some time ago. In Guinea, the current regime is also firing on fellow citizens fighting for change, better living conditions and respect for fundamental human rights. We demand respect for the principles of democracy and reforms in a country whose inhabitants wish to live in dignity, supported by their own natural wealth which is currently being exploited by rich companies and siphoned off by corruption. Thousands of Guineans are dying of hunger and poverty. Over a hundred were killed during the demonstration. These are the victims of a fledgling democracy and of the struggle for human rights. They are also a stain on the consciences of those who value aluminium ore, bauxite, gold and diamonds more than human lives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, not only has the country had a very difficult history and legacy, but it faces a very difficult current situation. However, together we can help to bring more hope to Guinea.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is fully aware of the situation in that country. In a press release of 22 January, the European Commission condemned the violent interventions by the security forces and called for restraint and civic responsibility during these demonstrations. Commissioner Michel regretted the loss of human lives and encouraged the different stakeholders to pursue a constructive dialogue in order to implement the necessary political reforms important for that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The German Presidency, on behalf of the Union, issued a declaration on 9 February regretting the loss of life during the demonstrations and asking the Government of Guinea for an explanation of the circumstances of those deaths and of the judicial steps being taken against those responsible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inquiry commission appointed in Guinea is led by public prosecutors, but victims and relatives are invited to submit their cases either to the courts, which have limited means, or to the police, an institution heavily involved in the repression. Given this situation, the Guinean Bar has refused to participate in the inquiry commission and has called for an international commission instead. The Bar also wishes to present a case to the International Criminal Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s delegation in Conakry and Member States’ embassies have repeatedly stressed to the Government of Guinea the need to carry out a full inquiry into the events. This was also stressed by Commissioner Michel to Foreign Minister Condé. The delegation and other diplomats have also stressed to the new Prime Minister that the behaviour of security forces observed during the previous strike should simply stop.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ninth European Development Fund cooperation strategy with Guinea, signed on 21 December 2006, includes governance as a focal factor, as a priority. Actions foreseen are aimed at promoting effectiveness and transparency in public management, reinforcing the rule of law and promoting a democratic society.</p>
      <p sl="en">A reinforced political dialogue with the country is ongoing as a follow-up to the Article 96 (Cotonou Agreement) consultations, which ended in April 2005. The Commission has stressed to the Guinean authorities that the new situation would be taken into account in this context.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to thank you for the resolution, and express the firm belief that the European Union should support the country in seeking a better future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have indeed agreed to withdraw our Amendment 1 in order to maintain a consensus and a unanimity among the groups that, I am delighted to say, will, I believe, strengthen the resolution. With the agreement of the various groups, we have instead submitted an oral amendment to be added at the end of recital D and which I will read to you in English, since that is the language to be used as reference and in which the oral amendment was negotiated. It will specify that intervention is taking place by mercenaries from Liberia and Sierra Leone, currently used by the authorities, but that officially there is not yet absolute proof of such intervention, even if all observers on the ground have begun to note it. In order to refer to the situation while remaining rigorous, we will state the following:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I believe that our fellow Member, Mr Matsakis, wished to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment in order to make it still more precise, and I should like to say straight away that I support the wording that he will now propose to us, so that we may all vote unanimously in favour of the same text.</p>
