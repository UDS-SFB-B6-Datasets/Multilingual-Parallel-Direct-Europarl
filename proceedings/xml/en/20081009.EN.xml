      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0347/2008) by Carlos Carnero González, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on insertion in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure of a new Rule 202a on the use by Parliament of the symbols of the Union (2007/2240(REG)).</p>

    <intervention id="4-008" speaker_id="1973" name="Carlos CARNERO GONZÁLEZ" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Spain" birth_date="24-11-1961" birth_place="Madrid" p_group="Socialist Group in the European Parliament" m_state="ES">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the decision my report proposes to this Chamber is, above all, political, in the strictest sense of the word. The formal decision we are about to adopt, though clearly relevant, is the very least of it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Indeed, we are about to amend our Rules of Procedure to make official what is already a reality, what the different Union institutions have been doing for years. I would like to remind Members of that.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are proposing that this House should use the Union flag in all its meeting places and on the most formal occasions, for example, at constituent sittings or when receiving heads of state. We also propose that the anthem should be played on these occasions, that the motto ‘United in Diversity’ should be included in all our written documents and that Europe Day should be celebrated.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, although you were in favour of the idea, we are not suggesting that the euro should be used as a symbol. However, in our opinion, the euro is a great tool, a wonderful instrument that is undoubtedly helping us to deal with the international financial crisis. Where would we be without the euro? We would be back in this torturous situation of competitive devaluation that would have brought our real economy to its knees in the face of international financial speculation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The most important aspect of my report is the political message to citizens. This message is very clear: the symbols of the Union are alive and well in the institution that represents, more directly than any other, the 500 million inhabitants of our 27 Member States. This means that the constitutional process that was launched in 2002 with the European Convention lives on in spite of frequent and sizeable obstacles and setbacks.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Convention, of which I had the honour of being a member, along with other distinguished Members here today, had no doubts about including the symbols of the EU in the Union’s primary law for the first time. It thus happily brought to an end a curious situation whereby the most important body of law did not recognise what the public had long accepted: the symbols.</p>
      <p sl="es">The decision in this respect was unanimous and no one challenged it during the ratification process; on the contrary, it was one of the provisions most welcomed by Europe’s supporters. I have to say that it came as a huge surprise, therefore, when the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Lisbon Treaty decided to remove all mention of European symbols from this document.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fact is that, through our decision today, we can undo this error. Of course, we are not amending primary law, but we can do our part and move a step closer to formalising Union symbols within the institutional framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">Symbols express a shared goal and shared values. In Europe’s case, it is the desire to build a Union of and for all citizens who want unity, freedom, democracy, justice, equality and solidarity, which are European values that we also consider to be universal.</p>
      <p sl="es">Symbols also allow us to establish what we are and who we want to be in relation to the rest of the world, which recognises us by them. Who, for instance, has not felt proud to represent the Union when wearing the election observer’s waistcoat?</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, symbols help us to remember where we came from, that day when our story of unity, growth and freedom began to be written.</p>
      <p sl="es">What the President of Parliament said a few days ago in Madrid about young people and history has much to do with symbols. We must remind young people where we came from, who we are and where we are going. Symbols get this message across quickly and clearly. These symbols unite, not divide, us. This is not only a great virtue, but, more than anything, a huge advantage.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the wonderful writer Aldous Huxley said that the most important thing is not experience, but what you do with that experience. The same applies to symbols. The flag is not intended to be an icon, but to be used in our everyday lives to strengthen the unity for which we are known.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I went to Kiev recently and the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry building could hardly be seen as it had been adorned with a three-storey-high European flag. If this symbol can be given so much respect and honour outside the European Union I am sure that here too the European Union can treat the symbols with respect. I would like to correct my colleague, who has prepared an excellent report, on this point. The rule on the symbols of the European Union is at present part of the acquis communautaire , of European legislation: the flag with twelve stars and a blue background, the anthem based on the Ode to Joy , the long-standing meetings of the heads of State and Government, and even the headquarters of the European Parliament, Strasbourg, and of course we hold our sessions in Strasbourg. And at this moment, so to speak, there is no regulation vacuum since, at this moment, rules do exist for the symbols of the European Union, whether they are in the Lisbon Treaty or not.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, an important aim of this report is to regulate how our own institution, the European Parliament, does honour to our standard. It is my conviction that the sense of identity, of where we belong, is very important. We often talk about how our citizens do not understand our complicated Europe. The symbols are one approach, helping them to feel closer to the European Union. Many, many people are fond of these symbols, honour and respect them, and I am sure that it is for us too, here in Parliament, as committed Europeans, a point of major importance to bring in a rule on how we use the symbols of the European Union in our own institution. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, why is it so very important that we should make such an effort and hold this debate, especially now, on the subject of the symbols of the European Union? I believe that there are two reasons. Firstly, we as the European Parliament must show in the way we habitually go about our business that the EU is about more than just legal texts. Let me remind you that, as the rapporteur has said, the symbols originate from the Constitutional Treaty. An attempt was made to institutionalise them, but it is very significant that today we are continuing this effort to keep them alive. Why? Because they happen to show that Europe is not built on flawed legal texts, which are necessary but are difficult for the various nations to understand. They happen to symbolise something else, and how appropriate that fine Greek verb is here: a political project, an idea of Europe. As such, I think it must be kept alive, especially today.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second reason lies in what the symbols conceal - the symbols behind the symbols: in other words, the idea of the EU’s common action based on its values. That is what the symbols are: a common action based on values that we need now more than ever.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thus if we say that the crisis we are all experiencing – and I am referring not only to the economic crisis, but also to Europe’s present institutional and moral crisis – is a symbol of these difficult times, I think the EU’s response must be united action. This means that we could potentially all move forward together.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe there could not be a more apt and at the same time more bitter example than that of Iceland today. This country does not belong to the EU, but it is so buffeted by the economic storm that its people are wondering whether they should indeed be part of this ‘Europe of ideas’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the symbols of the European Union are a celebration of the unity that we have achieved and that we hope to strengthen. Symbols such as the EU flag, the anthem and the motto are already widely used at official events and within all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European flag and anthem, with which we all are so familiar today, were first adopted at the 1985 Milan European Council. By then the flag had already been in existence for 30 years. The flag is intended to represent perfection, complementarity and solidarity and to symbolise Europe’s unity. The motto ‘unified in diversity’ is the most recent of the symbols. It originates from an initiative by the European Parliament and can now be seen as a definition of the European project.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the plenary yesterday, Ingrid Betancourt of Latin America and France said that she dreams of a Latin America that could cooperate and be as united as the European Union. It is clear that our symbols serve as an identity and an indication to the rest of the world that we have accomplished great things together.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although I believe in this unity and hope that it continues, I have been disappointed that on many occasions we have not been unanimous. For example, last week the European Union President, Mr Sarkozy, invited only four of the Member States to discuss the financial crisis. It is very interesting that the President of the European Union does not pay attention to the solidarity and unity of the European Union. This action – like all actions of this kind – only serves to divide rather than to unite us. It is ironic that we are so proud of our unity and solidarity, but at the same time the President of the Union seems to pick favourites with regard to the most important current issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that by using the flag, anthem and motto more often we will all be reminded of the values that are vital to the existence of the European Union but, at the same time, we must remember that how we behave is most important of all.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as the rapporteur stated, this debate is entirely political in nature and is taking place in a very specific political context. I agree with previous speakers that Europe is currently experiencing a crisis of values and that values are Europe’s lifeblood. Imposing symbols in violation of legislation currently in force in Europe is no substitute for these values. The symbols concerned were rejected at the Intergovernmental Conference that confirmed the Lisbon Treaty. Nonetheless, Parliament is today endeavouring to impose them. In so doing, Parliament is acting in defiance of clear principles according to which measures to be directly implemented and binding on all Member States may only be imposed through a treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Such a method of imposing measures intended to be binding is unacceptable. It violates the fundamental principle upon which the European Union is based, and which involves unconditional compliance with international law and agreements. It amounts to side-stepping the provision rejected in the European Treaty and bringing in measures aimed at establishing via the back door a pseudo-state called Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I fully support the parliamentary initiative on the flag and the anthem. European unity needs these symbols because they bring Europe closer to the people and create an identity, and so they need to be officially recognised. Against this background, I see our decision today as a small but significant step to bring us back, as soon as possible, to normality.</p>
      <p sl="de">The removal of the anthem and the flag from the Treaty – the background to which I of course am fully aware of – is and remains an essentially barbaric act against European unity, for which those who called for this step ultimately bear responsibility. The fact is that we have played into the hands of the Ganleys, Klauses and Haiders: their nationalist slogans about a European ‘superstate’, which were targeted against European integration, have thus gained a veneer of credibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, that is just one side of the coin. There is another issue which I would like raise and which causes me no less concern. The citizens of the European Union do not want or need a furore about flags and anthems in Brussels. What they want is a social and democratic Europe, a European Union which offers them effective protection from the negative repercussions of globalisation. They want a clear answer as to what, or whom, the Union is protecting, the people or the markets? They want serious action to be taken against wage, social and tax dumping and an end, once and for all, to the galloping casino capitalism promoted by financial jugglers. For that, we need a political European Union.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I wonder if there is anyone in this Chamber who still remembers when the Constitution was changed to the Treaty of Lisbon after its rejection in the Netherlands and France. The symbols of the EU were removed, as it was thought that EU citizens were particularly sceptical about the Constitution’s objective of turning the EU into a polity. Now, the European Parliament – which of course is the only EU body for which citizens can vote – is in the process of reintroducing them. This most closely resembles a parody of democracy; one executed by institutions with no respect for those they are there for. The EU is there for citizens; citizens are not there for the EU. For this reason, it is improper to first remove something on the grounds of wanting to fulfil citizens’ wishes, only to reintroduce it a few months later.</p>
      <p sl="da">I must say with regard to this matter that I am quite simply ashamed to sit in the European Parliament. We cannot allow ourselves to become notorious for duping citizens in this way. I would call on everyone who has even a modicum of respect for the voters who elected them, to vote against this proposal today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this Parliament wants these symbols for one reason only – to inflate its ego and attach the trappings of statehood to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have a much better anthem and flag, thank you very much, and I am not about to trade them for the tawdry baubles of Eurofederalism. Ode to Joy , which we are going to purloin, may be a very nice tune, but so is Jingle Bells , and like Jingle Bells it heralds a fantasy, the fantasy that the EU is good for you. But unlike Jingle Bells , it will damage your national sovereignty and the right to control your own destiny. More like ‘code to destroy’ than Ode to Joy !</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the flag, which we have stolen from the Council of Europe, even its proponents do not know what it means. We have as many explanations in the AFCO Committee as to what the stars signify as there are stars on the flag.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal to me exposes the insatiable fanaticism of Europhiles. The ink was not dry on the Lisbon Treaty, which deliberately excluded these symbols, before there was an insistence that Parliament give them official status nonetheless.</p>
      <p sl="en">My constituents do not want an EU flag and an EU anthem. They want the right to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the Lisbon Treaty, thank you very much!</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to mention a compatriot of yours, who, during the French Revolution, was upbraided in the street by a sans-culotte, who said: ‘Why are you not carrying the Tricolore , the symbol of the revolution?’. That compatriot of yours replied that there was no need to show on the outside what one felt in his heart.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am more one of those who, no doubt out of modesty, like a good Spaniard, do not externalise their feelings. However, this does not mean that I do not feel moved when I see the European flag hanging from Ljubljana Town Hall or when, at a meeting with our colleague Pierre Lequiller in Yvelines, I heard the European anthem follow the Marseillaise , or when, yesterday, I read in a newspaper that the winner of the Prince of Asturias Prize, the Bulgarian Tzvetan Todorov, had said that ‘united in diversity’ was what European meant today. That is our motto.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am not one of those with a narrow, restrictive mentality or a beleaguered outlook on life, who think that the European flag is in competition with the national flag or that the European anthem aims to replace their national anthem. That, Mr President, is simply ridiculous.</p>
      <p sl="es">Symbols show that we belong to a community; they do not, in any way, represent an attempt to eradicate our individual native countries. They indicate added value, that we share something with other Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe that the initiative taken by Mr Carnero, whom I congratulate, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is the right one. It is an initiative that, at a time when we are ‘stitching together the two Europes’, to use the wonderful expression of our dearly remembered colleague Bronisław Geremek, shows our fellow Europeans that we have the same values. These values are also expressed outwardly, including, but not exclusively, through symbols.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will therefore vote in favour of this proposal to amend the Rules of Procedure, and I look forward to feeling moved, like everybody else, when I next hear the ‘Ode to Joy’ in this Chamber.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Symbols are to sentiment what allegories are to thought. As colourful as it is, this quotation by the philosopher Alain is nevertheless a clear illustration of what these symbols represent for the European Union today. Listening to the Beethoven symphony or celebrating Europe together on 9 May are precisely the elements we are going to use from now on to ensure that Europe stays alive. They are a concrete expression of the values on which the Union is built, markers that gradually become implanted in the memories of the 500 million Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By inserting this Rule in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, the work by our colleague Carlos Carnero González, whom I congratulate, is sending out a political message from Parliament to the citizens based on these values, as proven by the opposition of the Eurosceptics. No politics without symbols! Giving Europe an identity through an anthem, a flag and a motto gives the citizens living and working in Europe an opportunity to see themselves as part of a single entity united in diversity. Displaying these symbols at all levels and in all institutional areas will ensure that there is a constant reminder of the values that inspire Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would nevertheless like to stress today that Europe is experiencing a serious crisis of confidence and that we need to go even beyond these symbolic elements and envisage and rebuild together a strong sense of belonging.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, symbols such as a flag, an anthem, a common currency and holidays are intrinsic features of statehood. This was the very reason why it was decided not to adopt them during negotiations on the Lisbon Treaty. It is duplicitous to maintain that a decision on reinstating them may be taken internally by one of the European institutions. The European Parliament is a legislative body. It must not send out a signal that it is acceptable to find ways to circumvent previous intergovernmental agreements. Parliament must act as the guardian of democracy and the rule of law. If the European Parliament attempts to resurrect previously rejected symbols, it will become an anachronism. One can readily understand that every institution should wish to use specific symbols. In this case, however, it must be understood that a broader political dimension is involved, as the rapporteur pointed out. The move should therefore be opposed.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, as has already been said, the common symbols – the anthem, the flag, the motto – were removed from the Constitutional Treaty when it was changed to the Treaty of Lisbon. Some proponents of the Treaty of Lisbon even claimed this demonstrated that we were attentive to popular reluctance. In some countries the removal of the quasi-constitutional symbols was actually used to argue that there was no reason to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. For example, the Danish Government stated in a document addressed to the Danish people that the Treaty of Lisbon, and I quote, ‘will be purged of symbolic provisions on the EU anthem, motto and flag’.</p>
      <p sl="da">‘Will be purged of’! We should ask at this point what difference this has made in reality. The answer is ‘none’. In its reply to my enquiry, the Commission itself wrote that the fact that the symbols are not mentioned in the Treaty does not alter their status in any way. ‘Does not alter their status in any way’! And now Parliament is to go one step further. Perhaps someone believes that more intensive use of the symbols will arouse enthusiasm about the EU. Perhaps someone believes that the symbols can mask a lack of benefits for the people. I personally do not. Many citizens would just see it as a further example of the EU elite doing exactly as it pleases. This would send out completely the wrong signal, and I do not think that we should adopt this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I wonder what is really the point of this report and the amendment to the Rules of Procedure that is the purpose of the report. According to the explanatory statement, the fact that they are not included in the Treaty of Lisbon does not prevent the institutions from continuing to use them, so why do they have to be enshrined in the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The context in which we should place this debate is that of the European Constitution and the referenda that have invalidated the Constitution. The symbols were deliberately not included in the Treaty because the Dutch, for example, want nothing to do with a European superstate and with the outward symbols of a European superstate. In the meantime the Netherlands has ratified the Treaty of Lisbon. What are we going to do now? Now we are going to enshrine the European symbols in our Rules of Procedure anyway, through the back door.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This amendment to the Rules of Procedure is unnecessary. It is in fact a gratuitous provocation and it is sticking two fingers up at the Dutch voters and, by extension, all European voters who want nothing to do with a European superstate. Well done, ladies and gentlemen!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Yesterday, here in plenary, the European anthem could have formed a backdrop to Ingrid Betancourt’s tears. The anthem would have culminated in a call for the collective sharing of memories and desires. Every human project needs a symbolic dimension, from the strength of the words with which we govern the people of Europe to the rituals of political representation that seat us on the left and on the right, in the dialectic of parliamentary debate. There can be no history without symbols.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We need words, a flag, an anthem or a motto. The universal project of Europe cannot be forged in the collective imagination without the chemistry of symbols, because symbols depict not only the world that we have, but also the world that we want to have. They link the deepest reason and emotion within us. Their value comes from the identity process that they trigger. How can the great project of Europe, based on the transcendental value of human dignity, open towards the world, leading the way in terms of rights, manage without a symbolic dimension? European thought has left us with a long record on the meaning of symbols. Politics cannot ignore this, because politics carries with it all the dimensions of the human being in terms of what is also ideal and sublime.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am somewhat surprised at the storm in a teacup that this change to our Rules of Procedure has provoked in some quarters. We know that the Member States decided some time ago not to elevate the European flag and anthem to Treaty status. They decided not to give them such an elevated status but to leave them with their current status.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is their current status? They are simply recognised by the institutions. The European Council did so as long ago as 1985. By the way, Mrs Thatcher was a member of the European Council then. I see some of her admirers are now repudiating her decision. I must say that I myself had some hesitation about adopting a symbol chosen by Mrs Thatcher as the flag of the European Union. However, in the spirit of all-party compromise and consensus, I am willing to accept it.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the status the flag and anthem were given – recognition by the institutions. There is, however, an anomaly. We, the European Parliament, have never actually recognised them in our Rules. It is quite logical that we tidy up this anomaly and put a reference to the flag in our Rules of Procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">How people can make such a fuss about such an obvious thing to do – about such a normal procedure, which respects the decisions of the Member States not to elevate it to Treaty status – I do not know. But then the ways of working of the Eurosceptics – not least in my own country – have always been a bit of a mystery. When you see that this flag has been around for many years, if you saw the European supporters at the Ryder Cup, when Europe played America at golf just a couple of months ago – where people, who probably included Conservative Eurosceptics, were waving the European flag – it really does look a little ridiculous when they now make such a fuss about this reasonable change to our Rules of Procedure.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, as all the previous speakers have said, the symbols of the European Union have existed for many years. What are we in the European Parliament aiming for by amending the Rules? We wish to emphasise what is called the proper use of symbols, as is done in all organisations.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, there have been unjustified reactions from both Member States and citizens. These are reactions from Member States that think that adopting and promoting the symbols of the EU will lead to the creation of a super-state. For heaven’s sake, will symbols really create the super-state that some Members have talked about?</p>
      <p sl="el">Some say that the national morale of peoples and states will be affected. If the national morale of anyone is so low that it can be eclipsed by a symbol of unity of all states, then I pity what some call ‘national pride’. Such arguments have been heard in this House.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is another question. If some citizens and Member States react so badly to these symbols, how can they continue to be members of this EU when they cannot even bear to look at its symbols? This is a contradiction.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Parliament is right to proceed as usual today with the formal adoption of these symbols. It is sending out a message: the EU must advance united under its symbols in order to become complete and reach a point where it can play its part. Its role is to promote principles and values throughout the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we frequently hear the opinion that symbols are a waste of time and that the European Union should not concern itself with such irrelevant questions. Rather, this argument goes, the European Union’s job is to focus on bread-and-butter issues like employment or trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach is completely mistaken and wholly misunderstands what symbols are about. If you look carefully at how institutions work, then it will rapidly become clear that every institution maintains a set of symbols. These symbols carry a message that people will recognise and act as a shorthand version of that institution. Without institutions, democratic politics cannot exist.</p>
      <p sl="en">So symbols are a necessary part of democracy that the EU regards as being central to its identity. Besides, if symbols were as marginal as their opponents say, then why bother to oppose them? The European Parliament, as the pivotal democratic body of the European Union, has every reason to promote the symbols of Europe as a means of connecting itself with the voters of Europe. Those who are against the symbols of Europe are basically questioning European democracy itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">One could further argue that this is too fluid and crisis-ridden a time to be thinking of the symbols of Europe, and thus that it is not the right moment for Parliament to spend time on symbols. Maybe so, but timing is something that always can and will be debated. In the long run, it will not matter whether the symbols of Parliament and of the European Union are debated now or at some later date. So I give my full support to this important and cogent report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our federalist friends should not try and recruit Mrs Thatcher to their cause. She would be appalled at the developments that have taken place in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have heard that symbols are important, yet we are constantly reassured that the European Union has no ambition to become a state despite every resolution and piece of legislation through this Parliament taking us further in that direction. Of course, the outstanding example of this was the Constitution. This was rejected and then re-emerged as the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to try and sell the Treaty of Lisbon, national negotiators decided that parts of the Constitution that could be interpreted as impinging on statehood, such as the flag and the hymn, should be removed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, British Government ministers used as a selling point when they were trying to sell the Treaty of Lisbon to our people that it was somehow different to the Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">My constituents in the East of England do not want a Constitution, they do not want the Treaty of Lisbon and they certainly do not want a state called Europe. I think it is an affront to them to try and introduce, or give official character to, these symbols.</p>

The flag is raised on all premises of the Parliament and on the occasion of official events. By introducing regulations concerning the use by the European Parliament of the European Union symbols in the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, the Parliament is sending a strong political signal.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Parliament celebrates Europe Day on 9 May.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking all those who spoke during this debate, although it is clear that I openly disagree with some of them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Symbols do not represent only states. At this stage of our development, symbols do not embody confrontation, combat or battles; they are a means of conveying ideas and of uniting people around values. This is what our flag, our anthem, our motto and Europe Day represent.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Intergovernmental Conference was forced by some to remove symbols from the Treaty, against the will of the vast majority. This vast majority preferred to forge ahead with the essentials of the Constitution rather than get caught up in the traps set by those challenging not only the symbols but also the need to progress further in political union. For that reason, 16 countries, including my own, issued a statement to the effect that, in their view, the use of symbols was a fact of life, official and, what is more, something that should be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nobody questioned the European Union’s symbols during the referendum campaigns that resulted in the non-ratification of the Constitution. Let us be serious: can anyone remember large sections of the French and Dutch population saying ‘no’ to the Constitution because it referred to Union symbols? I, for one, cannot, and I campaigned actively in France. There could be other reasons that may or may not be common to a number of people, but the matter of symbols was not one of them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of course, I feel Spanish because I am European and European because I am Spanish. This means that when I see my country’s flag next to that of the 12 stars, the conviction that both are part of my life grows stronger. When I see the President-in-Office of the Council appear with both the French flag and the European Union flag, I also feel proud.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, I feel proud to have been cheered, like many of you, when someone has received humanitarian aid or has noticed our election observation team and recognises us by the flag and applauds it. We would be foolish to deny ourselves what others recognise with friendship and with joy.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Union is without any doubt at a crossroads in its evolution, when it is of the utmost importance to acknowledge the need to move forward by tackling all the current complex issues that potentially could stalemate the dynamics of the European integration process. In this process, the European symbols are a crucial linking element for developing a positive identity at European level, complementary to and not replacing well-established national identities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The absence of the European symbols in the rejected Lisbon Treaty was most regrettable from the point of view of the critical democratic deficit currently confronting the European Union. The claim that their inclusion in the Lisbon Treaty would be inappropriate turned out to be profoundly unrealistic for there is no doubt that they would not pose any peril to the concepts on which the EU was built.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, in order to increase the popular support for and commitment to the European Union in the forthcoming years, it is imperative to maintain and adjust these symbolic elements, so as to bind the European institutions and decision-making processes to acknowledgement of the ‘demos’ factor.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Symbols do indeed generate an emotional attachment to an organisation or country dear to us. As we gaze at flags or mottos, listen to anthems and even as we handle coins, we identify directly with a particular country or organisation. The European Union does of course also have symbols of this nature facilitating identification and emotional attachment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The blue flag with 12 golden stars, the ‘Ode to Joy’ from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Europe Day celebrated on 9 May and the euro, which is the official currency of 15 Member States, are established, familiar and generally accepted symbols. Initially they were symbols of the Communities, and they have now become symbols of the European Union. Taken together with the Union's slogan or motto, namely ‘United in Diversity’, these symbols encapsulate the essence of the European project.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a member of the Convention, I very much regret that the Union symbols described in the European Constitution never came into being. They were perceived as features of a pseudo-state and therefore deleted from the text of the Lisbon Treaty. Even so, however, I believe that they have not lost any of their character or their appeal to European citizens. These symbols continue to be vehicles of the values on which the European Union is based. They are an expression of the feeling of community felt by its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is right, therefore, that the move to use the European symbols should have arisen precisely in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0350/2008) by Alojz Peterle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the White Paper entitled ‘Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’ (2008/2115(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="sl">This report concerns everyone – the sick and the healthy. Health is one of the key social and political issues on which the future of the European Union hangs. The importance of health to the economy is clearly stated in the Lisbon Strategy. Health is one of the most important assets of human life. Due to worrying health trends, especially the rise in cancer cases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, and despite the improvements in curative medicine, this asset is under increasing threat. In addition, there are new challenges such as ageing population, climate change, rising food prices and globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">There has been talk of pandemics and bioterrorism. On the one hand the World Health Organization has forecast an epidemic rise in cancer cases in future years, and on the other there are ever-stronger demands for patients and medical workers to have freedom of movement. Health systems and their financing are coming under increasing pressure. In recent years the cost of medicines has been rising faster than overall health costs, giving rise to public concern about equality of healthcare and the sustainability of health systems.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Citizens are worried that there will not be sufficient healthcare for all. They are not interested in debates about competences; they are primarily interested in the best way to be healthy. They are also concerned about equality of healthcare, which is considerable among the Member States, as also within the countries themselves. As far as cancer is concerned, differences in survival rates between the new and old Member States are such that we could justifiably talk of an iron curtain in health. All this is a reason for health to be afforded greater importance in the European political agenda. We are not talking about Any Other Business but about Survival. That is why we need a common strategic approach.</p>
      <p sl="sl">At the end of 2007 the European Commission adopted a health strategy entitled ‘Together for Health’. This strategy is a product of the commitment by the Member States and the Union to respect the common values and principles of health policy when ensuring the conditions for realising citizens’ rights and responsibilities in their personal healthcare throughout their life, in their active involvement in decision-making and the adjustment of healthcare to patients’ needs, in reducing inequalities in healthcare among different social groups, Member States and the regions within them, in understanding the investment in healthcare as a condition of economic development, and in the consistent inclusion of health in policies at all levels.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is clear that the health sector really needs a long-term strategic and comprehensive approach, which will require all the main actors in the Member States and at European Union level to work in cooperation. If we want to improve cooperation we need to determine which forms of interinstitutional cooperation can enhance the effectiveness of our joint efforts.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We need a key strategic shift in the area of disease prevention. Although the importance of preventing disease has been highlighted for many years, only 3% of the health budgets of the Member States is devoted to that purpose. At the same time we know that it is precisely a prevention policy that would help us to achieve much better results. Forty percent of diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles, and a third of cancers are also preventable. One of the main messages in this report is the call on the Commission to prepare an ambitious plan of preventive measures for the entire five-year period.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and everyone who contributed to the consensus opinion on what needs to be done to improve health.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Vassiliou.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, for this report, and Members of Parliament for their interest in the white paper putting forward an EU health strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am delighted that Parliament supports the health objectives and principles of the white paper.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes this report, and fully agrees with the key issues it raises, in particular the need to address health inequalities, to focus on promoting health by encouraging healthy lifestyles and to help prevent diseases.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to say that these issues are at the very top of the Commission’s health agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Health inequalities between different regions in the EU and between different socioeconomic groups are a growing concern, and the Commission plans to bring forward action later next year to help bridge the health gap across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully shares your views about the need to promote healthy lifestyles, in particular as regards nutrition. We all agree that this requires action targeted at citizens of all ages, in schools, the workplace and other settings.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a key component of the health strategy, and initiatives will be developed in the next couple of years. In the mean time, we are actively pursuing our strategies on nutrition, overweight and obesity and on alcohol-related harm.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also fully agrees with Parliament about the need to step up our efforts to prevent diseases.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to encouraging healthy lifestyles, we share your views about the need to support effective screening to detect diseases, in particular cancer, at an early stage, and to foster greater exchange of best practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is actively supporting the implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening and has recently updated the EU guidelines on breast and cervical cancer. But we need to do more to help health systems fight cancer.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to announce that the Commission plans to launch an EU platform for action on cancer next year to help Member States exchange knowledge and good practice in the prevention and treatment of cancer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes Parliament’s emphasis on the role that a healthy workforce plays in delivering the Lisbon agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now let me comment on a few additional issues that the report raises.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament calls for the establishment of European centres of reference. These would be leading centres of expertise in particular conditions, such as rare diseases, that require a combination of expertise and resources that many Member States do not have.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will build on the principles agreed between Member States for such centres and will continue work to promote such centres in the framework of the future directive on patients’ rights in cross-border health care.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament also underlines the need for effective measures to tackle the rising problem of resistance to antibiotics. The Commission shares this concern and is actively supporting Member States in implementing the Council recommendation on anti-microbial resistance. We will present a report on this next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission endorses the views expressed about the need for health and social policies to work closely together. Mainstreaming health concerns in other policies is indeed a key principle of our strategy, and we are currently exploring synergies on a wide range of issues between these two policy areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the Commission and Parliament share the same vision about the key health issues that we need to address.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time has now come to take forward work on the strategy and translate words into action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will work closely with Parliament, the Council, the Member States and civil society in transforming the strategy objectives into better health for all across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I thank you for your support and I look forward to hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, health, alongside our freedom, is the most important thing for the majority of us. Health is a prerequisite for a happy life and for a successful society. It is necessary to constantly repeat and emphasise that caring for our own health and for the health of those who are close to us is a personal responsibility of each one of us. Health is the result of our genetic heritage, of the lifestyle and environment in which we live. Our upbringing, acquired habits, nutrition, exercise, working environment and housing all influence our health. The influence of healthcare on health comes last in this list.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Community is quite rightly responsible for the protection of public health. However, health services and the way in which they are organised, their quality and their funding are the complete responsibility of the EU Member States. Our common goal is to ensure the quality, safety and wide accessibility of health care for all those who need it. Each country seeks out its own way of providing the best possible healthcare services to its citizens in this difficult environment. The European Union has added value: the diversity of these independent systems, the opportunity to share in the successes and avoid the mistakes made by our friends.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Healthcare is a very broad issue, as highlighted by those who spoke before me. Consequently, I personally regret that here in the European Parliament it is not clear who in our midst really deals with health and healthcare. One day we see healthcare as an internal market service, the next day as a social security issue, and on yet another occasion as a public health issue. I would like to call on the President and on each one of us, on this occasion when we are debating this important document, to consider the possibility of establishing a European Parliament Committee on Health during the next parliamentary term.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, health is one of the most important resources for every person. The European Union’s healthcare strategy for the 21st century should guarantee a high level of uniform health protection available to all throughout Europe. Unfortunately the health systems of the Member States today differ widely and uniform and effective action on health is not guaranteed throughout Europe for citizens.</p>
      <p sl="et">I am pleased to welcome the European Commission White Paper on healthcare strategy although, like the rapporteur, I am of the view that the White Paper does not set specific quantifiable and measurable objectives whose attainment could and should produce tangible results.</p>
      <p sl="et">Healthcare requires effective political support in all areas and at all levels. Hence my appeal to the Commission that in future it should integrate public health issues into all EU policy areas and in that regard it should not forget gender mainstreaming in an enhanced healthcare policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we are currently discussing this White Paper on health for 2008-2013, and health is of course a fundamental right for us all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have a series of challenges to face: cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and, above all, the ageing of the population, not to mention the constant threat of pandemics. Our fellow citizens expect a great deal from us when it comes to these health issues: when we talk about the value added of the European Union, it is in these areas where they are severely affected and where their expectations of us are highest!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, this White Paper is pathetically trivial and offers nothing that is in any way concrete. Fortunately, our colleague Mr Peterle has vastly improved its content. Perhaps repetition is indeed necessary: on numerous occasions in this House we have talked about these health issues and we are all in favour of health for all and health of a high standard through an integrated approach. Investing in prevention is important. We want it but we are not doing it because we are constantly coming up against overly timid budgets, notably when it comes to research. We have not yet realised that prevention would cost a great deal less than a cure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is essential to take into account the ageing of the population and its consequent effects on society: economic effects, social effects and health effects. However, we need to ensure that there is less talk and more action: it is vital that we respond to our citizens’ expectations. There are very clear messages that must concentrate on good practices: the need for physical activity, a balanced diet and, above all, responsibility: responsibility on the part of the EU Member States but also responsibility on the part of each European citizen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my political group supports the Commission’s white paper on the health strategy. In particular we support the focus on prevention, education and encouraging healthier lifestyles. Planning to protect our citizens from health threats and pandemics, and aiming to reduce health inequalities across the EU, are very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need new guidelines on cancer screening, a directive on organ donation, improved surveillance mechanisms to respond to health threats and improved exchange of best practice. But, with regard to e-health, I should sound a note of caution. This is an area where we need to draw up precise rules defining a clear framework. It should be clear that it should not exclude those who are not Internet-literate, and should not replace a visit to consult the doctor. This said, I can see many advantages, but we must also be aware of the potential perils.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, what health policy also needs at EU level is clear focus. In my work as shadow rapporteur on this report, I have detected a real sense that there are too many different working groups and work streams, expert groups and task forces, many of which have been set up as presidencies’ pet projects, or because of pressures from members of this House or from other interest groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe the EU has a lot of value to add in the field of health, but that resources should be properly focused and provide value for money.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would urge colleagues to vote for my Amendment 2 calling for the Commission to launch a review of current work streams. I would also urge colleagues to support my amendments on protecting our citizens’ health from dangers at work. I would like to ask the Commission to respond in particular to my Amendments 1 and 6 regarding exposure to substances toxic for reproduction.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the forthcoming proposals for review of the Carcinogens Directive, it is vital that substances toxic for reproduction are included. I understand that the Commission has made a U-turn on this, and would be grateful if the Commission would explain its position.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, everybody agrees that health is one of the most precious values for our citizens, yet, as we all know, under Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty, health falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States. This obvious antithesis is not just a strange peculiarity in EU law; it is, in practice, highly obstructive to our endeavours to achieve optimal health goals within the EU, and one wonders why this situation has been allowed to proceed unchanged for such a long time. The reason, of course, is a financial one. Health care is very costly, and improving it to the extent of achieving the desired equality across the EU would mean large increases in health costs for some EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">So we can all come to this Parliament and criticise the shameful differences in life expectancy, in infant mortality rates and cancer survival from rich to poor Member States, but most of us fail to point the blame where it should lie, on the EU’s inability to secure the provision of financial assistance to poorer members in order to help them catch up in terms of the level of health care, and thus stop their governments from opposing the possibility of removing health from the sole province of national competence.</p>
      <p sl="de">This, one could argue, is a sad reflection on the fundamental values we uphold in the EU in practice, whereby we accord greater importance in terms of competence to internal market rules for our businesses, for example, than to health care for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">My position is that the time has come for an urgent change to Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty and this can only be achieved by a concerted effort by the Council, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">As parliamentarians, we should do our utmost to bring about the required change. That having been said, the most important aspect of health strategy in practical terms is, of course, disease prevention. Everybody knows that smoking, obesity, alcohol, drugs, high sugar intake and a stressful, unhealthy lifestyle in general are our health’s greatest enemies, but are we doing enough to free our citizens from these curses? Not really.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take smoking, for example. How can we claim to be doing everything we can to prevent people from smoking when we still subsidise tobacco-growing in the EU, we still allow tax-free cigarette sales on planes and ships travelling to and from the EU, we still have a relatively low tax on tobacco considering the enormous health cost of cigarette smokers, we still have indirect tobacco ads on our TV screens, and we still have laws relating to smoking which have hardly been fully implemented in the EU?</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not have time to say much more about prevention, but I think the main point of what I am saying is the need to change the competence rule relating to health.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work. It is absolutely right for us to deal with this important subject today, following up the strategic document prepared by the Commission last year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The importance of prevention, proper nutrition, air and drinking water quality, a healthy lifestyle, early detection of diseases and potential swift treatment of the latter should all be emphasised. It has been noted that currently major differences exist between individual countries and different social groups regarding access to healthcare. This indicates a clear lack of social cohesion. Such inequalities are also manifest in terms of survival rates for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other conditions. There is a worrying increase in the number of mentally ill persons. Treatment methods used leave much to be desired, too. I have in mind in particular the over-use of antibiotics and steroids.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Healthcare systems are also cause for concern, as they often prove inadequate. We all appreciate how precious our health is, and know that our biological life is limited. In this context, I would remind the House that the Polish poet Alexander Fredra advised his readers not to neglect their well-being, because to do so would endanger not only their health but their very lives.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, let me express my thanks to Mr Peterle for his attempt to add some additional policies and actions to the Community strategy on health. He has aimed at promoting equal access to an integrated health system as a basic, inalienable right of every citizen.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must therefore work hard to make the organisations concerned politically aware of the principle that as far as health is concerned, funding is equivalent to investment. At this point, let me add that I agree with Mr Matsakis’s position. We should concentrate on disease prevention through the promotion of healthy lifestyles and the provision of optimum treatment, as well as on investment in new technologies and research.</p>
      <p sl="el">Our goal must be a cross-sector policy to be coordinated at various levels. It will aim to meet the key challenges of an ageing population and the huge inequalities affecting the health systems of the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">When we talk about the European Union’s common approach to health, our first consideration must be consolidating standards for the provision of healthcare services. The European Union’s goal must be to eliminate the disparities between the new and old Member States, which are still quite significant.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Since the individual Member States have different goals in the area of health policy, the health sector across the European Union needs long-term and strategic cooperation so that consensus can be reached. It is also necessary to invest in prevention and public education programmes. Better results can be achieved with a prevention policy and it is well known that almost half of all diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I agree with Mr Peterle’s request to the Commission to draw up a long-term plan for preventive actions for the above reason. This could help to improve the European population’s state of health. Research in medical areas also contributes to prevention and makes diseases easier to cure. For example, the European Union does not invest enough funds in cancer research: EU investment is almost one fifth of what the US invests. Rectifying this shortcoming would be in the interest of all European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A useful idea in terms of raising patient awareness is the establishment of information and guidance centres to help patients, the healthcare personnel and the entire health sector. Once these goals are met, the European Union will be much closer to achieving a common approach to health.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I wholeheartedly support the report by Mr Peterle on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, entitled ‘Together for Health: a Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’. In particular, I welcome this report because it deals with one of the most urgent challenges facing the European Union and the entire world. It should be highlighted that this is the first strategic programme presenting a comprehensive Union approach to health policy. It lays down the values adopted by the Community and the aims it is setting itself in this area. It amounts to a Union healthcare strategy that stands out against other health systems, and could indeed serve as an example for the latter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am glad to hear that the strategy has been positively received in the Member States. I am also glad to learn that certain countries have already taken action with a view to developing a common standpoint and incorporating the strategy into their national health plans. Slovenia is but one example. Action of this nature has also been taken in Poland.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The financing of healthcare services makes a significant contribution to the budget deficit in many countries of the European Union. It is essential to take this fact into account when considering health strategy. Accordingly, I believe that the strategic plan should be considered in conjunction with methods of financing public healthcare in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should also like to mention an issue that we have previously debated. I am referring to new information technologies and their effect on children and young people. Unregulated use of the Internet and computer games, addiction and related conditions are becoming increasingly serious problems for our society and civilisation. Children and young people are the worst affected. The Commission and the European Council are currently developing a sound method of cooperating in the healthcare area and it would be right for us to be involved in the implementation of this project.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which has improved on the initial text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This White Paper proposed by the Commission is a first step in setting clear and beneficial objectives in the field of health, but it is unfortunate that it does not respond to the challenges of quality healthcare and equal access. The report on the table today has not taken over the initial proposals concerning self-medication and that is a good thing. In my opinion, trivialising or even encouraging self-medication is totally inappropriate in terms of the healthcare we must strive towards. ‘Together for Health’ must not become ‘every man for himself in times of illness’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The introduction of the idea of an active patient is a worrying concept: because it is not accompanied by a clear definition, the door is left open to different interpretations. Encouraging patients to take responsibility for their own care and urging population groups to provide their own responses to certain health needs are further proposals that must be treated carefully. We must remember that health is a very specific field that requires a very high level of competence and the issues involved can often be a matter of life and death. The proposals encouraging self-medication, in conjunction with the concept of individual responsibility, do not seem to respond to the health challenge we have to tackle and they move away from the concepts of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is one other point that I must criticise: facilitating the mobility of health professionals. This could have very serious consequences on the territorial distribution of health personnel and aggravate what are already very precarious situations in certain Member States. Rather than encouraging the mobility of health professionals, it would be preferable to put the emphasis on the exchange of good health practices among all the Member States. I also recognise that web-based health resources must be encouraged. This is a positive and innovative initiative that is nevertheless only available to a minority of people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I naturally support the amendments tabled by my colleagues concerning health in the workplace. This is a crucial topic because work-related health problems are becoming more and more common.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to draw attention to three issues in this debate. Firstly, there are notable health inequalities between the old and the new Member States. The cumulative effect of these inequalities is manifested in significant differences in terms of life expectancy. This can vary by 9 years for women and by as much as 13 years for men. We should strive to achieve a substantial reduction of these differences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, a substantial increase in investment aimed at disease prevention is needed. To date, barely 3% of investment is allocated to this purpose. It is well known, however, that up to 40% of diseases are linked to an unhealthy lifestyle and could largely be effectively prevented.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, as obesity is becoming an increasingly serious disease of our civilisation, it is essential to promote a healthy lifestyle. Favourable terms should also be made available for healthy organic food produced without the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides. This type of farming is not very cost-effective, however. It therefore requires increased financial support within the framework of the common agricultural system.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, many important issues relating to health and healthcare are raised in the document under discussion. General access to healthcare is guaranteed in the constitutions of individual Member States. Respect for the competences of the Member States in the area of healthcare and freedom of choice of health services are positive features. Nonetheless, I should like to draw attention to the danger threatening my fellow citizens because of the Polish Government’s current plans to transform all healthcare entities into commercial profit-making companies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposed reforms transcend the limits of freedom to make an individual choice of healthcare system. They threaten fundamental human rights such as the right to life and healthcare. The scale of the threat should make it incumbent upon the European Commission to establish guidelines preventing public authorities from relinquishing control of public hospitals privatised against the wishes of Polish society and of the President of the Republic of Poland.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his well-prepared response to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are all aware that it is Member States’ individual responsibility to decide on the organisation and delivery of their health services and medical care. However, this should not mean that they neglect serious health cooperation at EU level. There are a wide range of health issues, such as the prevention of pandemics and the movement of patients or health professionals, where Member States cannot act effectively in isolation and where action at EU level is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU action can be valuable in creating pan-European networks of expertise which permit exchange of best practice in fields such as e-health, nanotechnology, rare disease treatments or centres of excellence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU, in partnership with Member States, has made important progress in protecting health, for example in the area of legislating on tobacco advertising, in the area of blood products, and indeed in the launch of the European Centre for Disease Control.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to strengthen action to reduce health inequities across the EU-27, in particular through exchange of best practice and through better public information on citizens’ cross-border health-care rights. We need to legislate in this area quickly, and not let ECJ judgments be the patients’ sole guide around Europe. We need to respond with proper legislation. Furthermore, comprehensive health impact assessments and evaluation on all legislation across the board should be carried out, in order to provide a platform for joined-up thinking and better enable decision-makers to assess the real cost to human health of any policy initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">This should be done in the same way that environmental impact assessments are now taken for granted as a way of informing legislators, and are a prerequisite for the formulation of most EU policies. Even with the backdrop of the economic and financial crisis today, health is our ultimate wealth.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I wanted to speak about two things. The first is how we must deal with excessive antibiotics prescription, which is handled very well in the report.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need only look at ourselves here in the European Parliament, or I need only look at myself. I would probably not be standing here today if we did not have effective antibiotics. I have been ill a number of times and just like many of you here in this Chamber, I am sure, have been saved by antibiotics. Unfortunately, our children’s chances of getting this kind of help in the future are being jeopardised because we allow doctors to prescribe antibiotics when they are not needed and even sell antibiotics without a prescription.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need means of control and incentives to stop doctors meeting with patients to make money, so that they do not prescribe antibiotics when they are not necessary. I believe that the EU has an extremely important role to play here, to disseminate different ways of working successfully to combat this kind of excessive prescription.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The second question which I wanted to address concerns inequality in health, which has also been raised by several earlier speakers. There is another aspect of inequality in health. It is not just a matter of inequality between countries. There is also inequality within countries. The WHO organised a special commission which looked at class differences in health. It boldly stated that ‘social justice is a matter of life and death’ and this is something which we must discuss openly in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is completely unacceptable that there are such big differences within countries. There are good examples where class differences in health have been successfully overcome, but there are also very bad examples. I myself am very concerned at what is happening in the capital of my own country. A system has suddenly been introduced there as a result of which doctors are moving away from socially deprived and poor areas, where medical care is most needed, to areas where people are healthiest and most wealthy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I believe that the EU should collect statistics and information so that voters, and also those who take decisions on health care, can be given clear advice on what measures lead to greater social justice in health and which do not.</p>

      <p sl="ro">To respond the major challenges that the health sector is facing in the European Union, we need action plans which should include promoting a better state of health , public education and disease prevention programmes, especially for those diseases related to food, obesity, alcohol and drug consumption and smoking.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Early detection and diagnosis, as well as the supply of proper treatment for chronic diseases, especially cancer, will ensure quality of life for people who are affected by these illnesses. This is why the exchange of best practices in all medical assistance fields within the European Union will contribute to increasing citizen welfare and health. I believe it is important to promote a healthy lifestyle inside families, in schools and at work in order to set the path for a healthy life model and to promote healthy ageing, both for the current generation and future ones.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We must be especially concerned about our children’s interests, developing provisions concerning maternity and parental leave, taking into consideration the effect the presence of parents has on a child’s physical and mental development. It is just as important to improve the medical care system for pregnant women and to inform them about the effects of smoking and drinking.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to compliment the rapporteur and also point out that the only way for us to tackle the challenges of the 21st century is to improve public health. The saying ‘all the medicine in the world cannot replace exercise, but exercise can replace all the medicine in the world’ is timeless. We should not simply preach healthy living and healthy nutrition. The time has come to encourage people who are not consciously ruining their health but rather strengthening it through various means, including financial. Recommendations from the European Commission on this subject would be of great value. An acute problem for the new Member States is the lack of specialists. In some places half of all newly qualified doctors seek employment in other EU Member States, where salaries are much higher. That way the new Member States are supporting and strengthening the health services of their richer neighbours. I am not suggesting any restrictions on the free movement of citizens. However, a solidarity and compensation fund is necessary for the abatement of the consequences of this loss of specialists.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, matters relating to health fall within the competence of individual Member States. This should not, however, represent an obstacle when it comes to taking joint action aimed at protecting the health of Europeans. The key objectives are laid down in the White Paper. They include promoting health in an ageing Europe, protecting citizens against dangers to their health and supporting dynamic health systems. These objectives cannot be achieved without substantial involvement by local and regional authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The latter must therefore be fully involved in implementation of this strategy. The White Paper raises the important issue of health inequalities and of the variations in health levels between individual countries and social groups. The provision of certain healthcare services in most of the new Member States is low. This gap must be bridged. It is therefore necessary to strengthen action aimed at doing away with inequality and to make this a priority objective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another task identified in the White Paper relates to the need to emphasise and enhance the importance of programmes involving health awareness, notably those concerning nutrition. Sound nutrition and a healthy lifestyle can prevent many chronic diseases. That is why educational programmes on how to watch one’s diet and engage in physical activity from a very early age are so very important.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions and I will deal with some of the points raised by them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Oviir and Mrs Grossetête said that the white paper was too general. But the aim of the white paper is to set up a number of general principles and objectives to guide Community health action for the years to come. It would be very difficult to set quantifiable targets on such broad and general objectives and on such a wide range of issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission does fully agree that quantifiable targets are a good means to drive change and to achieve results. We feel, however, that it is better to consider such targets within each individual policy initiative in the framework of the strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of speakers referred to inequalities in health, for example Mr Janowski, Mr Adamou, Mrs Belohorská, Mrs Doyle, Mr Kuźmiuk and Mrs Westlund. We fully agree with the concerns raised and with the need to help to bridge the health gap. The Commission will be presenting a communication next year but, in the mean time, we will help to channel structural funds for health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Willmott asked a number of questions. She made the point that there are too many work streams in health. But this is the reason why the EU health strategy adopted in 2007 aims to bring together, under a coherent framework, all policies that impact on health. The Commission is looking at the different structures in the health sector to achieve synergies between structures and to ensure that work is done in an efficient and an effective manner without duplication.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Willmott also asked about the Carcinogens Directive. The Commission has consulted the social partners on the possible revision of the 2004 directive in this area and is currently commissioning a study to be concluded in early 2010 on the options for amending this directive. The results of this study will enable the Commission to decide on an appropriate way forward. EU legislation on health and safety at work, specifically the 1998 directive on all chemical agents, already covers protection at work against all chemicals, including those with a toxic effect on reproduction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Westlund raised the issue of antibiotic resistance. The Commission is working closely with the ECDC. The ECDC work plan for 2008 includes antimicrobial resistance among its priority actions. In addition it plans to organise, on an annual basis, an EU Antibiotic Awareness Day. This event is aimed at strengthening public perception and knowledge of issues relating to all antimicrobial resistance. The first Awareness Day will take place on 18 November 2008. We are also collaborating closely with the ECDC on the preparation of a second report on Member States’ implementation of the Council recommendation of 2002.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, and all Members for their support for the health strategy that we have developed.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks for this rich and complex debate. I am pleased that almost all your contributions contained three key words: the first is ‘together’, the second is ‘inequality’ and the third is ‘prevention’. ‘Together’ means more cooperation at Member State level, as well as European Union level, more partnerships, including the regional and local communities, and more complementarity. I agree with all those who said that the competence of the Member States must not be an excuse for not doing jointly what the individual countries cannot do, and there are an increasing number of such challenges.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The fact that there are so many inequalities, which we have been warning about, means that there is a lack of knowledge sharing. If the chance of surviving cancer is 10% lower in one place than another, it means that information and knowledge have not reached that place, even though it is available to others, including neighbouring countries. Here we have to achieve some kind of dynamics based on already available knowledge. The principal message and advice should be that we should use available knowledge and share good practice.</p>
      <p sl="sl">As regards dynamics, I would like to add that diseases spread rapidly, which is why we also require political dynamics and political innovation. As regards the White Paper, I would like to say that it is a very good framework for what we aim to do. Its purpose is not to address all the specific issues addressed in other documents and other resolutions. It should give a framework, and, as someone said, we now have for the first time a comprehensive framework for the values, indicators, strategies and measures. This is the basis on which we can move forward.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In conclusion I would like to add that I have particular difficulty with the amendments proposed by the Socialist Group. They proposed six amendments which were rejected by ENVI. I find it difficult to overrule the arguments which ENVI used to express a different viewpoint. I cannot support those amendments now, because this is a plenary session and this topic was covered by other resolutions. If these amendments are approved, we will have an unbalanced picture, because other categories of the population will not be treated with such attention. It is not only about workers but pensioners too, and schoolchildren. I insist, of course, on the arguments I gave at the ENVI meeting.</p>

      <p sl="it">Health is something that has a cost but has no price. Investment in health is the most effective and efficient investment there can be for a society tailored to people's needs. This investment is a joint responsibility on the part of individuals who must adopt healthy lifestyles by behaving responsibly, healthcare staff who must abide by their code of professional ethics, and national and regional governments, which must pay particular attention to the sustainability of health systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">Careful attention must furthermore be paid to the need for integrated social and health policies catering adequately for new requirements. Overcoming inequality, coping with exacting health demands, keeping up with the epidemiological changes underway and ensuring ever more active cooperation among Member States and regions: all of these requirements are duly addressed in the report by Mr Peterle, whom I wish to thank for his excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">It is encouraging to see that the European Parliament adopted the Resolution concerning the European Commission’s White Paper “Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013”=. Beyond the provisions concerning the health-related strategy, I noticed a weak point in the paper: the absence of quantifiable objectives aimed at ensuring an increased efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As a representative of a country whose medical system is of very poor quality, which is reflected in the population’s worrying state of health, I would like to stress the importance of putting words into practice but also the need to show greater solidarity at European Union level in order to offer all citizens decent medical care services.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Romania has numerous sad tales to tell in relation to health. It is the EU country with the highest number of tuberculosis patients and it is in the penultimate place when it comes to the quality of diabetes treatment although diabetes is the disease with the highest predisposition. One in ten Romanians suffers from hepatic disorders. A quarter of Romanian children have health issues. Cancer-related mortality has increased worryingly in comparison to the rest of the EU. The mortality rate for cardiovascular causes is 61% of the total number of deaths while in the EU it is 37%. Romania is the European champion when it comes to delivered prescriptions, hospital admissions and surgical interventions but it is also the country with the shortest life expectancy in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Allergy is the endemic disease of our time. It has marched steadily across Europe since the Second World War. A third of our children have an allergy, and if we do not take action, pretty soon a half of the population of Europe will suffer from one allergy or another. The causes of these allergies are chemically treated foods and polluted environments. The symptoms of allergy are triggered by chemicals, natural and artificial food additives, spices, pollen and other natural substances, and animal hair. In Hungary, ragweed is a particular problem.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Unfortunately the European Union has no allergy strategy at present, as the Commission confirmed in response to my question. Allergy sufferer associations within civil society, and millions of affected European citizens, are counting on the introduction of allergy legislation at European level. Let us do something to help prevent allergies, to tackle the main causes and to safeguard those who suffer from allergies. Active engagement would underpin our focus on the health of the citizens of the European Union and their everyday concerns.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to draw attention to the worrying tendency in Europe, where more and more young people suffer from mental problems. Many young people in Europe suffer from stress; indicators of substance abuse, especially alcohol and drugs, are increasing. These aspects, separately and combined, can lead to serious mental disorders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recent tragedies in Finland indicate that more than ever Member States need to pay attention to young people in providing measures for preventing bad health, especially mental health.</p>
      <p sl="en">A holistic and proactive approach to dealing with the roots of mental problems and illnesses is crucial. A safe living environment (preventing domestic violence and substance abuse), reducing stress-causing factors in school and at home, prevention and awareness-raising should be of the highest priority. No school can replace a caring family where parents see their responsibility in teaching their children the basics of social and ethical values.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to include all actors in society to achieve the set goals. Various voluntary and youth organisations in particular are crucial providers of a safe environment in leisure-time activities and of non-formal education/awareness-raising on mental-health-related issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore I call for a holistic and proactive approach including guaranteeing better mental health and therefore a better future for young people.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I salute the fact that the Peterle Report approaches and emphasises the urgent need to take active measures to recruit and retain health professionals.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the World Health Organisation, the migration of 2% of the physicians from a country should be a code red signal for the authorities. In Romania, 4% of Romanian physicians requested papers to leave and work abroad and the same percentage was registered in 2007 as well. Therefore, not only did we cross the level considered to be a code red threshold, but we also reached double that percentage. From the beginning of the year up until 1 September 2008, 957 persons asked the Romanian Physicians’ College (CMR) for moral integrity certificates which will allow them to work abroad.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is obvious that a health system cannot function without physicians. I believe that this is a worrying phenomenon not just for Romania but for all of Europe and the absence of qualified individuals who can treat European patients must preoccupy the Member States and the Union to the highest degree.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First, I would like to say how happy I am that we have recently seen more and more reports and strategies on the importance of health.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I myself as a 2009 Budget expert have tried to speak for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). My initiatives have been received favourably by both ENVI and the Committee on Budgets.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As Mr Peterle has pointed out, there is a close connection between the new health hazards and climate change. On 7 October, the Committee on Budgets adopted a research project I proposed, ‘Comprehensive Research on Health, the Environment and Climate Change – Improvement in Inside and Outside Air Quality’. This 4-million-euro initiative will be managed by the Hungarian headquarters of the Regional Environmental Centre for central and eastern Europe (REC) and will cover nine countries (Austria, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Serbia and Slovakia). At the same time the project will examine the links between health, environmental protection, transport and climate change and their effects in schools.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards ECDC ratification, I also support the rapporteur. So that the Agency can meet its increased responsibilities, I suggested releasing it from the margin set by the Commission. ENVI adopted this unanimously, and it is to be hoped that at the end of the October plenary Parliament will decide on this too.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Health is one of the greatest blessings a human being can enjoy in life. Unfortunately, worrying trends such as an increase in the number of cases of cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes are making us aware of the extent to which health is now endangered. We are confronted with the challenges of climate change, globalisation, the ageing population, along with the threat of pandemics and biological terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The marked rise in the cost of medicines in recent years is also cause for concern. It has meant that many EU citizens simply cannot afford medicines. In addition, the healthcare systems of certain EU Member States need to undergo radical reform in order to eliminate tremendous inequalities. For example, there is a difference of 9 years in the life expectancy of women and 13 years for men.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Investing in healthcare policies concerning the earliest years of a person's life should also be a priority issue. It is important, however, not to allow a situation to develop whereby preventing the birth of disabled children or children suffering from chronic diseases would be generally accepted. Aid for the parents of sick children should be promoted instead.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, I should like to emphasise the need to respect the competences of the Member States in the area of healthcare and freedom of choice of medical services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Clearly, health also has a bearing on the economy. Investment in healthcare should therefore not be perceived simply as an outlay, but also as an important element of investment in improving the quality of human capital and a key social and political issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">In the interests of health protection, we must face up to the challenges identified. The main competence for maintaining and promoting health standards lies with the Member States. Nonetheless, there are many areas, especially as regards transnational problems, where it is our task to support the Member States as much as possible if they are unable to take effective action.</p>
      <p sl="de">The major problem we face is the grave inequalities between the Member States, on the one hand, and within the individual Member States, on the other. Life expectancy in the ‘old’ Member States is on average 10 years higher than in the new Member States. Our task is to diffuse, across the Member States, the tried and tested procedures which have proved their worth. Through appropriate awareness-raising measures for citizens, the intention is to adapt and harmonise standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Health is a vital asset for all of us, and it is also a key economic factor. We must therefore do even more to curb the dramatic increase in the incidence of cancer, for example. For that to be achieved, it is essential to mainstream health in all policy areas and promote the development of new technologies and innovations.</p>

      <p sl="en">I commend the new focus on rare diseases, Alzheimer’s, and research into mental illness and men’s health, as well as the continued focus on recognised conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Health is one of the most important values in a human’s life. The worrying increase of the number of individuals who suffer from cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity in spite of the progress made with the cures for these diseases is an important issue to be dealt with. The problems linked to excessive weight and malnutrition, improper diet and HIV/AIDS are challenges that endanger the health of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The differences between the new and the old EU Member States in the survival rates for cancer patients are so large that we can speak of an “iron curtain in the health sector”. The European Union must consolidate its actions to reduce inequalities between the Member States, especially by exchanging best practices in different fields and by promoting public education for better medical care by supporting innovations in the health systems, and it must also propose enforcement mechanisms for structured cooperation between EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We must define fundamental health values, a system of EU health indicators and ways of reducing the inequalities which exist in the health sector. We must invest in health, we must adopt methods for promoting health at all ages, and we must adopt measures related to tobacco, food, alcohol and other factors affecting health.</p>

It reads: ‘whereas the increasing cross-border nature of banking in Europe and the need to respond in a coordinated way to adverse shocks, as well as the need to deal with systemic risks effectively, require divergences between the national regimes of Member States to be reduced to the greatest extent possible; whereas there is a need to move beyond the studies that the European Commission has already carried out in this regard and to amend Directive 94/19/EC as soon as possible to provide the same level of protection for bank deposits across the whole European Union in order to preserve financial stability and depositors’ confidence and avoid distortions of competition’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to offer my explanation of vote. Just like the last speaker, I do not think anyone can disagree with the goals of the report in terms of promoting social inclusion and combating poverty.</p>

Right across the European Union, right across my own country, right across the city that I represent, London, the greatest city in the world, we see a number of local community groups tackling poverty ‘at the coalface’, without any intervention from the state. They understand the problems, and the communities are acting together. We have to create the right conditions for local communities to tackle these problems: if you want to look for the solutions, please go to the website of the Centre for Social Justice in my constituency in London.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, poverty is a multi-faceted phenomenon. It is generally linked to unemployment, and in particular to long-term unemployment. That is why work is considered the best way of preventing poverty. Work is not the only way of preventing poverty, however, as illustrated by the many cases of poverty amongst working people. We should recall that 78 million individuals are threatened by poverty in the European Union. This represents 16% of the Union's citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All levels of public authority must join forces with the social partners, civil society organisations and individual citizens. Social policy and labour market policy need to be better organised and to become more efficient. Sustained and far-reaching efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion are needed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also remember that legislative social protection programmes should have a preventive role. They should serve to promote social cohesion and to facilitate social integration. One of the important points in the report concerns the elimination of child poverty. Particular attention should be paid to the cases of children being brought up by single parents, in large families or in immigrant families. Effective solutions are needed to prevent such people from becoming socially marginalised.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I can support this resolution from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because it includes my specific proposals to combat black market labour and particularly undeclared work.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am particularly gratified by the support for my proposal to ask the European Commission to develop a pilot tool based on models such as the 2 Plus project in Luxembourg, co-financed by the European Social Fund, which is aimed at curbing undeclared work by making it less appealing through a huge simplification of administrative requirements for employers, whilst guaranteeing social security cover for workers, attractive tax rates for the employer, including through the deduction of charges concerning locally based work, and a tax exemption for all work carried out for pay lower than an amount to be determined by the Member State.</p>
      <p sl="de">My proposal for a framework statute for spouses or family members helping in family businesses to guarantee their compulsory membership of a social security scheme has also been included, and I am very pleased about that. I am also pleased that we point out that running a family is itself a family business, and that recognising this atypical family work and including it in a social security scheme should be considered. The fact is that besides ordinary black market work, there are millions of Europeans, especially women, who work in family business and are left without any individual social security cover.</p>

      <p sl="de">We have also called on the Council and the Commission today to take further steps towards facilitating and intensifying people-to-people contacts and democratising the country and to consider the possibilities for lowering the cost of visas for Belarusian citizens entering the Schengen territory, which is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming increasingly isolated.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the defeat of democracy in Belarus is particularly painful in the context of the Union's new policy of reconciliation towards that country, following the events in Georgia. Mr Lukashenko failed to recognise the gesture made by Europe and the opportunity to emerge from isolation. The OSCE report states that the elections in Belarus did not meet democratic standards. The new parliament will therefore once again be composed of people subservient to Europe's last dictator. It seems necessary to continue the policy of thawing mutual relations despite these abuses. It must be emphasised, however, that the Union should not be the only one to make concessions. The President of Belarus needs to display clear goodwill as demonstrated by appropriate actions. The pressure on Mr Lukashenko ought to be stepped up, but at the same time benefits should be offered to the people of Belarus, so that Europe's offer is perceived as a better choice than the alternative of forging closer ties with Russia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the successful completion of the negotiations in the framework of the Doha Round seems increasingly unlikely. Mr Mandelson’s resignation from the post of Trade Commissioner is one reason for this. The talks will probably only resume after the start of 2010. The situation is further complicated by the fact that during the next two years elections are due not only in the United States but also in India and in Brazil. This means that the new negotiations will be conducted by a different group of people. For the first time, the European Union is not responsible for the breakdown of the talks. The United States and India are to be blamed for the collapse of the July ministerial talks. According to the experts, however, the main reason for the breakdown was a lack of progress on services and industry.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Should there be a return to the negotiating table, priority must be given to consideration of how to help the poorest countries. At the same time, however, we must not disregard our own interests, notably those of the agricultural sector. Opening up our market unduly would amount to a serious threat to the stability of farm incomes. Many farms could be bankrupted as a result. Should that happen, how would we be able to guarantee the European Union’s food security? Failure to reach agreement on trade issues is an example of how difficult it is to reach a compromise on important matters when such a large number of countries with such varied interests are involved in the talks.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us hope for a more positive outcome to the international negotiations on combating climate change.</p>

      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, once again, it was agriculture that held us up, and, while the EU managed to avoid the blame, I think we have to recognise that we had our own internal politics and that, when Commissioner Mandelson wanted to go further on agriculture, he was held back by some of the most protectionist states in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to recognise that there is a greater goal out here; that services that make up so much of our economy need to be unlocked and liberalised. Unfortunately we have to unlock agriculture and goods before we unlock trade in services.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need further opening of trade. We need to stop protecting uncompetitive farmers.

Just before the vote, however, Mr Duff, a leading Member, ventured to express his surprise that Eastern European countries which have only recently acceded to the Union should be opposed to the introduction of the flag and anthem as compulsory in the European Parliament. I really must explain immediately to Mr Duff that there is ample justification for the simple slogan used during the campaign, indicating that rule from Brussels was no better than rule from Moscow. After all, the ease with which Brussels can introduce and implement changes that infringe European law is in sharp contrast with the difficulty in implementing the principles of solidarity, honesty and non-discrimination. A relevant example is energy policy whereby measures that will ruin Poland’s energy industry were imposed on Poland pursuant to the force of law and in contravention of the aforementioned principles.</p>

Now Parliament is going to adopt them again and even maintain in the text that they must be included in order to give a clear political signal to citizens. What a cynical joke!

However, the point is that first of all it was promised that the outward symbols of a European superstate would not be included in the Treaty of Lisbon, which most Member States have ratified, and now suddenly they are going to be included and enshrined in the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure.

We have to develop water storage and irrigation systems, precipitation reserves have to be maintained in our cities and in the countryside so that we will have water in times of drought.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the decision to approve a general framework laying down the main aspects of the Commission communication on Europe entitled ‘Communicating Europe in Partnership’. It aims to establish a framework for strengthening the wide-ranging communication elements by encompassing them within a broader structure launched by the White Paper on a European communication policy, which advocates a two-way street, characterised by the active participation of citizens and Plan D (‘Plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate’).</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important to recognise that this communication, launched by the Commission following the failure of the draft Constitutional Treaty to encourage discussion of the relations between the Union’s democratic institutions and its citizens, does not appear to have met its objectives. Plan D is a failure: how can there be democracy without dialogue and dialogue without debate? This clearly does little to bridge the enormous gap that has opened up between the citizens, who no longer understand the meaning of European integration, and the institutions, which have become too opaque and incomprehensible. We can only hope that this new attempt to reach an interinstitutional agreement will enable us to move forward.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Accordingly, a majority in Parliament have decided to approve the joint declaration entitled ‘Communicating Europe in Partnership’. In this, three of the EU institutions (Council, European Commission and Parliament) agree on a crusade of propaganda – which, it should be noted, will continue right through the forthcoming European Parliament elections – based on the assumption that the increasing rejection and awareness of the nature of class and the major interests that are behind EU policies, as demonstrated by these referendums, will be overcome by conditioning and controlling the media agenda.</p>

However, there is no change in the basic principles: the point of reference remains the Member State of which the convicted person has nationality; the information is only kept in the central national records and is not directly accessible to the records of the other Member States; the Member States manage and update their own databases.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since 2005 the European Commission has brought forward a range of legislative initiatives aimed at regulating and facilitating the exchange of criminal records in order to do away with a slow and basically inefficient system that operated on the basis of mechanisms laid down in the 1959 Convention of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first improvement was made with the 2005 Council Decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, particularly with regard to shortening transmission times.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In 2007 the Council reached political agreement on a framework decision which aims to ensure that each Member State can respond as fully and correctly as possible to requests for criminal records made to them on their nationals.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The present initiative does not aim to alter the basic principles of that framework decision, but rather to supplement them.

      <p sl="fr">Make no mistake: we are not going to create a super, centralised database. Each Member State will continue to centralise the information on its citizens; each national central administration will be the only body that has access to the interconnection with the other European records.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The national judicial authorities will thus be unable to access the ‘European record’ directly: they will have to send requests for information to their country’s central record, which will act as an intermediary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before now the European records system did not function effectively.

      <p sl="nl">The Romagnoli report deserves our support, because it represents real progress in judicial cooperation between the Member States. In the past there have been too many cases in which the criminal records of serious offenders living in a Member State other than their country of origin have not been passed on to public prosecutors' offices. The Fourniret case in Belgium is the saddest example of that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is a good idea to have a harmonised European criminal records system, provided, of course, that the fundamental rights of everyone are guaranteed. The freedom of expression that is seriously restricted in some Member States by 'anti-racism' laws that impose prison sentences might be a problem in this respect.

      <p sl="pt">We believe that, when necessary, the transmission of information extracted from the criminal records of citizens of one Member State to another Member State must be effected on the basis of (bilateral) cooperation between the parties concerned. However, among other issues whose scope and implications should be assessed, the report imposes obligations on the Member States which fall within the ‘communitisation’ of justice and home affairs to an extent that goes beyond the basis of cooperation between Member States that we recommend.</p>

Such monsters, murderers, louts and thieves cannot hide from justice behind a lack of transparency in the various national databases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For these imperious reasons, we support the establishment of the European Criminal Records Information System insofar as it will guarantee each person’s fundamental freedoms.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on acceleration of the fight against undeclared work as the undeclared work phenomenon is a severe problem throughout the entire Community. The spread of the black labour market is mainly the result of excessive taxation and bureaucracy and leads to a significant decrease in tax revenues and, implicitly, it results in deficient budgets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Moreover, employing staff without complying with the requisite formalities also encourages unfair competition. In this context, besides the increased attention that the authorities should show to reducing taxes on the labour market and to reducing bureaucracy, I would emphasise the need to stimulate the creation of new jobs and to introduce flexible rules for temporary and occasional employment.</p>

Among other things, the rapporteur encourages the Member States to continue with tax and social security system reforms and to take concerted action with a view to combating undeclared work. The rapporteur also proposes a common approach to immigration in the EU and that ‘any reform of economic policies, tax and social protection systems in the Member States by Member States should be integrated and take into account the key causes of undeclared work’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Undeclared work is a complex multi-faceted phenomenon. It encompasses economic, social, institutional and even cultural dimensions, and is detrimental to many entities. The national budget loses income it obviously needs to cover its expenditure. As to the workers in the underground economy themselves, they are often deprived of the rights to which employees are entitled. In addition, these workers are exposed to health and safety risks and have few opportunities for professional development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Undeclared work is also a problem for the internal market. It is detrimental to operation of the latter. The reasons for undeclared work vary across the Member States, and the measures taken to combat it must therefore differ accordingly.

      <p sl="nl">Around 20% of work in Europe is undeclared. That undermines our social security system. It is admitted in this proposal that the market is to some extent corrupt and that that leads to unfair competition. We support action against undeclared work, but we have to abstain from voting because this proposal has serious shortcomings. Unfortunately, it is based on a neo-liberal idea that plays off workers against each other. The fight against undeclared work is used as an excuse to promote the greater flexibility of labour. That puts Europeans in a worse position on the labour market because they are forced to compete with cheap labour from elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007 are having far-reaching effects. The differences in welfare within the EU have increased considerably because in many of the new Member States what used to be successful industries have now collapsed. Those countries now mainly import goods and export labour. People from Poland and Romania go to other countries to work for wages that are not really allowed there, in unacceptable conditions. Advantage is then taken of their low wages to bring down the wages of others. Europe cannot integrate further if we have widely differing levels of income within the EU and those differences are exploited in competition.</p>

      <p sl="el">We are voting against the report because it essentially aims to perpetuate the brutal exploitation of workers. It does not address the problem of undeclared work from the point of view of workers’ interests. Quite the opposite: it is based on the need to maintain the profitability of capital and strengthen the competitiveness of EU monopolies in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. For this reason, instead of measures like inspections and penalties for employers, it proposes incentives for capital such as ‘reducing the non-wage costs’. This reduces or waives the obligation to pay insurance contributions. These are tax exemptions as well; the financial burden on businesses is being reduced and informal employment contracts are being introduced.</p>
      <p sl="el">Such measures not only fail to address the problem of undeclared work, but also give capital complete impunity. There will thus be an increase in this kind of employment, so labour, social and insurance rights will be violated, and the working classes will be ever more exploited.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Undeclared work has become a widespread phenomenon in the European Union. In Denmark, for example, up to 18% of the population undertake work of this nature or have had contact with it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is very often the case that an employee is not penalised in any way for undertaking such work. In general, it is the employer who is penalised. In what could be described as the best case scenario, the employee is required to pay a fine, which is in any case lower than the fine paid by the employer. Theoretically, undeclared work does not constitute grounds to deport a person to their country of origin. Certain countries such as Belgium and Denmark do, however, indicate that this may happen in certain cases such as those involving blatant and persistent violation of the law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union should make every effort to succeed in combating this phenomenon. The most effective approach is to lower taxes and eliminate administrative barriers on the legal labour market, so that undeclared work eventually becomes unprofitable for both parties.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Combating poverty and social exclusion is the main issue on the agenda of the European Union and the Member States. In March 2000, when the Lisbon Strategy began to be implemented, the Council instructed the Member States and the European Commission to take measures to radically reduce poverty, leading to its eradication by 2010. The Member States have demonstrated their determination through their numerous actions at both EU and national level. However, combating poverty and trying to reintegrate people who have been rejected by the labour market remains a hefty task for the enlarged European Union. We will not be able to achieve the goals of the revised Lisbon Strategy if we continue to waste human capital, which is our most precious resource.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Most of the Member States are pursuing a welfare policy as well as an activation policy, seeking to reintegrate people who have been driven out of the labour market. Nevertheless, there is still a large group of people who have little chance of finding employment and who therefore risk finding themselves socially excluded and below the poverty line. Minimum income schemes are the only way for those furthest from the labour market to avoid severe poverty. While performing these vital functions, however, minimum income schemes should encourage the integration into the labour market of those capable of working. The main task, therefore, is to ensure that welfare policy helps to efficiently guarantee the mobilisation of those capable of working as well as achieve a longer-term goal – guaranteeing an acceptable lifestyle for those who are and will remain beyond the labour market.</p>

For someone who is surviving on inadequate welfare benefits, working in a precarious employment relationship or is growing up in a family with a long history of poverty, fine words are not enough. Adequate social protection, individual education and training from an early stage and the motivation to climb out of the poverty spiral by one’s own efforts all play a vital role here.</p>

Of course we do not want any working poor, in other words, people who work very hard for far too little pay.

These services are covered by Ukraine’s commitments as part of its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), with the exception of international maritime transport, which continues to be the subject of a bilateral agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree with the rapporteur that the services area is essential for the EU and Ukrainian economies. I welcome all the efforts made by the European Union to support Ukraine’s efforts to become a member of the World Trade Organisation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We know that the percentage of working poor is increasing as a result of the growth in precarious and poorly paid work.

      <p sl="pt">It is important that this report has been adopted, but it was regrettable that the majority did not allow its debate in plenary. The promotion of social inclusion and the fight against poverty, particularly child poverty in the EU, are uncomfortable issues given that we do not like being faced with the facts. It is said that 20 million people in the EU, mostly women, or around 6% of the total population, are working poor and that 36% of the active population is at risk of falling into the category of working poor. Among the various recommendations made in the report, the European Parliament urges the Member States to reduce child poverty by 50% by 2012 and agree on an EU-wide commitment to end the phenomenon of street children by 2015.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution of 9 October 2008 tabled by six political groups, including the PPE-DE, on the situation in Belarus after the parliamentary elections of 28 September 2008. The statements by President Alexander Lukashenko had given us some hope: he had publicly called for open and democratic elections on 10 July 2008 and had reiterated this call on television on 29 August 2008, promising that the elections would be unprecedented in terms of fairness. It is unacceptable that, in spite of a few minor improvements, the elections of 28 September 2008 fell short of internationally recognised democratic standards, as confirmed by the OSCE Election Observation Mission. For fear of democracy, the last dictator in Europe wasted an opportunity to join the procession of the magnificent and great historical developments that we have witnessed since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of communism.</p>

It is highly regrettable that the elections were not transparent and democratic, for Belarus, for the region and for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the resolution contains several provisions which should not be included. For example, the European Parliament calls on Belarus to abolish the early-voting procedure. It may be true that some electoral fraud occurs through this type of voting, but we still consider that it is up to each sovereign state to decide how the elections will be conducted, as long as they are democratic. There are also ideas on visas, which we consider to be a national matter. It is up to each sovereign state to decide who is permitted to reside in its territory.</p>

If the answer is yes, as we argue, then we need to promote more trade, more transparency, and more clarity and predictability in rules. The impasse in the Doha Round will not benefit either the developed countries or the developing countries. It will not promote more wealth or increase confidence at a time of turbulence in the world economy.

The original EU constitution, which was defeated in referendums in France and the Netherlands, contained references to, among other things, the EU’s national anthem and flag. These were deleted and the EU’s leaders put forward a ‘new’ treaty, the so-called Lisbon Treaty. So now the European Parliament is trying to take revenge and sneak in the use of EU symbols by the back door.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We consider that EU cooperation to liable to meet the same fate as the Esperanto project, the artificial language which never became a world language, but has largely died out. Identity and unity are created by the people, not by an elite.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have therefore voted against this report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The rapporteur, Mr Carnero González, says that it is very questionable whether the recognition of a flag could be an obstacle to ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. He is thereby casting doubt on the impression given by the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr Balkenende. Mr Balkenende maintained in Strasbourg on 23 May 2007 that the EU symbols should not be included in a Constitutional Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">His main reason for doing so was that otherwise the Dutch Council of State would find it necessary to have another Dutch referendum. Mr Carnero González is now proposing that the EU flag, the anthem and the motto should be enshrined in the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. His argument is that this sends a political signal that these symbols represent European values. He expects the EU to be a benchmark for freedom, development and solidarity in the world. The EU is also characterised at least as much by out-of-control ambition, annoying interference, risky pressure towards economic freedom and a military show of strength.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is better if Europe gains a clearer identity by 'listening to the voters'. This policy of symbols does not change anything. The blue flag is already on all the bank notes and car number plates. We are still acting as though the Treaty of Lisbon is viable, whereas it has been rejected according to its own rules.</p>

      <p sl="de">In their referenda in 2005, the French and Dutch people rejected the EU Constitution, and yet in a classic case of EU obduracy, an attempt has now been made to give the whole project a fresh veneer by dropping the EU symbols and repackaging this failed but almost identical project as the Lisbon Treaty. If the EU persists in this attempt to revive the original Treaty by introducing just one real amendment, namely jettisoning the EU symbols, the EU will forfeit what remains of its credibility.

      <p sl="it">Excluding the symbols from the Treaty was the umpteenth act distancing the European institutions from the citizens.

      <p sl="sk">Since their formation, the European Communities and subsequently the European Union have sought to have symbols that the public can easily identify. The process of ratification of the Constitutional Treaty was wrecked due to unsuccessful referenda in France and the Netherlands. The Lisbon Treaty, which was born from a compromise and replaced the text of the Constitutional Treaty, did not adopt the symbols because of the pressure from some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The public is used to each organisation having its logo. Flags, emblems, anthems, slogans, colours and other types of symbol convey an emotional image of the underlying values of the organisations they represent.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This experience, which is shared by our countries, regions, churches, parties, civil organisations, etc., is also valid at EU level. The flag showing a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background always fascinates me. When I arrive in Slovakia and see the flag flying from buildings, I feel happy because Slovakia belongs to the common European house. It would be hard to find such a well-known piece of music and poetry that would better symbolise the idea of European integration than the anthem of the European Union from Ludwig van Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Even though the single currency is not yet used by all the Member States, third countries in particular are starting to identify the EU with the euro in the same way as they identify the US with the dollar.

      <p sl="cs">With regard to the report on the use of the symbols of the Union, I can only say that this is a further illustration of the way in which democratic procedures are sidestepped in the European Union. Some time ago, the symbols of the Union collapsed when the proposal for the so-called European Constitution was rejected. The Constitution, or at least its pivotal context, is supposed to be de facto ‘resuscitated’ by the Lisbon Treaty, and now the European Parliament is trying to resuscitate the symbols of the Union. I cannot but ask what the European bodies and institutions intend to do in cases of misuse of these symbols?

This report makes us aware that the EU wastes 20% of water due to inefficiency; there is a lack of awareness among the public for promoting water saving and 17% of the EU region suffers from severe water shortage. In response, the EU needs to take a holistic approach with precise measures for better water management and supply.</p>

      <p sl="el">A smattering of fine words cannot hide the anti-popular nature of the proposals in the report, whose main thrust is the reactionary idea of ‘demand-based water management’. The report concludes by highlighting a range of measures essentially confined to raising the price of water and the cost of supplying it. Yet another weighty levy is being imposed on the masses and on poor and medium-scale farmers because water is being completely commercialised. The aim is also to increase the profitability of monopoly business groups.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Clearly, water losses, river basin planning, re-use of ‘grey water’, exchange between states and the gradual establishment of an Observatory seem to be concerns or proposals which are full of apparent good intentions. However, these are not apparent in the scheme established by the Framework Water Directive, which calls for the application of economic and financial principles to water management, without safeguarding its main conditions: its enshrinement as a right and its democratic management.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Concerns have also been raised which should be taken into account, even though they question EU policy.

      <p sl="it">Water is a finite resource. Safeguarding our ecosystems, water resources, drinking and bathing water is the key to protecting the environment. That is why joint action at European level will ensure that we manage this precious resource in the best possible way.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, I would like to compliment Mr Seeber on his work. He has drawn attention to the main issues that the Union should confront: extensive water consumption and the resulting wastage of water, ignorance and a lack of awareness of the problem, as well as the absence of a common European approach.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The problem of water scarcity and drought is now critical, as are the related consequences of global warming. There has been a dramatic increase in cases of extreme drought and water scarcity in recent decades. This is largely due to inefficient water management and overuse of water for agricultural purposes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union is itself facing serious threats as a result of climate change and human activity. Over one third of Europeans are already living in areas affected by water scarcity. Unless appropriate action is taken immediately to ensure more rational and sustainable use of water, we must assume that more people will be affected by water scarcity in the future. In addition, the predicted population increase from six to nine billion by 2050 will lead to even greater demand for water.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Some experts are beginning to compare water to oil. The era of cheap and relatively easily accessible water is over. Water scarcity in the agricultural sector should be dealt with by developing water retention installations and improving irrigation. In addition, a specific culture of responsible water saving should be developed through an active awareness-raising policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Each one of us should begin to save water and use it sensibly. It is also essential to implement technology to prevent water from being wasted and to raise social awareness of this problem. A more integrated approach to the problems relating to water and drought is needed, too.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution tabled by five political groups, including the PPE-DE, on Arctic governance. During the 20th century Arctic air temperatures increased by approximately 5°C, which is ten times faster than the observed global mean surface temperature. Indeed, an additional warming of about 4-7°C in the Arctic is predicted for the next 100 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I strongly support the statement that the time for diagnosis is over and the time for action is now. Moreover, the EU counts amongst its Member States three Arctic nations, and amongst its closely related neighbours participating in the internal market through the Agreement creating the European Economic Area (EEA) a further two Arctic nations, meaning that the EU and its associated states comprise more than half the numeric membership of the Arctic Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Spanish colleague Alejandro Cercas (PSE, ES) on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport. I agree that it is regrettable that considerable differences still remain in the application and enforcement of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must urge the Member States to step up their efforts to guarantee efficient and uniform implementation of the social provisions and to transpose Directive 2002/15/EC on the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities so as to ensure the road safety of citizens and the health and safety of drivers and to provide a clear framework of fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission must display the utmost firmness in dealing with infringements of Community law by Member States as regards social provisions in the road transport sector, provide for coercive measures in the event of failure to comply with provisions and take preventive measures, if necessary via judicial process, to ensure strict compliance with Community law. This is essential in order to ensure fair and undistorted competition.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this report due to the pressing need for the Member States to transpose social legislation and to ensure it is duly enforced. The health and well-being of freight transport drivers as well as the safety of other road users depend on clear rules concerning issues such as working time, driving hours and periods of rest, as well as on effective inspections and penalties for non-compliance.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is thus very important that Member States speed up the transposition of Directive 2002/15/EC, and also that the European Parliament assert the support for the inclusion of all road transport drivers within the working time legislation applicable in this field, regardless of their employment status. I can see no reason why self-employed drivers should be exempt from measures which contribute to the safety of our roads.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU’s social legislation in the area of road transport is of great importance. Road transport is of vital economic importance across the Union. It is also important, however, that social legislation be applied in order to protect both drivers and the public at large. There are anomalies in the existing legislation and there have been shortcomings in national transposition. Accordingly I voted in favour of the Cercas report.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Road transport is one of the economic areas that plays a very important role in the European internal market. This area is especially important with regard to employment, as more than 3 million people work in the EU transport industry. Despite an abundance of EU legislation aiming to ensure the road safety of European citizens and the health and safety of passenger and freight transport drivers, cases of breaches of the rules on rest periods and breaks are on the increase in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="lv">This situation has two main causes: the failure of Member States to transpose legislation on road transport into national legislation, or to do so diligently. The health and safety requirements applied to drivers with an employment contract differ from those applied to drivers who are self-employed. The present situation, where legislation on working time is applied only to those with work contracts and not to the self-employed, threatens to distort competition in the transport industry. The number of fictitious self-employed drivers is increasing, as health and safety requirements for self-employed drivers are less stringent. This situation not only encourages unfair competition, but also endangers the health and safety of drivers and other road users. The European Commission aims to ensure that self-employed drivers comply with the same rules laid down in the relevant legislation.</p>
      <p sl="lv">These measures would enable us to achieve much better levels of road safety and to ensure appropriate health and safety conditions for drivers as well as fair competition in the road transport sector.</p>

      <p sl="nl">This proposal is an attempt to take earlier decisions seriously through better controls, better information, secured parking places on motorways and the abolition from 23 March 2009 of exemptions for self-employed workers. The transposition and implementation of social legislation on road transport in national law is hopelessly behind.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The four Member States that fall short in that respect are protected as long as they are not named openly. The fact that they do not regulate working and driving times and rest periods is bad for road safety and for the welfare of professional drivers. My party, the SP, is supporting the plan to do something about this, although better proposals have already been rejected in earlier votes. We are doing that because we believe that it is important to comply with social legislation and because self-employed drivers are also to be covered by the Directive. That will put a stop to the abuse of employers forcing their workers to become self-employed and not on the staff.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Being falsely classified as self-employed, they have worse working conditions and have to take on impossible business risks. The competition in that sector is fierce. The talk about complying with the rules has to be turned into action. Only then can drivers still earn enough and make a secure living.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The legislation addressed by Alejandro Cercas is not uncontroversial. I think everyone agrees that it is in the interests of both lorry drivers and the public that large, heavy vehicles are not driven by people who suffer from a serious lack of sleep. Rules are obviously necessary in this area. At the same time, we must realise that the lorry strike which broke out on the Oresund Bridge in November 2007 did not happen by chance. The rules on working time which the EU has produced in many branches of the profession have been much criticised, by both employers and employees. It might therefore be more appropriate to ask the Commission to undertake an impact assessment to examine how the legislation has worked and been received, rather than calling for even more stringent implementation. This kind of legislation requires considerable flexibility in order to be able to work in, say, both Romania and Denmark. I therefore abstained in the vote.</p>

There is therefore an urgent need to adopt firmer measures in the field of prevention through the widespread introduction of health impact assessments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fight against the counterfeiting of medicines must be a priority. I regret that the Commission has not examined in detail the problems affecting health professionals, who must be at the heart of any health policy. I agree with the rapporteur that one of the priority goals in the health sector should be a reduction in health inequalities and inequities. I am in favour of a modern approach to health promotion and protection, particularly for the most vulnerable sections of the population, such as young children, and the introduction of integrated social and health policies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of the Peterle report on the health strategy for 2008-2013 because I believe that ensuring a high level of lifelong human health protection must be an EU priority.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would reiterate the recommendations made in this report, particularly the proposals that I made, which highlight the importance of developing prevention plans and healthy lifestyle promotion actions throughout the EU and carrying out screening programmes to facilitate the early detection and immediate treatment of disease, thereby reducing the associated mortality and morbidity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also highlight the need to improve the quality of healthcare and assistance provided to citizens, bearing in mind the increased prevalence of chronic diseases and the increasing ageing of the European population.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I fully support the report by Mr Peterle. I believe that it is a good follow-up to the priorities of the Slovenian Presidency. The latter gave high priority to health issues, which is entirely understandable, as health is the greatest gift a human being can be blessed with during his or her lifetime. Unfortunately, certain worrying health trends have emerged in Europe. These include an increase in the number of cases of cancer as well as the number of cases of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. In addition, we need to tackle new challenges linked to the ageing of the population, climate change, globalisation and even the consequences of terrorism in terms of the threat of biological terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There are marked inequalities between the healthcare systems of the Member States, however. This is particularly true as regards access to healthcare, prevention, detection and effective treatment of certain diseases. The result is significant differences in the life expectancy of Europeans. A study of the health map of Europe leads one to the sad conclusion that, in a sense, the Iron Curtain is still with us. The current divide is based on health.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must improve methods of cooperation in this area if we wish to remedy the situation. We must also improve the effectiveness of our actions and exploit all of Europe's so-called medical potential. I support the rapporteur's call for investment in healthcare systems to be increased. I believe that funds invested in healthcare are not an expense as such. Instead, they are a vital element of investment in the quality of human capital. The health of EU citizens must be perceived as one of the key social and political factors that will determine the Union’s future.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the Peterle report on the EU’s health strategy. The report acknowledges that the provision of health care is a Member State matter and I strongly believe that this should remain the case. There are elements in this Parliament and in the EU as a whole who believe that health care should be fully opened up to the fluctuations of the free market, and I wholly reject such notions. However the EU does have an important role to play in the exchange of information and in the promotion of health lifestyles. The Commission must now come forward with concrete proposals for Europe-wide action in health promotion, whilst safeguarding individual Member States’ rights to take their own decisions as to the delivery of health services.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Access to health care is a right of all EU citizens and providing equal access for all to high-quality medical services is a core task of the Member States’ public authorities.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I support this document and agree that it covers the most acute health-care problems. Undoubtedly, both at EU level and in the individual Member States, we should concentrate more on long-term health protection. This is particularly important in the case of the elderly and people with physical or mental disabilities and home-based health care.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In view of the shortage of carers and the appreciation of the importance of the services they provide, it is necessary to improve their working conditions as well as ensure that carers receive high-quality training. The Member States should respond to the European Parliament’s call to guarantee patients access to lifesaving drugs, even if they are expensive, in order to guarantee the universal right to health.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The Member States should implement the EU’s health strategy without delay. This would encourage and facilitate the provision of international health-care services, the free movement of health-care professionals and patients as well as strengthen cooperation between private and public bodies. Most importantly, with the implementation of the EU’s health strategy, people throughout the EU would have access to quality health care.</p>

      <p sl="sk">At present, major differences in health still exist between individual EU Member States. According to Eurostat, life expectancy at birth varies among EU countries by 9 years for women and 13 years for men, and infant mortality rates vary sixfold. In the light of this, I sincerely welcome the efforts made by Mr Peterle, who in his report refers to the need to reduce these inequalities. Since as much as 40% of diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles and up to a third of cancers are preventable through early diagnosis, I feel that the remarks about the importance of prevention are particularly valuable.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I agree that since the area of disease prevention still attracts only 3% of health budgets, more funds should be made available from these budgets. By raising public awareness about the importance of prevention and a healthy lifestyle we can eventually lower healthcare costs since it is cheaper to prevent diseases than subsequently treat them. I firmly believe that the countries must take steps to improve healthcare, and in that context the Commission’s White Paper and the Council Conclusions of December 2007 provide an appropriate foundation.</p>

      <p sl="de">In Germany, between 20 and 30 clinics annually are being forced to close because doctors are being driven into insolvency by claims for damages for supposedly prescribing drugs which are too expensive, and entire swathes of the country are at severe risk of healthcare under-provision. These are just some of the outcomes of the insane health policies pursued in recent years. Nor is the scenario more encouraging elsewhere in Europe. It is not just that healthcare financing is precarious, to say the least: doctors and nursing staff are being forced to spend more and more time shackled to their desks, dealing with red tape, instead of performing their actual task of healthcare delivery.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need a radical rethink on an EU scale. What we need, for example, are sound strategies to ensure an adequate supply of doctors, together with best practice examples. However, we also need to address fundamental problems such as the falling birth rate among Europe’s indigenous population by providing better incentives. We also need models to encourage healthy lifestyles. Prevention is just one small piece in the healthcare puzzle. That is why I abstained in the vote.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Health is one of the things people value most in their lives. Consequently, I welcome the Commission’s health strategy entitled ‘Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’. I voted for the report by Mr Alojz Peterle, who based his report on three keywords: cooperation, differences and prevention.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Although, in accordance with the principle of solidarity, healthcare falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States, there is nothing to prevent healthcare from being given a European dimension on the basis of cooperation. All Member States can benefit from mutual exchanges of their know-how within the framework of best practice. If one EU Member State can successfully treat a patient for cancer, citizens from all corners of the EU should have an equal chance to make use of this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Major inequities in health exist between and within the Member States. As far as cancer is concerned, the differences in survival rates between the new and old Member States are such that we can talk about an ‘Iron Curtain in health’. A key strategic breakthrough is needed in the area of disease prevention. Consequently, the long-term planning of preventive measures should be a starting point.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Investment in cancer research in Europe represents only one fifth of the funds it receives in the US. We must invest a great deal more in health than we have done to date, and consistently incorporate health in policies at all levels.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report in the conviction that putting the recommendations into practice will boost life expectancy in the European Union and help us achieve the Lisbon objectives related to economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report reveals the vital link between poor application of Community environmental legislation and the adverse consequences on citizens’ quality of life.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The battle to reduce the effects of climate change on the population’s health must also be supported by active policies aimed at adapting to climate change. One example in this regard is the development of methodologies for forecasting and preventing major health problems which may appear, depending on the severity of the effects of climate changes, while also bearing in mind socio-economic conditions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Efforts need to be stepped up in order to meet the objective proposed by the Commission in 2005 of achieving a 40% reduction in the number of deaths caused by air pollution by 2020. The studies carried out have demonstrated that two out of five deaths worldwide are directly or indirectly linked to environmental factors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The White Paper on health in the European Union raises many important questions about the future of Europe and, in particular, about the paradigmatic changes that will affect how our societies operate in the future. I therefore agree with Mr Peterle when he draws attention to the aspects connected with these new challenges, such as ageing of the population, climate change, globalisation and mobility. These must form the foundations of the new policies because they are what will bring fundamental social and economic change. However, we must also take into account the current health problems which are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and cancer. Prevention policies are therefore becoming increasingly important and we must establish a clear framework for the current circumstances, bearing in mind the situation in the 27 Member States and taking account of existing inequalities between social groups and between Member States, so that we can adopt cross-sectoral health policies which will create the conditions for the effective development of health policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of the report entitled ‘Together for Health : a Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’. This strategy is a specific response to the European Commission's White Paper on health policy for the period 2008-2013. The main provisions of the White Paper involve promoting a healthy lifestyle and eliminating the barriers to access to healthcare services in the EU Member States. Protecting the citizens against health risks, ensuring balanced healthcare systems and introducing new technologies in this area are also highlighted. I believe that health promotion strategies should place strong emphasis on the prevention and early detection of diseases.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Certain worrying health trends have become evident recently. These include an increase in cases of cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Only 3% of healthcare budgets is currently allocated to prevention, however, even though it is well known that prevention is better than cure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The battle against the diseases of modern civilisation will only be won if we provide the citizens with appropriate healthcare and treatment. In addition, we must combat the inequalities in access to healthcare services by individual social groups and reduce the differences between the Member States in terms of access to healthcare. Efforts to ensure health and safety in the workplace are also very important. In addition, more should be done to better adjust healthcare to patients’ needs.</p>

      <p sl="el">Public health and its commercialisation are being targeted by the EU. The aim is to multiply capitalist profit by downgrading public structures, which are being limited to high-cost sectors unprofitable for private operators.</p>
      <p sl="el">The EU is treating health as a means of increasing workers’ productivity and reducing social costs. It is intervening in a sector that is exclusively under the authority of the Member States, applying private enterprise criteria, promoting entrepreneurial activity and neglecting the basic human right to health and life. At the same time, the EU is using health as a pretext to promote its expansionist, imperialist plans by proposing the involvement of health services in the CFSP, international trade and relations with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Community framework for health services and management of innovation in health systems, and the creation of European centres of excellence and other proposed measures, are the just the first step towards concentrating health services in the hands of a few multinationals. These will do business with private insurance companies to decide on the services provided on the basis of an unacceptable system of class discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are voting against the report because we align ourselves with the workers’ struggle against the commercialisation and privatisation of health. We support the fight for a free public health system with high-quality services that fully cover the needs of ordinary families.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am in favour of adoption of the report on the European Union’s healthcare strategy for the years 2008-2013. The sums allocated to disease prevention in healthcare budgets are too low. They represent barely 3% of resources.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are increasingly aware of an increase in diseases related to contemporary civilisation. These include cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Such conditions are mainly due to poor eating habits and an unhealthy lifestyle. Prevention, perhaps through information campaigns, would be much cheaper for the budgets of healthcare services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another issue concerns the conditions of treatment. These vary considerably across the territory of the European Union, ranging from very high standards in the countries of the so-called old Union to much lower ones in the countries that acceded more recently. This is manifested, for example, in higher infant mortality and shorter life expectancy for both men and women.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union should take steps to ensure equal conditions for treatment across all Member States. Healthcare policy should be a priority for the Union.</p>
