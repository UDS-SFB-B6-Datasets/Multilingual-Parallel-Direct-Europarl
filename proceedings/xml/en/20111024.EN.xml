      <p sl="unknown">I would like to make a few initial remarks. We have before us a week of decisions that will be crucial for Europe. Yesterday, I attended the European Council meeting. Wednesday will see the end of the summit of the Euro Group states and the European Council. The members of the Euro Group will have to make decisions that assuage both the markets and the public. On Thursday morning in Strasbourg, Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso will present the European Council conclusions. There will be a very important debate on Thursday at 10.00.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Also on the agenda at this part-session will be tomorrow’s debate on the European Semester and Wednesday’s vote on the budget. We want the budget for 2012 to be a budget of investment, economic growth and job creation. I would like to express my appreciation at this point to fellow Members who attended the conference on the new multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. Please remember that this was a European Parliament initiative; it was our idea. The conference was a success and it has been suggested that it should be continued in six months and a year. I would like to stress once again that thirty-something representatives of the European Parliament were present for the entire talks, which meant that we made our presence felt and were a very important voice with regard to the main subject matter of the discussion.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The next point: yesterday, the people of Tunisia voted in their country’s first free and democratic elections. This was an historic moment for Tunisia and the entire Arab world. There was a turnout of over 90% and, according to reports and information we have received, voting was conducted peacefully and in a responsible manner. We extend our best wishes to the new parliament and future government. The election was monitored on site by European Parliament observers, and we will receive their report in the next few days. I will be visiting Tunisia personally on Sunday, and this will already be the second time I have been in the country since the Arab Spring began. All of us at the European Parliament consider North Africa today to be a crucial place for the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Another of our southern neighbours, Libya, can now embark fully on the road towards democracy and establish a provisional government. The country’s new political system will have to be based on the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms for all citizens. This Saturday, I will also be travelling to Libya to meet with our partners and discuss the most pressing issues. It gives me great satisfaction to be going there, to a country that is now truly free, and whose people have, after all, suffered so much for more than four decades of dictatorship under Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Another item of information is that last week, we received good news for Spain and all its people. The declaration made by the terrorist organisation ETA of a complete end to armed activity means that ETA has to voluntarily disband and all of its members have to lay down their arms. A great deal of respect is due for the many years of effort on the part of all of Spain’s democratic institutions and law and order authorities in combating terrorism. Democracy has once again prevailed over terrorism in this long-term and long-lasting battle. We also express our solidarity with the families of the 829 people who have been killed over more than 40 years of ETA’s terrorist activities.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We are receiving tragic news from Turkey, where more than 200 people were killed in the earthquake that hit the country on Sunday. On behalf of the European Parliament, I send my condolences to the families of those killed. I would like to ask all of you to rise to observe a minute’s silence for the victims of the earthquake in Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">[Tuesday]:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I have received a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for a new item, Council and Commission statements on the state of play of the negotiations of the European Council concerning the economic crisis, to be added to tomorrow’s agenda at 15.00.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I feel – and we have also tried to agree this quickly among the group chairs – that, following this sombre weekend in Brussels, Parliament cannot bow out of the debate on a solution to the crisis and that we should not wait to see whether or not we are informed on Thursday, but that we must urgently intervene once more.</p>
      <p sl="de">I spent the entire weekend in Brussels and tried to follow every phase of the decisions – and I find it bizarre that a summit that was postponed for fourteen days was unable to make basic decisions. Apparently, the more crisis summits we have, the less able we are to agree. The deeper the crisis is described and analysed, the deeper the political crisis becomes between the Heads of State or Government during the crisis summits.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament’s position is very clear. It is important that we keep reiterating this position to the citizens of the European Union. European economic governance is a different thing entirely to these crisis summits.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I believe that we should issue a statement ahead of this summit as part of an urgent and topical debate tomorrow afternoon.</p>

I would like to suggest that we proceed as follows: to save time, we could arrange a round of group spokespeople so that the groups can say quite clearly what this is about, which would allow Parliament to send a clear message to the Council. That is something which I would support.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my point concerns Tuesday’s order of business. The order of business includes an oral question on the Maternity Leave Directive. I am very surprised, because we adopted our report on this issue at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are in the middle of the ordinary legislative procedure. During the ordinary legislative procedure, one does not submit to the Council questions in which one goes so far as to make concessions regarding the report we have adopted. I believe that we should not include this oral question in the order of business. If we do include it, we are showing the Council that we have completely failed to understand the ordinary legislative procedure and the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Ádám Kósa, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 [2010/2272(INI) ] (A7-0263/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="1-028-000" speaker_id="96829" name="Ádám Kósa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been mentioned many times within the walls of the European Parliament building that there are around 80 million people living with disabilities in the European Union. Political decision makers have so far failed to devote the necessary attention to and care for this extremely large social group. These are regrettable facts which have been stressed by the European Parliament on several occasions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I think we have reached a turning point in the history of the European Union. The Spanish, Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies, together with the European Commission, have made disability a matter of priority which has several links with various policies. Let me just say that this was due for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is why it is an honour for me, as a deaf MEP, to be the rapporteur for this report. It has also been an honour for me to receive all the help and support from the shadow rapporteurs in this enormous task.</p>
      <p sl="hu">And it has also been an honour to receive around 400 amendment proposals, as well as various opinions from three other committees. These amendments and opinions have been incorporated into what is now the full and final text of the report.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The only objective that I was guided by when preparing my report was to come up with a realistic and feasible position at the time of the economic crisis, one that feels tangible for people with disabilities, reflects the European Parliament’s strong commitment towards people with disabilities, improves the situation of disabled people, and also prompts the European Commission’s active involvement.</p>
      <p sl="hu">From the several proposals received, let me highlight two: one is a key element of the European Commission’s proposed strategy, the European Accessibility Act, for which the report has great expectations, because it proposes the development of a controllable mechanism. The other is the expected progress in the area of info-communication accessibility.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On the other hand, the report also redefines the role of the European Parliament, which we stress, so that the UN Convention on the rights of people with disabilities can receive greater emphasis in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We have high expectations for the proposal that calls for the establishment of a European Disability Board. Let me also stress that a substantial part of the report is based on compromises.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We received different proposals, of which progressive proposals have been incorporated into the report. This resulted in the inclusion of various aids or other progressive parts in the report, such as the call to recognise sign languages.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to urge the European Commission and Member State governments to be proactive and enable the social inclusion of people with disabilities as soon as possible, so that they can become active citizens of the European Union. This would be an incredible opportunity for 80 million people.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One thing is certain: since the Lisbon Treaty, people with disabilities are no longer classed as second class citizens on paper. However, it is now time to turn this into practice, to make sure that all citizens are equal.</p>

    <intervention id="1-029-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, allow me first of all to congratulate you, and the rapporteur, Mr Kósa, on your report on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this report, the European Parliament is once again demonstrating its long-standing commitment to ensuring that equality and inclusion become a reality for the 80 million or so disabled people living in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Disability-related issues have entered the legal and legislative domain. On 22 January, for the first time in its history, the European Union became a signatory to an international human rights treaty: the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which has entered into force in the European Union. That important step for the rights of disabled people may well have been taken, but it was the European Parliament’s unfailing support throughout the complex procedure that also led to the conclusion of that Convention. Your April 2009 legislative resolution sent a strong political message in this regard and helped pave the way for a unanimous agreement among the Member States in the Council. The Commission is committed to making the rights enshrined in the Convention a reality, in cooperation with the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the European Disability Strategy, I am anxious to reassure you that the emphasis placed today on an approach based on human rights and on citizen-focused disability policies is far from being a simple semantic change. It is based on very practical measures, which are also explained in detail in the European Disability Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The overall aim of this strategy is to enable disabled people to exercise all of their rights and to participate fully in all aspects of social and economic life, as individuals, consumers, students, workers and political actors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our strategy focuses, first and foremost, on removing obstacles. It provides the means to implement the United Nations Convention at EU level through the adoption of an ambitious programme of action. Although aspects of everyday life, such as education, health care and employment, are chiefly the responsibility of the Member States, we are convinced that EU-wide action is needed to support and complement the efforts made at national level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are going to use the Europe 2020 strategy and its instruments to encourage the full economic and social participation of disabled people. Through this integration-based approach, we will ensure that disabled people are not excluded from any action whatsoever. Rest assured that we will be monitoring very closely the measures taken by the Member States to improve the employment situation of these people. We will learn about these measures via the reports on the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, submitted as part of the annual national reform programmes; the issue of disabled persons is included in these reform programmes and in the reports that the Member States will have to provide to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased to announce that the Commission will be making our recovery from the crisis the dominant theme of the conference held to mark the European Day of People with Disabilities. The conference will focus, in particular, on the contribution of the flagship initiatives under the Europe 2020 strategy and on funding to promote inclusive growth as guaranteed by the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the European legislative act on accessibility, in June, the Council declared itself broadly in favour of the European Disability Strategy and called on the Commission to review the framework currently in place to guarantee accessibility. This issue is at the heart of the strategy, and the adoption of a European legislative act on accessibility is one of the agreed priority actions in this area. Accessibility means enabling any person with disabilities to enjoy the same access as everyone else, whether it be access to his or her physical environment, to transport, to information or to communication. Accessibility is an essential precondition for enabling such persons to exercise their right as recognised by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the United Nations Convention. The studies and complaints received from the public indicate that access to goods and services is still insufficient on the European market. What is more, accessible goods and services are often expensive; this situation is clearly due to the fact that it is a limited market in which there is still little competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These deficiencies are obstacles preventing disabled people from participating in the economic, social and political life of our society. Given our ageing population, there is clearly a potential market for highly accessible goods and services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Businesses often seem to ignore the economic potential of disabled people as consumers. Many Member States have sought to improve accessibility by drafting national guidelines and standards in order to meet the obligations laid down in the United Nations Convention. However, if we settle for providing purely national responses to the issue of the lack of accessibility, the 27 Member States will each end up with different legislation, regulations, standards and technical requirements, meaning that we will ultimately have a fragmented market that offers very little in the way of competition. We are convinced that a European market in accessible goods and services would hold far greater appeal for businesses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The adoption of a European legislative act on accessibility should aim to encourage economies of scale for accessible goods and services, to fill the gaps in the market, and to increase competition. The European Commission plans to present a proposal for a European legislative act on accessibility in autumn 2012. The many issues relating to this initiative and to its content, scope and legal form are currently being examined. The preparation process has, in fact, begun and will be supported by a substantial impact assessment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would like to receive contributions from everyone concerned but, naturally, we would like to obtain the opinions of disabled people and the organisations that represent them as a priority. It goes without saying that we are also very interested in the opinions of businesses, service providers and public authorities in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also hope that you will see fit to participate in this process, and we invite you to give us your thoughts on this issue so that these legislative acts may be drafted properly.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It is crucial for the European Union to have a disability strategy in order to help create a sustainable, competitive and innovative society by developing smart and inclusive growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union and its individual Member States must make a commitment to ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and implementing the strategy in its entirety. They must guarantee freedom of communication for all by giving official recognition to Braille and sign language, and guarantee freedom of movement by removing architectural barriers, incorporating dedicated transport services into the public transport system and introducing a unified passengers’ charter.</p>
      <p sl="it">In health terms, it is important to remove inequalities and ensure that everyone is provided with at least a minimum level of care and adequate rehabilitation services based on their desire for autonomy. Young people must be given effective support to enable them to take part in social and civic life, lifelong learning and the world of work through the introduction of specific quotas and measures to adapt jobs to the needs of job-seekers with disabilities. Lastly, citizens who are able-bodied to varying degrees must also be regarded as a resource and not a burden.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Ádám Kósa for his excellent report. I, too, would like to highlight a few ideas from the report and opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM).</p>
      <p sl="hu">Firstly, women living with disabilities face multiple discrimination. In this respect, I fully agree with Mr Kósa’s opinion, that there is a long journey from de jure to de facto equality.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Secondly, there are three groups of women who are more exposed to the risk of poverty: single mothers with disabilities, mothers of disabled children in two-parent or broken families, and elderly women with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">My third remark, therefore, is about inclusion, which is of the utmost importance, and national strategies should also take into account that we have groups of people with various disabilities living among us who have different needs. We have high expectations for these strategies in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we on the Petitions Committee are well aware of concerns about this issue because of the many submissions and petitions we receive on the subject. All those who have full enjoyment of their faculties may be forgiven for easily forgetting or not realising the difficulties faced by people with disabilities. I learnt this lesson myself when I faced the loss of sight in one eye because of a detached retina. That was relatively easily fixed and I was very fortunate, whereas many millions are not so fortunate because they have permanent disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our opinion is about encouraging good practice, but we must all be aware of the challenge we face in delivering promises and therefore be wary of raising hopes that we may not be able to afford in these difficult economic times.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to warmly congratulate my colleague, Mr Kósa, on his excellent report. It tables concrete measures to enable disabled people to participate actively in society. The figures say it all: there are around 80 million disabled Europeans and only 30-40% have a job or are able to work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This rate of employment is very low, which exacerbates the risk that they will become victims of poverty and social exclusion. There still remains much to be done as regards increasing the employment of disabled people and eliminating discrimination against them. Participation in working life and economic independence are essential factors in social integration. As such, the Member States should remove the barriers to accessing jobs and facilitate mobility in all areas of life.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The purpose of these measures to be adopted by the Member States should be to improve everyone’s quality of life, in a society in which it is possible to work more effectively and under better conditions. As such, the very important role of education and training systems, which must be sufficiently primed to meet the needs of disabled people in the best way possible, is of particular importance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to conclude by calling for the European Disability Strategy to be properly implemented in all the Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="1-034-000" speaker_id="96681" name="Vilija Blinkevičiūtė" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work overall and for drawing up the report which focuses on increasing the mobility of people with disabilities, by eliminating physical and social hindrances for the disabled when using public buildings and public services. I would like to draw attention to the fact that, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have decided to call on the Member States to approve the proposal for an anti-discrimination directive as soon as possible. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats calls on us to comply with the agreed compromise and vote for all the European Union Member States, the Presidency and the Commission to work as much as possible on the Anti-Discrimination Directive, which stalled a long time ago, and find possible solutions so that this directive moves forward, is adopted and enters into force throughout the European Union as soon as possible, because this would indeed greatly improve the situation facing disabled people.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Secondly, although the report discusses employment for people with disabilities, there needs to be an even greater focus on guaranteeing education and vocational training opportunities and providing the required help for disabled people in the workplace. I would like to underline the fact that the high level of unemployment is the greatest obstacle to the inclusion of disabled people in society, and that unemployment among disabled people arises because of insufficient preparation for the labour market. Many schools and vocational training institutions lack trained specialists and suitable training programmes for disabled people and, in the end, training institutions are not physically adapted to the needs of disabled children and young people. Thus, the education system’s approach to disabled children and young people is still inadequate, and absence from school leads to significant social and employment disadvantages, and consequently poverty, particularly during the present economic crisis. The Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament must therefore work together to ensure that the lives of disabled people and their families really do change, not just in words but in deeds. Today, I am sad to say that I do not see representatives of the Presidency in the House.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank the rapporteur, Mr Kósa, who has been as tireless as ever. This report begins by citing 40 or so official reference documents, including United Nations conventions, communications from the European Parliament and the Commission, resolutions, green papers and miscellaneous acts, which makes one realise just how much work has been carried out over the years on legislation, regulations, guidelines and recommendations in the field of disability.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, this report puts forward a long list of objectives to further the inclusion of our fellow citizens with disabilities. I would like to mention two of these objectives in particular. The first is the participation of people with disabilities in the decision-making process, based on the principle of ‘nothing about us without us’. The second objective is to regard this subject as a human and civil rights issue, in other words, not an issue about a single group of people, but one that touches on the very identity of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reality in Europe is very different, however, Mr President, because sadly, we are witnessing an increase in the suffering and pain of people with disabilities in our countries. We see structural funds that should be available but are shamefully left unused by Member States or local authorities, and we see infringements by these same Member States or local authorities that are not punished as they should be by the Commission. We see good practice in some countries, but unfortunately, it is ignored and not exported or valued elsewhere, and we see treatment that varies from one country to another or from one region to another within the same country, which limits considerably the freedom of movement of our fellow citizens with disabilities.</p>

We are told that the current economic crisis has had a disproportionately negative impact on people from marginalised groups: unemployment rates for Europe’s 80 million people with disabilities are twice as high as those for people without. Thus, the issue needs to be addressed with some urgency, but I cannot agree with the Commissioner that this can only be achieved at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much support the direction of this report but believe that it goes too far in calling for unnecessary initiatives at supranational level. We should not use the current crisis as a reason for increasing bureaucracy and red tape. In this report, we call for, among other things, the creation of a European disability board, but without any clear setting-out of what such a board should do, other than that it should meet regularly. The calls on Member States to adopt legal and financial measures to support the employment of disabled people and the call for detailed measures on institutional care and provision of housing benefits stray well into Member States’ territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would be happy with a statement of general principles, but this report is far too detailed and prescriptive and risks creating a tangled bureaucracy where simplicity would be a better remedy. Initiatives for increasing the employment opportunities for those with disabilities must come from Member States, each able to adapt to its own national traditions and social customs. Legislation which tries to help everyone, with its overarching supranational one-size-fits-all nature, often helps none.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new European Disability Strategy must be based entirely on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Through close cooperation with the rapporteur, we have been able to achieve this where the key points are concerned. Why is this so important to us? Firstly, only then can the EU meet its obligations under the UN Convention. Secondly, it means that our society has to change its perspective in favour of supporting human rights, because the UN Convention elevates inclusion into a basic principle of our lives together – and that is a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="de">People with disabilities do not bear the sole responsibility for adapting to the existing structures for people without disabilities; instead, the social structures need to change, so that they accommodate equally the wide variety of situations in which people find themselves in life, and thus also the reality of life for people with disabilities and people needing support. This applies to all phases of life – from attending ordinary nurseries and schools, through to participating in working life, and workplaces in which people with and without disabilities work together. It also applies to independent living, including in old age and where a person has considerable support needs.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the Commissioner has already mentioned, for an inclusive society, it is essential that every area of life is barrier-free. This applies not just to the built environment, but also to communication and the various kinds of mobility, and it includes linguistic barriers to access. The right of inclusion must extend to everyone, including people requiring particular support.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is so important to us that this resolution states that special arrangements are transitional; something to be overcome. It is clear that we want support from the regulatory system. We want to change tack in this respect. To achieve all this, however, it is essential that there is a ban on discrimination. That is why it was so important to us that this resolution calls on the Council to finally break the deadlock on the fifth Anti-Discrimination Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on the German Government, which is blocking this completely for ideological reasons, to finally take its foot off the brake and allow us to prevent discrimination in every phase of life and give people their rights. For us – and I am appealing to the rapporteur here – it is crucial that this demand remains in the report. Otherwise, the report is worthless as far as we are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we are living through a time in which there is a need to raise awareness of the rights of disabled people and to fight for their full application. These are human rights enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and their additional protocols. It has been signed by all the Member States of the European Union, although only 17 have ratified it so far. We therefore call for all Member States to do so as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, there is also a need to develop EU and national policies and strategies in the area of disability that facilitate the social inclusion of disabled people, that properly support their organisations, and that take account of the enormous difficulties faced by many of the families of disabled people. These must not just stop at a vague European Commission action plan with no fixed timetables, no adequate financial support, no practical measures, and no coherent policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is not enough to say that the human rights of disabled people are recognised, and then to adopt policies that, in practice, threaten their most fundamental rights. That is what is happening with the so-called austerity programmes, with the neoliberal policies of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and with the requirement of meeting the SGP’s irrational nominal criteria, which serves as a cover for pay cuts and for the closure of essential public services for these people, as is happening in Portugal, Greece and other countries. This threatens access to crucial public services, such as health, education, transport and energy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that the majority of the almost 80 million disabled people in the European Union encounter great hindrances in their surroundings – some physical, some social – including services and products that cannot be properly accessed. We know that the level of employment of disabled people whose capacity for work has changed is generally very low throughout the European Union, with only 30-40% of these people actually working. Although it is known that disabled workers are able to achieve significant results if they find a job that matches their experience, skills and interests, as is mentioned in a World Labour Organisation study, the situation is even more serious in the Member States with weaker economies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although this report tackles these issues in general terms, we regret that a proposal that we tabled on the need to create and apply minimum incomes at Member State level was not adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as this would facilitate the lives of many disabled people and their families. We also believe that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) should go no further with its proposal on Article 53. Our final vote will depend on that too.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, like pretty much all my fellow Members, I am in almost full agreement with pretty much all the recommendations in this report, which aims to provide better opportunities for the disabled in our Member States. I do have a couple of important reservations, however. First of all, I want to say that this House must always respect the principle of subsidiarity as a matter of principle. That also means that, in fact, all aspects of social security can best and most efficiently be regulated and funded at Member State level, or even at the level of the regions within the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, I have very serious doubts about recitals 26 and 53. We really should have learned that massive funding via the Structural Funds is far from always efficient as – and I am expressing myself very carefully here – when money comes from Europe, it is, by definition, not carefully managed. If I turn now to recital 53 – why does the very wide-ranging and highly controversial anti-discrimination policy have to be incorporated here? Doing so is unnecessary and stands in the way of potential unanimity. I therefore hope that the amendments concerning these two paragraphs will be approved so that I can also give my backing to the report as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Kósa on his excellent work. I am absolutely sure that we have all worked well, but I am also absolutely sure that we really need to change our approach.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even though so much has been written and given that there are so many regulations and laws at national and supranational levels, as well as agreements and treaties, the fact is that not enough has been done for this extremely numerous group of disadvantaged people. The figure of 80 million Europeans – about 16% of the people of Europe – with disabilities is one that we have often heard quoted. These people need assurances and guarantees of equal opportunities in all respects.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must also bear in mind that the demographic changes that we are always talking about mean that this figure is likely to double by 2050. This huge group of people not only need help, but they also need to be placed in a position in which they have equal opportunities, equal access and the same rights as any other EU citizen.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, we have the technology to really provide these people with the means and tools to become full citizens in every respect. I am thinking, for example, of the battle we have had in Italy to achieve something very simple – subtitling for television programmes – though as an Italian, I am ashamed to say we have had little success so far. Just think, for example, when there are election campaigns, which are now conducted entirely through the media, people with hearing impediments find it difficult to keep well enough informed so as to duly exercise their fundamental democratic right to vote.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I, too, support Mr Kósa’s report. I believe that it is particularly important to mitigate the effects of the crisis and pay special attention to those who, in these times, have greater difficulties in terms of their social inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One of the priorities of the EU 2020 strategy is inclusive growth, and we, too, have responsibilities in this area. This requires people with various disabilities to be able to participate in education and employment and have access to various basic services and goods. Furthermore, we must create an environment that enables them to live independently.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The delegation from Freedom Drive visited us recently, and during discussions with the European Parliament, expressed these wishes and handed over their petition. An important element of this report is that it urges the Council to make real progress, within a set deadline, in adopting the horizontal Anti-Discrimination Directive, which provides equal access in all areas of life.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to call attention to the issue of people living with psycho-social disabilities. Their interest representation is weaker than that of groups with other disabilities. They, too, must have a say in public affairs and must be supported in decision-making processes. The principle of ‘nothing about us without us’ must be implemented in respect of every issue, including in the course of EU resource allocations, and the principle of integration must also be applied.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are eight million people with some form of disability in the EU, and this report covers numerous important issues. It is right to focus on long-term investment for people with disabilities, to look towards social inclusion and to look at problems faced in terms of health care. But it needs to go further. If the European Parliament is serious in protecting the rights of people with disabilities, it should deal with the issue in the same way it now deals with women’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have long held the belief that the focus of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is too narrow. It is time for the rights of other vulnerable groups to be covered by this committee. I believe we need a committee on equalities, which will help deal with discrimination that is based on gender, ethnicity, age, disability and sexual orientation. That would be a truly bold move which would offer support to people with disabilities as well as other groups that are often treated unfairly.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, this resolution is an important one because it deals with the fact that society must improve accessibility and not put people, men and women, with disabilities at a disadvantage. I am particularly pleased that the resolution emphasises the equality aspect of this issue. Reduced freedom for people with disabilities nearly always leads to increased care by women. Women with disabilities are also more often victims of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In a socially sustainable society, there would be no double discrimination of women with disabilities. In a socially sustainable society, women and men with disabilities would have a good quality of life and not suffer social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report and his work on the Disability Intergroup.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I have a feeling in the Chamber that this is a debate about ‘us’ and ‘them’. I think if we spoke more about how disability can and will affect anybody – it is not just an issue at birth but many of us will have a disability throughout our lifetime – then we might be dealing with this in a more practical way.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one issue that I want to specifically address, namely, the spending of European Union funding, particularly cohesion and structural funding. In some areas, we have seen that this is used to re-establish institutions which we have worked to try to dismantle. The message must be – certainly from this Parliament – that people with disabilities should be able to live independently with the structures that they require and should not be forced into institutional living.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be very wrong if European Union funding went against the very principles of the UN Convention. I think that those countries that have not yet ratified that Convention should do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact that there is not enough information on the particular issue of the care of people with disabilities in institutions, which is referred to in the report, is something that absolutely needs to be addressed. I think we need to be aware that we should not allow the most vulnerable to suffer due to economic crisis, and in times of austerity, we need to make sure that they are the ones that we look after best.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final point is as follows. This House is championing the issue of disabilities with our rapporteur. I think that we could equally do with a champion within the Commission. Commissioner, I know your minds are full of other things, such as agriculture – and I include myself in that – but this is an issue that is inclusive of all parts of society. It really needs its voice to be heard, even though we are going through very difficult economic times.</p>

      <p sl="el">However, their fate cannot be determined by an accident of birth. They are entitled to equal opportunities in life. My congratulations to Mr Kósa on his innovative recommendations. I also agree that they need to be integrated and implemented in the Commission’s new ten-year European Disability Strategy, because we need solutions that will safeguard better access for people with disabilities to goods, services and new technologies, equal access to digital literacy and appropriate education and training systems and a plan for everyone that will safeguard accessibility, independent living, freedom of movement and the implementation of e-europe initiatives.</p>

In the Czech Republic, for example, all programmes enabling employment for disabled people are supposed to be removed. The establishment of protected workshops will be restricted, and the disabled will be much worse off for that. This situation is not limited to my own country, but is repeated in other Member States, and we must therefore act together, if we do not want to lose people’s trust in the EU.</p>

I hope we will soon see a single European mobility card. Countries provide their own disabled citizens with a system of reductions, increasing their mobility and their chances of finding employment. As soon as these people cross a border, however, they lose the support. At the same time, the system of reductions based on the student card has been running for years, not only throughout Europe, but also in many other countries of the world. We are talking about the integration of disabled people. I firmly believe that we would like to ease the situation of all the people whose everyday lives are burdened by a disability, and that we do not wish to discriminate between them. I am therefore concerned that the report makes special mention of certain organisations, thereby undermining the general principle of the report.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We have therefore also fought for better conditions, rights and integration for disabled people in specific reports on support for mobility, such as Youth on the Move, Promoting Workers’ Mobility in the European Union, European Schools and others.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This group of people also has a right to mobility and the range of opportunities that EU membership offers us. We must not forget them, and we must see them as people who, despite their handicap, are often exceptionally gifted, able and experienced in many areas.</p>

      <p sl="en">When you look around this Parliament, it is clear that this balance is something that we have yet to achieve here in Europe. As this report rightly points out, equal opportunities cannot be seen as treating people with different needs just the same.

The first of these is inclusive education, which is necessary so that each student’s individual characteristics can be taken into account, as required by Article 24 of the United Nations Convention. The second idea is the need for the employment market to open up to people with disabilities, so that we can meet the Europe 2020 strategy target of 75% employment. The third idea is that the economic crisis must never be an excuse to discriminate against disabled people.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, other significant ideas in the report include a single European mobility card that would allow all benefits and rights to be mutually recognised in the Member States, and a similarly unified travel card to consolidate our efforts to help this group.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, support for the inclusion of people with restricted mobility is one of the priorities of the EU 2020 strategy. The EU also ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in January this year. This step is undoubtedly a sign of the determination of the EU to build a barrier-free Europe for about 80 million people. Fulfilment of the generally defined objectives, however, must include concrete practical steps both at EU and Member State level, and particularly at local community level.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have long been pushing for people with disabilities to have more accessible and properly tailored information on the rights they have for facilitating mobility. As the shadow rapporteur for the White Paper on transport, I would like to encourage the European Commission to present a document setting out the rights of passengers on all forms of transport as soon as possible, on the understanding that the document will have a separate chapter on people with disabilities. There are thousands of everyday obstacles for people with disabilities to overcome.</p>

I am aware of one case in Poland of a person who cannot get about and is having huge problems obtaining a wheelchair because he has to pay some of the money towards the purchase himself and this is becoming impossible for him. It seems that our efforts, whether at European or national level, should be directed towards making it possible for such people to move around freely and not be confined to home. This should not be determined by any payments. Such a person should simply be entitled to move around freely.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, around 88 million people with disabilities live in the EU. For disabled people, mobility in our society means their being able to live their lives with as few barriers as possible, independently, and hence in the way they want to. To achieve this, it is crucial that we integrate disabled people into the labour market more. The employment level among disabled people varies from one Member State to another, but the overall average for the EU is pretty low. There is thus still much to be done; we have a lot of catching up to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">Studies show that disabled people often perform at an above-average level if they are given employment appropriate to their skills and abilities. We need greater awareness of this in the EU. Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, have a key role to play in employing disabled people. The integration of people with disabilities should also be included as a parameter when awarding public contracts.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to provide some clarifications and details in response to certain speeches.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I should like to repeat what I said in my introduction, namely, that the European Commission is drafting a European legislative act on accessibility, which will be preceded by an impact assessment on the degree of accessibility that currently exists in the European Union, in the various Member States, and by a cost-benefit analysis of accessibility measures of an economic nature. Indeed, I believe that, in parallel with legal and legislative measures, we also need to boost the industry, services and production of goods that might be aimed at this group of people, so as to ensure that this accessibility does not just exist on paper but is actually implemented in practice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that this cost-benefit analysis, together with the use of European instruments, will also enable us to find and increase the number of opportunities for disabled people to gain access to the various instruments they need.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to point out that many powers, many responsibilities regarding issues such as employment, education and social protection, lie with the Member States, but that this does not mean that everything should rest with the Member States and that we should do nothing at European level. Firstly, the Commission supports the Member States in their efforts and in their power to take action at national level by providing them with data and indicators on the situation of disabled people and by organising exchanges of best practice, and, secondly, we have the Europe 2020 strategy, which addresses this issue directly and indirectly through various flagship initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I would mention the flagship initiative on innovation, which stipulates that accessibility standards must be met in public contracts provided in the Member States. Secondly, I would mention inclusive growth, or access to employment for disabled people, through initiatives that should come from the Member States and which are supported by specific programmes. Lastly, I would mention the flagship initiative on social innovation in favour of vulnerable persons, which is specifically dedicated to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also wish to make it clear that the Anti-Discrimination Directive, which has been with the Council since 2008, is still being discussed in that institution. I can assure you that the Commission is actively supporting the negotiations taking place in the Council with a view to the adoption of that directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude by pointing out that, in the European Commission’s opinion, Parliament’s Committee on Petitions will still have an important role to play in ensuring that these issues remain at the forefront of public and political attention, rather than being remembered only from time to time, and in maintaining a link with reality when the various legislative proposals are drafted.</p>

I believe that the European Commission must take action in cooperation with Member States and develop strategies for removing the various obstacles and problems encountered by men, women and children with disabilities, to ensure that they can participate effectively in society with the same dignity.</p>

      <p sl="sk">European institutions and the European Parliament (EP) itself have, in the past, focused their attention a number of times on the issue of people with disabilities. Within the framework of legislation, the EP has always tried to promote legal standards that ensure protection of the rights of disabled people. At present, preference should be given to long term investments benefiting the disabled, rather than short term, one-off expenditure. I personally believe it is essential to provide the disabled – regardless of their degree of disability – with help according to their needs. At the same time, however, the aim should be to try and create the conditions for individually-tailored assistance to be as little needed as possible in a truly barrier-free environment. Even though we talk about integration in the sense of integration into society, these people are already fully-fledged members of society. We must strive, however, for their integration through acceptance. Opportunities are equal if the same efforts lead to similar results. It may not be possible generally to apply a unified model for all states, as far as the possibilities for study, employment, freedom of movement or various other activities are concerned. The barriers facing the disabled vary in individual cases. Some Member States emphasise specific aspects more, and others less. One characteristic, however, should be common: the provision of adequate arrangements and guarantees relating to disability, helping towards a full existence within society.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would like to congratulate my fellow Member, Ádám Kósa, for his report. I welcome the fact that he places great emphasis on improving the situation of women with disabilities, because surveys and everyday experience also show that they face the gravest disadvantages during their lives.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The phenomenon of multiple discrimination is mentioned, but not defined clearly in current EU directives, the majority of which are unsuitable for tackling this problem effectively. Disability discrimination also affects women from another direction: it is usually women who are responsible for people with disabilities or who are in need of care, and therefore cuts in public care services have a multiple effect on them.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Women and girls with disabilities face a greater risk of abusive, negligent or humiliating treatment and they are three times more likely to become victims of violence. Furthermore, statistics show that women with disabilities are far less qualified than disabled men or healthy women. In this respect, access to information and communication technologies is of great importance, since these technologies are the primary means towards the integration of disabled people.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On average, every third or fourth disabled person is employed in the EU, but several Member States fall far behind this average. These people must be supported in accessing the labour market or keeping their jobs, and the governments must work together with employers and NGOs to develop initiatives to promote the employment of people with disabilities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">People with disabilities account for a high percentage of EU society, but they often find themselves marginalised, experience difficulties in obtaining employment, and have limited opportunities to meet their basic needs. Many of them live on the poverty line, are discriminated against and excluded from participating in education and social life. The report on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities, adopted today by the European Parliament, proposes numerous solutions which will help to draft more detailed measures aimed at improving the living conditions of disabled people.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should not, however, overlook two important issues: the need to involve those affected directly by decisions in the decision-making process, and the fact that in many cases, the solutions best suited to the needs of persons with disabilities can be found not within the EU institutions, but in the country where the person lives. Yet the report adopted today places a strong emphasis on creating new regulations at EU level, which furthermore are intended to cover not just disabled people, but much broader social groups. This is yet another reason why, despite the many good solutions proposed in the text, I have abstained from the vote.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome this motion and our commitments to the rights of people with disabilities. Unfortunately, the practical application of those rights is often impeded by hindrances in a person’s surroundings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recently, I met a group of people from the Centre for Independent Living, which represents people with disabilities in Ireland. They highlighted the fact that the Personal Assistance Service, which provides disabled people with assistance in many aspects of their daily lives, is not transferable throughout Europe. This means that many people with disabilities are, in practice, denied freedom of movement. They may not be in a position to take up job offers or promotions in other Member States, as they may not be able to avail of a personal assistance service abroad. I feel strongly that this is a service which we must facilitate at EU level, so that all of our citizens can enjoy freedom of movement throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The motion for a resolution deals with an issue of great social importance, and one that we are certainly always aware of, yet it is one that we regrettably overlook, since it does not concern most of us directly on a daily basis. Therefore, I welcome the report on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities. I hope that today’s debate will help remove a lot of the obstacles continually faced by disabled people in our societies. It is important to have a strategy, but it is of paramount importance to implement it. Removing restrictions as regards opportunities for disabled people to travel, providing them with access to new technologies and employment, and taking measures to prevent their social exclusion – these are but a few of the challenges we are facing today. I would like, therefore, to urge the European Commission to develop mechanisms for all Member States that would ensure equal opportunities for people with disabilities to achieve an active life and social integration.</p>

      <p sl="pl">More than 80 million people, which is approximately 16% of the entire population of the EU, are people with disabilities. EU legislation is aimed at ensuring equal rights for all EU citizens, including people with disabilities. Among these rights is the inalienable right to dignity, equal treatment, to live life independently and participate fully in society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Over its history, the European Parliament has often expressed support for improving the lives of people with disabilities. Parliament, which is elected by EU citizens on the basis of treaties, plays a vital role in representing the public interest. The European Parliament therefore has the obligation to continue to provide support for people with disabilities in their struggle for a dignified standard of life and to guarantee greater rights for such people. This should be done by fully involving people with disabilities in the life of the community. Creating conditions conducive to the employment of people with disabilities, making it possible to exercise voting rights by taking away administrative, legal or technical barriers, ensuring consistency of the rules for use of public transport by people with disabilities, or making it easier to gain access to education at all levels should be our priority.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The most important issue is that Parliament has to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are incorporated into the EU 2020 strategy, its main initiatives and development programmes, taking into account, above all, the needs of people with disabilities in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where the system of care for people with disabilities has been neglected for decades, if it ever existed at all.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Heide Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on modernisation of public procurement (2011/2048(INI)) (A7-0326/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="1-064-000" speaker_id="4294" name="Heide Rühle" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, I would like to thank you all for your positive and trusting cooperation in recent weeks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Public procurement is a complex subject; unfortunately, it is also characterised by many conflicting interests. I feel that this makes it all the more important for Parliament to show a united front on this. That can only be done by making compromises, with each group gaining something and losing something. The unanimous vote in committee sent out an important signal. I hope that this compromise will stand firm in the vote tomorrow, but I am also quite optimistic.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is it that we want to achieve together? On the one hand, it is a matter of careful reform of the rules on procurement. We need to keep what has proven its worth, such as the classification into A and B service categories and the separation into two directives; but where there has been a lack of legal certainty, we need to improve that. After all, we are all aware that public procurement was one of the major sources of error in the area of the Structural Funds. That is why it is important to have some clear definitions in this area and to define the scope clearly.</p>
      <p sl="de">A further focal point will be simplification of the procurement directives and making them more flexible. At a time of such deep economic crisis, we have particular need of clear, simple rules. Only then can public procurement be a motor for sustainable development and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The contracting authorities have a particular role to play in this crisis. Public procurement accounts for 17% of gross domestic product. This means that we can use public procurement to steer development towards sustainable products, taking into account life-cycle costs, and we can foster more innovative development. We do not necessarily want the cheapest; what we want is the most economically advantageous offer, and we certainly want an offer that includes the entire life-cycle costs of the goods, services and works.</p>
      <p sl="de">A further point that we focused on in committee is improving access for small and medium-sized enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy, and it is important that they have easier and better access to public procurement. We want to lower their transaction costs, we want to allow contracts to be divided into lots and promote this to a greater extent. We want to simplify and facilitate the administration involved by using prequalification systems or electronic passports.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another focal area will be the strengthening of electronic procurement or e-procurement, because e-procurement will enable costs to be reduced and the whole process to be speeded up. E-procurement can also be used to increase the transparency of the whole procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, it is important for Parliament to point out that this legislation is only the first step. What we need in the area of public procurement is greater professionalism on both sides – both among the contracting authorities and among small and medium-sized enterprises, for example. We want an exchange of best practice models, we want more training programmes, but, of course, we also want to make it possible and easier for people to deal with public procurement by focusing on aspects such as standardisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope this report will receive your support tomorrow. Obviously, there are some minor improvements that can be made, and we will debate these today. There are one or two things that can no doubt be improved, but the general line and the compromises should stand firm in the vote tomorrow. This Parliament will then be able to have an influence on the revision of the public procurement directives.</p>

    <intervention id="1-065-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, honourable Members, I wish to offer my very sincere thanks to Ms Rühle and the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for this report, which is an important contribution. You said, ‘I hope that we will have a tool’. I note, for my part – not least because I have participated in your debates ever since I became a Commissioner – that Parliament has a genuine tool at its disposal in many areas, and we – I, in the work I have been doing over the last few weeks to modernise European public procurement – certainly regard this report as a crucial contribution; what you have written and what you have said together will be extremely useful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Public procurement accounts for 17% of Europe’s GDP. We are therefore talking about economies, about jobs and about growth. I am genuinely very pleased with the convergence that I see between the report on which you are due to vote and the work that I am currently overseeing on the forthcoming legislative procedures. Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, the review of the Public Procurement Directives is part of a general programme to overhaul public procurement throughout Europe. In addition to the review of the directives, this programme, on which I am working with my colleagues, includes a directive on concessions – which have their own specific features, as we well know. This justifies the creation of a separate text, albeit one that remains consistent with the overall reform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This package also includes an external aspect of our policy, with regard to which I am going to propose, in agreement with my colleague, Mr De Gucht, an instrument to guarantee reciprocal access to public procurement at international level. These three initiatives will together make up the legislative package that I am going to propose to the College in a few weeks’ time, in December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What stage have we reached, and what do we plan to do following on from, and in the spirit of, the knowledge you impart in this report?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are working on the following options, which I shall describe to you briefly. Firstly, the simplification of procedures. That is the number one objective. To achieve it, we are working towards the wider use of the negotiated procedure with prior publication. The latter is a good way of helping public authorities to purchase goods and services that genuinely meet their specific needs. This procedure could be accompanied by the safeguards necessary to ensure respect for the principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also plan to drastically reduce the amount of documentation. To be perfectly honest, I believe – and in my previous career as the head of a local authority in my country, I had cause to launch many tendering procedures – that it is excessive for businesses to have to provide at times – and we see this very often in practice – more than 20 documents issued by various authorities, often for a fee, for a single tender bid. This is discouraging many businesses, and especially small and medium-sized enterprises, from participating in tendering procedures. We could therefore replace this documentation with self-declarations by entrepreneurs. Only the tenderer who wins the contract would be required to present valid certificates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we are working towards strengthening and developing the digitisation of public procurement. This is another vital method of simplification. We could make digitisation mandatory in certain cases, in order to make the recording of data on computer – rather than on paper – the standard, or default, method, in the same way as e-mail is used for personal written communication.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of these measures will help to reduce the amount of red tape, both for contracting authorities and for enterprises, especially small and medium-sized ones.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now come to my second objective, which is also in line with your report, namely, finding ways of improving access to public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises, which – I would remind you – make up 80% to 90% of Europe’s economic fabric, and which themselves have a huge amount of job-creation, growth and innovation potential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this aim in mind, we are in favour of eliminating the disproportionate requirements imposed on economic operators with regard to their financial standing. I therefore want to set a maximum level of turnover that may be demanded of a business as proof of its ability to carry out a contract.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also considering a possible allotment obligation, in other words, an obligation to divide public procurement contracts into lots, so that small and medium-sized enterprises can more easily bid for contracts through smaller lots.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, after simplification, we are going to use this package to try to improve the existing legal framework, to help ensure that societal objectives that are, moreover, included in the Europe 2020 strategy, namely, the environment, social inclusion and innovation, can be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, we must be careful not to increase the administrative burden on contracting authorities. I have taken due note of the strong opposition to certain ideas, not least that of imposing ‘what to buy’ obligations that could undermine this simplification objective, expressed during the public consultation, in particular. In this package, we are considering some specific measures to promote the integration, via public procurement, of cross-cutting objectives that correspond to the new requirements of our society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we are working to improve the assessment of life-cycle cost, which encourages public authorities to take into account the entire life cycle of goods when making purchases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are looking at ways of clarifying the scope for contracting authorities to take the production process into consideration. This should enable Member States and contracting authorities to take into account, among other things, employees’ working conditions, respect for the minimum wage, collective agreements and International Labour Organisation conventions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, with regard more specifically to innovation – this is an issue on which Malcolm Harbour regularly updates me and on which he and the other members of the committee are very vigilant – I should like this objective of promoting innovation to become more formal. That is why we are considering creating a new partnership procedure that is specifically aimed at promoting innovative procurement by contracting authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another aspect that is particularly close to my heart, as you know, is social services of general economic interest (SSGEI). I would like to relax the rules further in this area, by giving the Member States even more freedom to organise their tender procedures for SSGEI, in accordance, of course, with the principles of transparency and non-discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we also want to ensure that, in the case of SSGEI, contracting authorities can base their choice on quality criteria and can take all the specific features of these services into account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, Ms Rühle, ladies and gentlemen, we want to work with you to ensure better governance, by professionalising public procurement, in particular, to ensure more integrated procedures, better prevention of conflicts of interest and the implementation of better demand aggregation tools for small contracting authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we said in the Single Market Act, and as I can confirm to you, the Commission will be adopting a legislative proposal on the reform of public procurement before the end of this year. It will be an ambitious proposal. That is why I wish to express my gratitude once again for the quality and the precision of your report, which will help us not only to develop, I hope, good cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, but also to draft sound legislative proposals over the next few weeks.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just heard, the question of public procurement reform is a fundamental one for Europe, particularly at this time of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European rules are generally focused on the criterion of price, which means that our businesses are helpless in the face of foreign operators that do not hesitate to practise social and economic dumping in order to win public procurement contracts in Europe. That is why it is essential to recognise additional criteria, including in the WTO agreement on government procurement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the debate that I led in the Committee on International Trade, I stressed the need to reform that agreement and to extend it to new countries, particularly emerging ones. However, the creation of new instruments is also urgently required. In particular, we need an effective and binding tool for establishing a greater degree of reciprocity with countries that do not offer equivalent access to European operators.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the Commissioner has brought it up, I should also like to receive more details about the legislative proposal that is being drafted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we need to create an instrument for supervising buyouts of European businesses by foreign capital, in particular, by sovereign funds. This is a solution that has already been applied by the United States through an ad hoc committee and which ensures the protection of this strategic sector. Europe, which can be naive or weak when faced with its foreign competitors, would be well advised to take inspiration from it.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first and foremost, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, and the entire Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for their supreme cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control, for which I am acting as the rapporteur here. From the six core tasks that Ms Rühle highlighted, I would like to emphasise core task number 5, namely, ensuring sound procedures and avoiding unfair advantages.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is indeed the case that it is essential, in combating corruption and favouritism, to first ensure that there is better exchange of data, certainly in relation to unsound bidders. As a second point, there is a need to ensure clear rules for the protection of whistle-blowers, and the 2010 resolution from the Council of Europe shows the way in that regard. Thirdly, there is a need to ensure greater transparency and that both governments and the public at large are better informed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ms Rühle’s report deserves our unanimous support, not least because it offers a boost for those also looking to use public procurement to secure quality jobs, wages and working conditions as well as equality of treatment. Those recitals that argue for sound and legally binding agreements in relation to social and ecological criteria and the replacement of the criterion of lowest price by the criterion of most economically advantageous tender thus have my complete backing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Only in that way will we actually obtain high-quality tenders where all the life-cycle costs of goods, works or services are taken into account. Only then will we be going for quality instead of pursuing the mentality of a cheap bookkeeper.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the current rules on public procurement are rigid, complicated and burdensome. This review is most timely and a welcome opportunity to rectify this situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Public procurement is a key market-based instrument which is a vital factor in fostering sustainable employment and can also be geared towards innovative solutions to environmental and social concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">Current rules on public procurement already allow considerations such as social inclusion, working conditions and the needs of marginalised individuals to be taken into account. However, the practical application of the current rules needs both simplification and clarification. With public procurement accounting for approximately 17% of the EU’s GDP, if we simplify the current rules, we could give SMEs a genuine opportunity to come forward with innovative ideas which not only promote economic recovery but also sustainable job creation.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, in view of the EU’s sustainable development objectives, the rules for public procurement must be changed to encourage all public operators to set high environmental, climate, animal welfare and social requirements throughout the whole production process. There are currently many who want to, but do not actually do so on account of the fact that there is a lack of clarity on too many issues, both in the directive and in its application.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Here are a few other requirements in brief: the focus must be shifted from the lowest price to life-cycle costs. It must be made clear that it is perfectly acceptable to set higher animal welfare standards than the minimum levels set by the EU. The directive must make it clear that it does not prevent any Member State from complying with ILO Convention No 94. The requirements laid down must, of course, apply to all subcontractors. Monitoring of the requirements laid down must also improve.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, public procurement can be used to drive both innovation and efficiency, but often innovation is not encouraged when contracts are awarded. Public procurement is already too complicated and too bureaucratic, and mandatory innovation targets would not help. Innovation cannot be made to order. Instead, contracting processes should enable providers to develop clever solutions to challenges, rather than try to specify solutions in advance.</p>
      <p sl="en">On energy efficiency, for example, searching for the lowest price is not always the answer; nor is forcing authorities to purchase individual products, which individually appear efficient but collectively may not be. There does need to be a good dialogue and mutual understanding between the public sector and R&amp;D sectors, but I am not convinced that the Commission’s rigid partnerships are necessarily a good solution. Simplifying processes must be a priority and the EU should avoid over-regulating where this restricts flexibility, innovation or competition.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating and thanking Ms Rühle for all her efforts in drafting this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Public procurement does, indeed, play a vital role in the cohesion policy, especially in the running of projects financed by European funds. Now more than ever, Member States need to spend their European money efficiently. This is why clear provisions are required, aimed at reforming and simplifying European public procurement procedures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is also vital for local and regional authorities to participate in the process of reviewing these regulations, thereby giving them increased autonomy in the area of public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Standardising procedures at the public procurement stage is also a measure which simplifies this process, while also providing an instrument for combating corruption, one of the most common causes of irregularities in the implementation of European projects.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, the European Commission has an important role to play in reforming this system. We call on it to take the necessary measures both to simplify the procedural framework as a whole and to resolve the serious shortcomings relating to non-compliance with public procurement regulations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, after that big round of speeches from the committees that have submitted an opinion, one would think that everything has been said, and that is more or less the case. It is particularly the case given that the Commissioner has also said many things that we welcome, even though we will doubtless have to continue to debate some of them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall begin by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for her receptiveness and her desire to secure a broad agreement in this House. Given the outcome of the vote in committee, she appears to have succeeded.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main objective of this report is, ultimately, to increase transparency and legal certainty in the vast area of public procurement, where a certain amount of simplification is clearly required. It is a huge programme: some details can be found in this report, while we will learn about the others when the Commissioner proposes new legislative measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to mention a few specific points from the report. I am disappointed at the finding that only 1.5% of public procurement contracts in the European Union are concluded across borders. This disappointing statistic must be improved, for example, by making it easier to prepare and conclude public procurement contracts electronically. One point five per cent is not enough to meet the demands of a single market worthy of the name.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are focusing on the general preference for the notion of the most economically advantageous offer rather than that of the cheapest offer. I regard that as a significant step forward. It includes costs that would otherwise not be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, another important aspect is service concessions. I would remind the Commissioner of our firm intention to scrutinise the proposal that he will submit to us on added value and on the proper functioning of the internal market. That is what we intend to do with all our might.</p>

    <intervention id="1-073-000" speaker_id="28177" name="Bernadette Vergnaud" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is a wonderful tool for reviving the European economy, creating quality jobs and choosing more socially and environmentally sustainable offers. To achieve all these things, we have to change our policy of making the lowest price the sole criterion: it is the bedfellow of mediocrity insofar as it obliges public authorities to undertake convoluted procedures in order to choose quality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report on which we will be voting tomorrow introduces the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer, which enables authorities to demand that tenderers meet high standards. I am grateful to Ms Rühle for having defended this principle so well; it will give operators greater flexibility and greater legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another key point is access to public procurement markets, under favourable conditions, by operators in the social economy and small and medium-sized enterprises. European rules are very restrictive for these organisations. They must be improved so that these organisations can respond to major invitations to tender without having to act as subcontractors. In this regard, the very frequent use of this system presents real problems for SMEs affected by tariff dumping and for their employees, who do not benefit from the same pay and social conditions as their counterparts who are employed by large groups. A chain of responsibility must be envisaged. It is unacceptable for main service providers to be allowed to transfer their responsibilities to small subcontractors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on you to vote in favour of maintaining paragraph 22, so that employees’ rights are respected and job-creating small businesses are protected in every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I am pleased that the Member States have been asked to sign ILO Convention C94 on labour clauses (public contracts). That Convention has been around since 1949, but only 11 Member States are signatories to it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I regret that it has not been possible to go further with regard to reciprocal access to public procurement markets in industrialised and emerging third countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe can no longer be the only one to respect the rules, and therefore I ask you to vote against the deletion of paragraph 29.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is a balanced text, and I call on you not to distort it tomorrow. Doing so would undermine the interests of our industry, our businesses and workers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for her report and for such good cooperation. In view of the current debate, this is an appropriate moment to point out that public procurement is a very important way of achieving fair prices for public services and for the procurement of goods for the public sector. Competition is one element of using our scarce resources economically.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is thus a positive aspect of this report that public procurement is to be simplified. This should also facilitate access to public procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises. The measures for achieving this includes consistently allowing self-declarations, the division of contracts into lots – in other words, an SME-friendly tendering procedure – and the introduction of an electronic procurement passport. Moreover, when awarding contracts, the contracting authorities should give greater consideration to the quality of the goods and services to be procured, in addition to the price. It is also sensible for contracting authorities to attach greater weight to future life-cycle costs. In other words, it is no longer simply a matter of the cheapest offer, but rather the most economic offer over the entire life cycle. Greater consideration also needs to be given to environmental sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are the positive points. However, we in the ALDE Group feel there are some points that need revising. There are calls for the bureaucratic requirements on subcontractors to be increased. We see this as a major problem. We also want to have an open market worldwide that cannot be distorted by giving preference to domestic bidders. In return, we want other countries to open up their markets. We are also critical as regards award criteria introduced through bureaucracy; in other words, where certain local authorities are allowed to introduce their own criteria. It is in the interests of the market as a whole to prevent this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I warmly welcome Mrs Rühle’s second report – and I think we should remember that – on public procurement, both on behalf of my group and as chairman of the committee. I think it is quite clear that we are setting the framework within which the Commissioner is going to move forward. I am very pleased, Commissioner – and I am sure my colleagues agree – to see that you are going to come up with an ambitious series of reforms, because we desperately need that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem with public procurement at the moment, as many of you pointed out, is that it is a straitjacket on dynamic markets, sensible solutions, innovation and green growth. I think there is a sense in which public procurers are managing the process and are focused entirely on meeting the rules instead of considering the outcome. That is bad public policy, and now is the time to do something about it: it is one of your twelve levers of growth, Commissioner, and that is the context in which we need to put it.</p>
      <p sl="en">My closing point, which I made in the big meeting we had with commissioners last week, is that we cannot actually wait for two years to implement the new rules. There are a lot of things which could be done in clarifying the rules, and I hope that you will remember that, because we actually need that action now to get growth going.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I am pleased that this report aims to widen the view of what is economically sustainable. The current procurement rules have a far too narrow commercial perspective, that is to say, often the lowest price possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, a low price also has its price to pay, for example, when it comes to how it affects social and ecological sustainability. Thus, it also affects men and women in very different ways.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We therefore need life-cycle analyses and a sustainability and equality dimension to public procurement. This will hopefully result in us instead having a socio-economic perspective on public procurement, thereby moving away from the short-sighted profit-oriented requirements.</p>

The report calls for compliance with the criteria of transparency, clarity, sustainability and accessibility, as well as further simplification and improved legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to support small and medium-sized enterprises and local bodies, I agree with the request to assess the possibility of raising the current thresholds for so-called European contracts. Fairer conditions, simplified access and minimal administrative requirements are also called for. It is important to encourage calls for tenders that stimulate innovation and strengthen the rules on subcontracting, so as to keep health and safety standards always high, by supporting local authorities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my thanks to Ms Rühle and to our shadow rapporteur, Mr Engel, for their excellent work. In reality, a lot of compromises have been made in this report, and they had to be made. This was beneficial overall. I would like to express my thanks for that, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, the starting point – and a lot has been said already that I do not want to repeat – is the fact that, in the area of public procurement legislation, the internal market is not working at present in the way it was supposed to, because in a lot of cross-border procurement processes, no cross-border bids or offers are submitted. That should really give us cause for thought, and I hope that the simplifications proposed by Commissioner Barnier will change this significantly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I feel that the principle of best value for money – the best offer when considered over the entire life cycle – is something that needs to be emphasised more, even though it was not ruled out previously. If we are being honest, this is an aspect of public procurement law that can give rise to a great deal of populism. I would therefore like to thank all the Members here today who have objectively stuck to the facts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another point that could be incorporated today is greater consideration of small and medium-sized enterprises, which is a major concern of my group. Small and medium-sized enterprises can already be brought into the process today through division into lots, however, and this is already happening to some extent.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that we will succeed in keeping inappropriate criteria out of the new draft legislation; that in the end, the party that submits the best offer when the entire life cycle is considered will indeed win the contract.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, and the shadow rapporteurs on their work, which has culminated in a report that is comprehensive, clear and a step in the right direction. They have been able to highlight the changes that are crucial to sound public procurement reform, in particular, regarding greater legal certainty and the need for SMEs to participate more in public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to go back over four points that I believe ought to be included in the future European Commission proposal, which we expect to receive in December. The first is the end of the criterion of lowest price, which is crucial in my view. Public procurement has an impact on the citizens and on our environment. We need to take a long-term view of procurement and ensure that the criterion of the most economically, socially and environmentally advantageous tender takes precedence. By doing so, we will encourage innovation and make faster progress towards the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point is that public procurement can be a real driving force for the promotion of quality jobs, pay and working conditions if we use it properly. We must therefore be vigilant and increasingly opt for sustainable public procurement that incorporates social and environmental criteria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is that subcontracting presents numerous problems and must be examined carefully. Social and environmental criteria cannot be dispensed with to suit these subcontracts; they must remain verifiable and they must actually be verified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fourth point concerns something that has already been said: we must do away with as much red tape as possible so as to enable SMEs, and small enterprises in particular, to participate in tendering procedures. As you said, Commissioner, these SMEs are the wealth creators of the European economy. They must be allowed to develop to their full potential, and obviously I have no doubts about what you have said you intend to do, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am going to have the honour of becoming the rapporteur for this House, and I am eager to work on this crucial issue so as to revive growth, even more so than today, of course. As you said, Commissioner, public procurement, public purchasing accounts for 17% of EU GDP, and I am genuinely eager to work with you, ladies and gentlemen, and with you, Commissioner, to ensure that this tool makes growth a reality again in Europe.</p>

In my opinion, the bottlenecks include excessive bureaucracy, legal certainty, the lack of transparency and also the absence of standardisation and regulation in procurement. In my opinion, we must thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for the fact that the report goes in the right direction and has the potential for future legislation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">What concerns me greatly about procurement, however, just as it does Mr Engel, is the fact that only 5% of public procurement at pan-European level takes the form of electronic procurement. In the meantime, through the use of high-quality application set-ups and other electronic means, it is possible to achieve greater transparency, reduce bureaucracy and apply the principle of good practice, as well as greater awareness of public procurement and greater competition through increased cross-border procurement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the debates on public procurement in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection were indeed lively, emotionally charged and very interesting. I, too, would like to thank Heide Rühle for this report. Those of you who were in Kraków for the Single Market Forum will probably remember that representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises complained that in practice, a lot of tenders are closed to them. Perhaps you remember the story of a Finn who was told at the last minute to provide some documents in Bulgarian and some additional documents which he did not manage to provide on time and, for this reason, was excluded from the tender, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In light of all of this, I was particularly glad to hear everything the Commissioner said a moment ago. The legislative proposal that the Commissioner submitted to the European Commission addresses precisely those expectations which are particularly urgent not only among fellow Members but indeed among the people of Europe and, above all, among businesses. The fact that the Commissioner stresses the need for a separate proposal for a concession in order to open the market and increase transparency in this respect seems to me also to be extremely important and very much worthy of support. I would concur with Malcolm Harbour that time is of the essence in this matter. We need to work on this documentation quickly because the legislative changes are needed now.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is an extremely important task that we have for the future. I very much welcome the fact that the European Commission intends not only to improve legal certainty, but also to put right some aspects that have gone wrong.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, for having included a couple of points that are extremely important to those of us who are members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Firstly, there is the issue that we must ensure that the rights of workers are safeguarded and that social criteria enjoy a prominent place. That is very important to us, because global sustainability includes ensuring that we do not generate poverty tomorrow but that instead, when awarding contracts, we also ensure that reasonable prices are paid, enabling us to protect the lives of workers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important point for us was, and remains, the fact that subcontractors are treated in exactly the same way as contractors – so that when contracts are awarded to contractors, the criteria cannot then be set aside because their subcontractors do not have to adhere to them. This is not a pipe dream, but rather it is a point that is very important to us: ensuring that legal certainty is brought about in this respect, so that we can genuinely make sure that public procurement remains transparent and comprehensible to the public, and so as to ensure fair competition between enterprises – particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. Far from being inappropriate criteria, therefore, these are criteria that are extremely important.</p>

I am therefore very pleased that we have agreed that value for money – the efficient use of money – and not merely low price is to be the criterion for public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is important that, together, we define what that means. Production methods, environmental transparency, sustainability and animal welfare are very important criteria, but they must not provide the opportunity and an excuse to discriminate against companies or suppliers from other European countries. The same conditions must apply to everyone who meets the same criteria.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also very important that we have agreed that we must make procedures simpler, be more flexible and reduce bureaucracy in order to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises can also compete on the same conditions and are genuinely able to offer this option of good quality, wholesome food.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, like many who have spoken before me, I think that Ms Rühle’s report is a good one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Public procurement is an instrument with which public authorities can set an example. Consequently, this idea that the criterion of the most economically advantageous offer should replace that of the lowest price is somewhat in line with our demand at European level for the criterion of GNP no longer to be the only indicator. We are on the right track. However, if you are looking for ways of going further, you could also take the step of proposing bonuses and penalties for companies that fail to meet the requirements in terms of sustainable and quality goods and services when implementing these public procurement contracts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, as you and many others have said, we want to be able to facilitate access for operators in the social economy through this review of public procurement rules at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to raise a third point, which I believe is absolutely crucial, namely, the issue of subcontracting. As you know, Commissioner, large worksites throughout the world are a real disgrace in terms of their compliance with social legislation. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and use competition or the risk of the Chinese winning contracts as an excuse. We need to make these contracts an example of excellence in social terms. This means that you have to review the chain of responsibility issue. Tenderers who win public contracts must shoulder their responsibilities, and that includes going and supervising letterbox companies that encourage modern-day slavery and which we cannot tolerate within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mention has been made of what this sector represents in terms of Europe’s GDP and, consequently, its importance to our economy, as well as to growth and employment. The keywords are important, and I am delighted to point out that they are widely supported. Simplifying documentation, procedures, digitisation and standardisation is one aspect on which all Members have shown their agreement.</p>

Simplification is useful for large, medium-sized and small businesses: in other words, it is useful for everyone. For small businesses, however, the possibility of broadening access to contracts by splitting them into smaller lots would certainly help to combat many distortions, particularly in the area of subcontracting, as has been mentioned by several speakers here.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must thank the Commissioner for planning an ambitious series of reforms, which will innovate and, I hope, introduce new procurement modalities, tackle concessions and projects, and aim for quality in the results to be achieved and the routes to be taken, including respect for the rules of the employment market.</p>

The advantages of public procurement are certainly well known, but the problems are also clear: conflicts of interest between European legislation and the goals of the Member States harm competitiveness. There is a clear dichotomy between the quality of prices and the complexity of laws and procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is crucial to look at existing good practices, specifically in Portugal, where e-procurement has been working well and has facilitated public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Effective European public procurement is an ideal way of controlling the public deficit and increasing growth. To achieve this, it needs to have a stable and predictable legal framework, to follow less bureaucratic procedures so as to attract small and medium-sized enterprises, and to defend social and environmental values.

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague, Ms Rühle, and everyone who worked with her. The issue of e-procurement is an important element of public procurement. Unfortunately, the target proposed by the European Union of conducting 50% of contract award procedures electronically by 2010 was not met, with current rates at barely 5%. Only some countries, such as my country, Portugal, have been successful in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The benefits of e-procurement are all too obvious, and have already been discussed here in Parliament: costly access procedures are replaced with the mere consultation of an electronic platform. In other words, much of the cost for companies, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), is reduced; the number of suppliers is increased through the dissemination of procedural documents and the ease of receiving them over the Internet, thereby expanding competition and enabling better purchase to be made; the contract award procedure is made easier and more flexible; access to European Union contracts, especially for SMEs, is simplified, so facilitating the involvement of the main drivers of the economy in public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, we welcome the European Commission’s strengthening of mechanisms for increasing the scope of e-procurement and would encourage it.</p>

It makes clear how important small and medium-sized enterprises are. I have one comment to add, which is that it is perhaps appropriate, in these times of crisis, to propose a certain minimum, for example, that at least 30% of all tenders need to go to SMEs. At any rate, that would give the governments a reason to definitely enable SMEs to bid. There is therefore a need for conditions to be laid down, but this will, perhaps, take place in a subsequent proposal from Commissioner Barnier, which he has already more or less announced.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I hope that the Rühle report represents an excellent interim step towards obtaining an even better and more active SME sector through procurement policy.

This marks the start of a new period of hope for Spanish society, which will never forget its victims.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we agree with the view that public procurement should accommodate principles like maximising social welfare and environmental protection across the board.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The purchase of goods and services by the public authorities, using public funds, should meet the needs of the public in each Member State, and should do so whilst safeguarding respect for criteria of economic, social and environmental sustainability. However, the creation of a European public procurement market under the specific conditions in which the integration project is currently being undertaken does not ensure that these objectives will be achieved but rather threatens them. In reality, this clears the way towards a market worth almost 17% of EU GDP for large companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The imbalances currently existing within the European Union and the extremely serious situation faced by the weaker economies justify the gearing of public procurement towards the national preference in those Member States. This would stimulate national production, the activity of small and medium-sized enterprises, and shorter supply chains that are more socially and environmentally sustainable. It would therefore constitute an important instrument for economic recovery for essential growth and development, and would enable deficits and obstacles to be overcome.

      <p sl="hu">If we assume that the complicated system of European legislation and its national transposition resulted in simplified public procurement procedures, we are mistaken. In reality, they resulted in higher costs for legal advice, longer procedures, and more work. Therefore, I think that there is a need to synchronise legal remedial and public procurement procedures, as well as to take into account full life cycle costs, as the Commissioner has mentioned.</p>

When public money is invested, high requirements always need to be set, while it is precisely the use of public money that makes it possible to serve the long-term interests that are often not looked after where private money is used. The inhibitory rules stand in the way of such long-termism, of sustainability and innovation, and also of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We all stand for principles, but our differing principles often contradict each other and ensure enormous amounts of monstrous bureaucracy. I therefore propose a very clear examination of innovation and SMEs. Are the rules in that regard set up in the best way? It is perhaps an idea to establish a percentage for this but, in any case, there has to be preferential treatment for the SMEs sector. I also agree that cheap is not good enough.

Earlier, I said 17% of EU GDP, but, to be precise, Mr Tarabella and Mr Staes, that percentage has increased from 17% to 19% today because of the crisis and the economic slowdown that we are unfortunately experiencing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, this just confirms or emphasises the importance of public procurement and of the need for us to use it effectively together on the basis of the information in your report and in the texts that I am drafting on the economy, growth and competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to emphasise the issue that I believe is still the number one priority: simplification in the reform that we are preparing. Simplification should help both contracting authorities and, of course, businesses, and, in particular, as Mr Schwab, Mr Manders and others before them said, small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the current complexity and the cost of simply participating in a tendering procedure are insurmountable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was told the other day that the cost of meeting the administrative requirements for some tendering procedures amounts to almost 30% of the contract amount. Such conditions are beyond belief: a small business has to pay 30% of the contract amount, of the turnover that it hopes to achieve! That explains, Mr Engel, why many businesses give up and why there are so few cross-border contracts and lines of communication between businesses. The situation is already complicated in their own countries, but it is even more complicated in neighbouring ones.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, the first priority is to simplify matters for SMEs and, to do so, we need measures, which I will mention briefly: the wider use of the negotiated procedure, a drastic reduction in the documentation required, and then, as Mr Correia De Campos and Mr Kožušník said just now, the strengthening of electronic procurement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At this point, I should like to say to Ms Tzavela, who mentioned the specific case of Greece and, perhaps, of other countries in difficulty, that we implemented a procedure to simplify public procurement procedures as an exceptional move during the financial crisis. Moreover, your committees are well aware of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of Greece, we have a task force that is working as we speak, Ms Tzavela. Moreover, that task force comprises highly skilled officials from my own Directorate-General, including the former Director-General, Mr Holmquist. We shall make a point of promoting the recovery of growth and work, and the successful completion of, among other things, the 150 projects that are still pending, but we really must have regard to legal certainty when we do so in order to avoid procedures and remedies that block everything. In any case, I am mindful of this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the issues of innovation, social policy and the environment, which many of you raised, including Ms Girling, Ms Westlund and Ms Gebhardt, you asked me what else the Union can do. I believe that, as Malcolm Harbour said, many possibilities already exist within the scope of the current directives. The main priority is to use those directives properly. That is what I am committed to doing, and we are acting along those lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Several of you spoke about innovation – Mr Harbour spoke about it of course, but so did Ms Ford. The European Union strategy, called the ‘Innovation Union’, has defined a new approach. We want to boost performance in the field of research and innovation by bringing innovative ideas and discoveries to the market more quickly. The initiatives in question are intended to ensure that we remain competitive when promoting innovative procurement and, for example, that all Member States and regions in the EU honour their commitment to allocate a total budget of more than EUR 10 billion to pre-commercial procurement and innovative public procurement. This is what my colleague, Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, has proposed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My colleague, Mr Tajani, has, for his part, assigned the Directorate-General for Enterprise to work on the Lead Market Initiative, which helps contracting authorities to set up cooperation networks so that they can share their experiences and jointly acquire and finance innovative solutions while sharing the attendant risks. Consequently, we are launching pilot projects and have recently published a new invitation to tender for innovative projects and set aside a budget of EUR 15 million. Lastly, my colleague, Ms Kroes, has introduced measures to assist contracting authorities when they implement pre-commercial procurement methods.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As part of the public procurement reform that we are preparing, we are going to propose a new procedure, or partnership, for the procurement of innovative products. It consists of specific legislative measures to foster joint cross-border procurement and greater legal protection of innovative solutions as part of a competitive dialogue. All of that will supplement what I have just discussed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the sustainable dimension of the social and environmental aspects that many of you mentioned, we envisage that the production process will be considered from the point of view not only of technical specifications but also of award criteria. Ms Berès talked about bonuses and penalties; I could mention, more simply, the granting of additional points to tenderers that fulfil the conditions in question, whether in terms of social considerations – employee working conditions, respect for the minimum wage, or, as I said, collective agreements or International Labour Organisation conventions – or in terms of environmental considerations, such as the use of green energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I personally have another concern, which I know many of you share, and that is cooperation between public authorities. I know that contracting authorities that wish to cooperate with each other often have difficulty today in distinguishing between situations in which the European procurement directives do or do not apply. That is why my services and I published a guide at the beginning of October to explain and clarify the framework that currently applies in this area. This document is intended for anyone involved in public procurement: it consolidates the case-law of the Court, making it simpler and more easily understandable for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to go further and have even more legal certainty in this area. For this reason, I should like to include rules on public-public cooperation in the context of the reform that we are preparing. Several of you raised this issue of legal certainty, including Ms Gáll-Pelcz just now. I shall, of course, bear in mind the concerns expressed by many of you with regard to transparency and the issue of subcontracting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is another aspect that I wish to point out: the proper application of the rules. In some exceptional circumstances, they should be simplified as well. We will achieve this in two ways: firstly, via the role that the centres of excellence must play in supporting purchasers and, secondly, via the involvement of Member States in ensuring that these rules – including their social aspects, Ms Sartori – are applied better.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the second section of the legislative package, I heard Mr Engel’s warning loud and clear when he told me that he was going to scrutinise the proposal that we are going to make on concessions. This issue was raised by Ms Thun und Hohenstein also. I have no ideological position on this issue. I just note that, 30 years on from the creation of the internal market, there are still no basic rules on service concessions. We are therefore going to make some proposals, which I hope will be as intelligent as possible, without wishing to interfere with, pick apart or weaken the small concessions that are of interest to many local authorities. I believe that, for the sake of transparency, legal certainty and good management, we need a minimum framework for regulating service concessions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Does this mean that public services will have to be outsourced? I believe that this criticism that I hear now and then is unfair. Under EU law, public authorities are free to choose whether they carry out the public interest tasks that are assigned to them by using their own resources or by calling on external bodies to carry them out. If a public authority decides to use the services of a privately funded external body, on what grounds should we oppose it, if the decision is taken under fair and transparent conditions? The internal market in concessions must ensure that citizens benefit from services, particularly services of general interest, that offer the best quality-price ratio, and that businesses, particularly small businesses, can access procurement markets in the other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, a number of you, including Mr Arif and Ms Vergnaud, talked about the external dimension of the public procurement reform. My colleague, Mr De Gucht, and I are going to propose that the EU establish a clear and simple instrument that gives legal certainty to our purchasers and to businesses, European and non-European alike, by reflecting our international commitments in EU law. At the same time, we will establish a method of uniformly processing tenders from countries with which we do not have an agreement, such as China and India.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I apologise for those somewhat brief answers. This report is extremely important and useful, and I want to make that clear to Ms Rühle. I shall use it, and we may have further discussions on certain points. In any case, it has come at the right time, since, in the next few weeks, I will be proposing that the College of the European Commission adopt proposals aimed at modernising our public procurement legislation in the following three areas: modernisation of public procurement and simplification, concessions under the conditions that I have mentioned, and external dimensions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I wish to thank you, Ms Rühle, and all of your colleagues for having drafted this report, which is extremely useful to us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to express my warmest thanks to the Commissioner for the fact that he wishes to incorporate our comments into the revision and take them into consideration. I would also like to thank everybody for their comments this evening. I would specifically like to mention one point. In 2004, we also set ourselves the objective of simplifying the public procurement directives. Unfortunately, the result was not what we were aiming for. This was not just because the wording of the legislation at European level was highly complex, but also because the complexity was increased still further in the course of implementation in the Member States. We need to work on that if we really want to simplify things this time. It is not just a matter of the European public procurement directives being clear, simple and flexible; it also matters that, when implementing them in national law, the Member States must not make the rules more complicated than necessary and do not impose additional requirements. That is also important and is something that we need to take into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to mention one other point that I feel is particularly important in this debate. If we want to give the contracting authorities and small and medium-sized enterprises more room for manoeuvre, then we need to make sure that we do not impose new set requirements. A couple of times during this debate, we heard people mention quotas. I consider that extremely difficult. Set requirements will tend to increase bureaucracy, because in some Member States, they will be easy to achieve, and in others more difficult. In the end, we would then need a compromise that is very difficult to implement. That is why I am resisting this. I have always said quite clearly in this report that we do not want set requirements. What we want is greater local democracy, better access for small and medium-sized enterprises and simplified procedures, but no additional regulations.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the first point. One further point that is very important to me is that we have said that we do not want the cheapest offer, but rather the economically most advantageous offer. Further evidence for this was provided in Kraków. During the debate, the Polish representative said that because the wording of the European public procurement directives was unclear, 80% of contracts in Poland were awarded to the cheapest bid and not to the economically most advantageous offer. That is the direction we want to go in, and I consider this to be important. If we move in this direction, however, it is essential that we do not create additional bureaucratic requirements here, but instead facilitate and simplify matters, provide more assistance, and have greater exchange of best practice.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I participated in the debates concerning the Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party on the Committee on the Environment.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I can gladly say that our Committee widely agreed that by promoting a broader application of environmentally friendly ‘green public procurement’, we can take meaningful steps towards a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In view of the aforesaid, I am of the opinion that in future public procurements, more emphasis will need to be given to rules ensuring the application of sustainability criteria. One of the primary means of achieving this is to put an end to the monopoly of lowest prices among award criteria, and instead allow for the selection of the economically most favourable offer, which also takes into account the life cycle costs and environmental advantages of the services concerned.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The report is correct in pointing out that in order for all this to be put into practice, we naturally also need the Commission to develop a methodology for the quick and voluntary calculation of life cycle costs, which is to be made widely available to contracting authorities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Another important aspect for me as shadow rapporteur was for the participation of small- and medium-sized enterprises in green public procurement to be increased. Accordingly, in its opinion, the Committee on the Environment proposes that in case the object or service for which public procurement has been announced is also available locally, it should be possible, based on the principle of proximity, to reserve the procedure for local SMEs, whereby the environmental impacts caused by the procurement, such as the CO2 emissions from shipping, could also be reduced. Similarly important is the objective of reducing administrative burdens and setting clear and transparent requirements at directive level.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The main purpose of public procurement must remain the purchase of goods, works and services by public authorities to accommodate the needs of their citizens and ensure effective use of public funds. We need simplified procedures, flexibility and better information. We also need legal certainty and less red tape.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A properly functioning public procurement market is a key driver of growth and a cornerstone of the single market. Furthermore, it is fundamental to stimulating competition and innovation and to addressing rapidly emerging environmental and social public policy challenges, as well as work quality issues, including adequate pay, equality, social cohesion and inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that European public procurement rules must contribute substantially to increasing transparency and ensuring equal treatment, as well as to combating corruption and putting the procurement process on a professional footing. It is also important that public procurement law refocuses on its core task of guaranteeing transparency, non-discrimination and competition.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Public procurement is, without doubt, one of the most important factors determining the competitive functioning of the single market. Each year, billions of euro are spent on purchasing public works or services, and there is therefore a need for the public procurement rules currently in force to be reviewed so that they are consistent with the main goal of public procurement policy, i.e. meeting citizens’ needs as well as guaranteeing the effective use of public money. When stating my views on this issue, I have, on several occasions, stressed the need to establish an EU-wide public procurement system based on common principles and to move towards a more effective electronic procurement system. At certain stages, this would enable us to eliminate the human factor, which is why the current public procurement system is not very effective, lacks transparency, is too complicated and inflexible. I believe that the establishment and introduction of common principles throughout the EU would open up much greater opportunities to purchase works, goods or services at significantly lower prices, which would allow the creation of a more transparent, clearer and better functioning public procurement system.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The review of the Public Procurement Directive is one of the most important undertakings embarked on by Commissioner Barnier and will have a particular impact on the whole economy, and not just on the contracting authorities. SMEs are the driving force of economic growth in the EU. This is why their growth must be sustained, including through public procurement. In their current form, the procedures are far too complex to enable SMEs to participate in tenders. This is why I support splitting contracts into lots to make the procedures more accessible to SMEs. At the same time, I think that the rules need to offer public authorities flexibility. Using price as the sole criterion has led to unsatisfactory results in many cases. I feel that it is much more sensible to take into account the product’s entire life cycle when estimating the cost, which also means its environmental impact, where appropriate. I think that, as long as the link is maintained between the contract’s subject matter and the criteria set, public procurement can be used in a pragmatic way to establish synergy with other European policies and achieve other objectives, such as environmental targets or encouraging innovation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Public procurement policy could be a real driver in promoting high-quality jobs, wages and conditions, equality, skills development, training, and environmental policies, and in providing incentives for research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legislative proposal to overhaul public procurement policy, which the Commission is to present shortly, should include provisions to ensure that the lowest price is no longer the determining factor for the award of contracts, and that it is replaced by the criterion of most economically advantageous tender, in terms of economic, social and environmental benefit.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current provisions on subcontracting should also be strengthened. The use of several levels of subcontracting can cause problems in terms of compliance with collective agreements, working conditions and health and safety standards. Public authorities should be informed of all details of the use of subcontractors before a contract is concluded. Indeed, the Commission should investigate whether we need further rules on the award of subcontracts – for example, to establish a chain of responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">There should also be a reassessment of the appropriate level of thresholds for supply and services contracts – which should be raised if necessary – in order to facilitate, inter alia, not-for-profit and social economy operators’ access to public procurement contracts.</p>

      <p sl="lv">On the subject of the modernisation of public procurement in Europe, I should like to draw attention to a number of things. First, the criterion of lowest price should not be the determining one and must be replaced by the most economically advantageous tender, taking into account the entire life-cycle costs of goods, services or works. Second, the legislation must be flexible, so that institutions such as hospitals and schools can have access to healthy and value-for-money food, rather than merely the cheapest available, and so that they can have the opportunity to choose regional produce, which would prevent further environmental pollution. Third, we must encourage measures that would reduce the transaction costs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); for example, the ‘once only’ principle, whereby, at the end of the procurement process, original documents would be required only from the successful tenderer, or the development of a standardised ‘procurement passport’ in the form of an electronic registration system storing the relevant certification documents. Fourth, in order to prevent and fight corruption, more efficient reporting practices, including exchanges of information between Member States on the exclusion of unsound bidders, as well as the exclusion from public procurement of bidders found guilty of misconduct until they have undergone ‘self-cleaning’. Fifth, practical progress in Europe on standardisation and infrastructure issues, on e-signatures and time-stamps, for example, on which the Commission must develop common standards, is essential for the development of e-procurement.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Public procurement in the European Union is a strategic segment of the single market, while also being a key element for fulfilling the Europe 2020 strategy objectives. Local and regional authorities feature among the most important purchasers in Europe, thereby playing a key role in applying the regulations for awarding public procurement contracts. I think that more attention needs to be paid to these authorities, which must be included in the process for reviewing EU public procurement regulations. This process should provide them with increased autonomy. Greater attention needs to be focused on SMEs, too, as they form the backbone of the EU economy, offering huge potential in terms of creating new jobs, growth and innovation. Furthermore, a balance has to be struck between the desire to simplify procedures and the need to ensure fair competition in public contracts and achieve the best results. I think that improving and simplifying the procedures will help allocate the funds more quickly, achieve higher rates of absorption, ensure the funds are used more effectively and reduce errors.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The modernisation of public procurement and the reform of the rules connected with it will be one of the most important tasks of this current Parliament. The public procurement of services, labour and goods accounts for some 17% of the EU’s GDP. The issue concerns a significant sum, therefore, but also a lot more.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Public procurement will be one of the Union’s main instruments in achieving the Europe 2020 targets. For example, public procurement may play a much bigger role than before in the promotion of new, resource-efficient innovations. It is especially important now to adhere to the principle contained in Parliament’s report that the lowest price criterion is not the determining factor: we need a far more ambitious set of criteria, which combines economic, social and environmental benefits. It is also crucially important to ensure that quality services are also on offer in areas where there is not necessarily always any genuine market competition.</p>

      <p sl="de">In the modernisation of public procurement, the award criterion of the economically most advantageous offer is no longer of benefit to us. In times when we are facing economic crisis and climate change, it is wrong simply to ignore socio-political and ecologically sustainable services. I am in favour of adopting the report, but now the work begins in earnest. I advocate the criterion of the most advantageous offer in terms of sustainability, in order to bring these essential political ideas into the markets and into economic life. The secret is in the mix: of course price has a significant role to play, but we need to get used to the idea that innovative, social, long-term criteria have an equally crucial role that cannot be simply ignored. These social and quality criteria, which must be effective at national and regional level, need to be binding contractual requirements not just on contractors, but also on subcontractors. I consider it important that social standards, respect for collective agreements and the payment of statutory minimum wages in the performance of the contract, as well as in the upstream and downstream supply chains, are made binding criteria in the award of contracts, in order to maintain the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. The social aspect needs to be a common thread throughout public procurement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Public procurement not only needs to be made more flexible; it also needs to be made more sustainable. We must use the revision of the procurement directives as an opportunity for a change of strategy in favour of qualitative growth. We need to use public procurement to get rid of existing inequalities and to provide ecological incentives: it is a matter of good work on public contracts, adhering to collective agreements and maintaining and checking social and ecological standards. These requirements are more important than ever when faced with strict budgetary constraints. I am pleased that the report incorporates some of these demands, particularly the anchoring of social and ecological standards and the removal of the criterion of the cheapest offer. We need to maintain this line in the announced revision of the directives at the end of the year. We need to go even further, however: it is a matter of the protection of posted workers, compliance with working standards and collective pay agreements and good work. I hope that the Commission has noted the signal we have sent and will take it into consideration when making its proposals. Public procurement is not a market-based instrument for achieving the aims of the EU 2020 strategy, but rather needs to be used to develop the social and ecological aspects of the European project further.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, this question was provoked by the drastic changes that have come about on the small and medium-sized enterprise market following the serious recession we are currently experiencing.</p>
      <p sl="el">The review of the Small Business Act has highlighted the specific problems faced, namely, access to funding, the black market, which is undermining small and medium-sized enterprises, and the internationalisation of European enterprise.</p>
      <p sl="el">In fact, all this is highly constructive and our question now is how far has it progressed, how many Member States have adopted these proposals, and where do we now stand?</p>
      <p sl="el">However, the point I wish to emphasise right now is that small and medium-sized enterprises are in dire straits when it comes to borrowing in countries which are experiencing the deepest recessions, such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland. There is a fast-growing default rate on bank loans by small and medium-sized enterprises. Their financial planning was different, their customers’ purchasing power has shrunk, and wages have fallen by 50%.</p>
      <p sl="el">I therefore suggest, Commissioner, that a central European regulation is needed on loans taken out by small and medium-sized enterprises. Their loan repayment dates also need to be extended and Euribor-based interest rates need to be cut.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso has already highlighted the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises: 99% of all enterprises in Europe employ fewer than 250 people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Small and medium-sized enterprises are thus the backbone of employment and training. With the Small Business Act, the European Union began an initiative to improve national and European legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises. It was in this context that the test of the impact of legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises was introduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, however, a study by the European Parliament has shown significant variation in the way that this SME test is being implemented in the individual Member States, and that in some cases, it is being implemented badly. Only five Member States have made this SME text a binding requirement. Fourteen Member States apply it half-heartedly, irregularly and with varying quality, while eight Member States practically do not carry out the test at all. That is why we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled this question and are calling for the Commission to start an initiative to make this impact assessment a genuinely binding requirement in the Member States. We want the costs of administration and red tape to be quantified, in order to work towards reducing these. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be saved from national and European legislation that burdens them with more and more additional costs for bureaucracy and administration.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are in favour of implementation being made very flexible, so that the Member States have room to manoeuvre. However, the aim must be for the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises to be taken into consideration as part of an integrated approach to law making. We also want the Commission to set an example by being the driving force behind this SME-friendly implementation of legislation. We in the European Union should take the lead in making laws that are genuinely capable of being implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises in practice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, first, I must apologise for the absence of my colleague, Mr Tajani, who would have liked to have followed these issues very closely and proactively, as you know. He has been held up this evening by a G20 preparatory meeting. He has asked me to give you his analysis and to listen to you on an issue in which I myself am involved as the Commissioner for the Internal Market, as you can well imagine. I will also begin by thanking Ms Tzavela and Mr Theurer for having taken the initiative just now to question the Commission about the Small Business Act dossier.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to point out, following on from the debate that we have just had on public procurement, that the 21 million small and medium-sized enterprises account for 99% of European businesses and that almost 90% of them contribute to the creation of new jobs. Ninety-nine per cent of Europe’s economic fabric is made up of these SMEs, which are therefore the key to the growth that we want to rebuild or consolidate, and to our dynamism and our competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you both pointed out, however, these businesses are experiencing great difficulty, particularly at the moment, and, as SMEs, they are encountering too many obstacles that are restricting their mobility as exporters and traders within the internal market. That is precisely why I and my colleagues, and particularly Mr Tajani, have proposed in the Single Market Act legislation to help those who wish to innovate, export, become mobile and trade, which is obviously the case with SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly, there are many other difficulties, which I will mention briefly: administrative burdens, lack of liquidity, problems in accessing finance – you made that point, Ms Tzavela – lack of visibility in the market with regard to potential investors. They are all hindering the development of SMEs. According to an impact assessment on SMEs and the labour market, the crisis has cost nearly 3 million jobs in European SMEs. That is why we must act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not a new issue. It was the subject of work carried out as early as in 2008, when a cross-cutting, ‘tailor-made’ approach for SMEs resulted in the adoption of the Small Business Act. The latter has enabled significant progress to be made. I should like to cite some examples: the timescales and the costs necessary to start a business have been reduced, and we have adopted important legislative acts, such as the directive on combating late payment and the directive on reduced VAT rates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the SME test that you yourself mentioned, Mr Theurer, has yielded some positive results. It has been in place since 2009 and is duly applied to proposals having an impact on businesses, something which has also been recognised in a recent study by the European Parliament. Such tests have been carried out, in particular, for the report on the Late Payment Directive and on the ‘standardisation package’. Nevertheless, Mr Theurer, I believe that we must go further, as you yourself requested, and, on Mr Tajani’s initiative, the Commission will be organising a workshop in every Member State in order to roll out these SME tests as much as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When the Small Business Act was reviewed in February, the Commission pledged to enhance this test, and, at the June European Council, President Barroso gave some indication of the direction in which we are working specifically to enhance the part of the SME test that concerns micro businesses. Greater visibility of this test is something else that we want to ensure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this tool, the Small Business Act, is very useful to us when it comes to maintaining the consistency of our work to support SMEs, and it must be enhanced in a number of areas, which I should like to mention quickly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first priority is the programme to support the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission has proposed a budget of EUR 2.7 billion to support SMEs and, in this regard, we hope that we can count on the support of Parliament in the next financial perspective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During that debate on the future financial perspective, we also proposed that the budget allocated to supporting SMEs should be doubled. We will also take care to ensure that those funds are allocated, first and foremost, to SMEs that are in the initial growth phase, which is often the most sensitive and most fragile phase for them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those funds will be useful to us, but we are also working on tools to solve funding accessibility problems at their source, with measures in three areas: venture capital, stock markets and bank credit. These are issues in which I take a more personal interest, as you know, within the context of my internal market and financial services responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the Single Market Act, we proposed legislation to encourage the mobility of venture capital funds in Europe, which we are going to present in the next few weeks. On the basis of this measure, I and my colleagues, and, in particular, Mr Tajani, shall be looking very closely at the idea of creating a European venture capital fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My services and I are also working on ways of mitigating the threshold effects that are preventing a very large number of SMEs from being able to launch themselves on the stock exchange, and on ways of increasing liquidity in these markets, which is currently too low.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Tzavela, you also mentioned access to bank credit. We are well aware that one of the consequences of the crisis is that this bank credit has been restricted, and we have an extremely demanding dialogue with the banks. I am also very mindful of the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that the legislation that we draft, that we present, such as that on the implementation of the Basel rules on non-prudential capitalisation funds and liquidity, which I presented on 20 July, should have special regard to small establishments that are often – on the ground, in the regions, in your countries – banking establishments: there are 8 300 banks in Europe, and they are the ones that finance the real economy, as we know.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Attention will also be paid to SMEs and their innovative role in the future Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. Still in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, and with the specific aim of supporting the risk-sharing finance facility, in early 2012, we are going to launch a new project to make it easier for SMEs that are engaged in research and innovation activities to access bank loans. This new facility will be allocated a budget of EUR 120 million.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also going to continue our work to encourage SMEs to participate in European funding programmes – I am thinking, in particular, of the Structural Funds here. My colleague, Johannes Hahn, is particularly concerned with ensuring that these programmes become more accessible to SMEs. I am monitoring this issue from the point of view of public procurement, but it is also important to facilitate SME access through the Structural Fund regulations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Reducing the administrative burden on SMEs is another major priority. We have an action programme to reduce these burdens, which will come to an end in 2012. We are on course to meet the target to which we have committed ourselves of reducing them by 25%. I believe we could even exceed it if the proposal that we have made to exempt micro businesses from the accounting rules were to be adopted quickly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All in all, we have already presented more than 200 proposals to simplify the existing legislation and reduce administrative burdens by more than 31%. The proposals that have been adopted thus far represent a 22% reduction, or thereabouts, in the administrative burdens on businesses, and we are going to continue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Priority number three: the Commission intends to present a new, more consistent strategy to make it easier for SMEs to access public procurement markets. We have just discussed this at length, so I will not go back over it. However, it comes under the simplification of public procurement markets, of public procurement in general, which is a definite priority for the Commission, or for me in any case, as I said earlier. I should also like us to encourage this reciprocity of access where international markets are concerned; this is the aim of the transposition of the multiannual Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) into EU law, which Mr De Gucht and I will be proposing to you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to open up to SMEs markets that should be accessible to them, we have also proposed to extend the European standardisation system to cover services, while further opening up the framework for the development of standards to SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To be more specific, in the long run, we hope that a culture of partnership can be established between all the stakeholders and that the problems on the ground can be resolved. We have no business drafting theoretical or ideological legislation. We must draft very practical legislation for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I would say the following in particular to the two MEPs who have tabled these two very useful questions: if you read carefully the Single Market Act and the 12 key proposals that I and around 10 of my colleagues have identified, as well as the 50 proposals that we are implementing, you will see that all of this legislation is proactive legislation aimed at facilitating the work of SMEs. This also applies to issues that I have not had the time to mention, such as the European patent, which Parliament supports and which is often inaccessible to SMEs today on account of its cost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My colleague recently appointed a Commission representative, Mr Calleja Crespo, to monitor the implementation of EU measures on all SME-related issues with the Member States. He is supported at national level by the ambassadors for SMEs. The first meeting of this network took place in Brussels on 14 September and mainly focused on the issue that you have raised, Ms Tzavela; namely, access to credit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, close cooperation between all the European and national institutions is crucial to the effective implementation of this Small Business Act and, more generally, of the Single Market Act and all these initiatives, and to enabling European SMEs to withstand this crisis. In order to successfully overcome this crisis and win the growth, employment and competitiveness battle, it is imperative that SMEs hold their own and, to ensure this, we must help them in any way we can.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the commitment he has shown to small and medium-sized enterprises. The Small Business Act is the umbrella that is intended to encompass the legislation relating to our small and medium-sized enterprises. There are three aspects that are important when we are discussing this matter: 1) access to capital; 2) access to the markets, which we have discussed today; and 3) tackling administrative burdens.</p>
      <p sl="da">There is no doubt that the economic crisis has made it very difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to gain access to capital. I look forward to the Commission’s proposal in which, by means of guarantees, we will ensure that healthy and well-functioning small and medium-sized enterprises are given the opportunity to obtain access to capital. Access to markets obviously entails a well-functioning internal market. However, it also entails an opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises to reach out and have a share in the growth of the new emerging countries. I am talking here about China, India, Brazil and other countries. We know that they have high growth rates, and if we are to increase growth in Europe, our small and medium-sized enterprises must reach out and gain access to these markets, and that is something that we need to help them with.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, there is no doubt that if we are to set about combating bureaucracy, it is important that the Member States – but also we here in the European Parliament – put their own house in order. The fact is, we know that the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive IV will involve greater bolstering of the banks. This once again means that the banking market for small and medium-sized enterprises will suffer. We therefore need to support the legislation in this area.</p>

Therefore, if small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are our top priority, I would call on the Commission, alongside Parliament, to make absolutely sure that our good principles are put into practice and that the Member States turn the legislative initiatives of the Small Business Act (SBA) into highly effective, high-quality, concrete measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">Just think, Commissioner, what would happen if the Late Payment Directive were implemented early in all the Member States, and what a great benefit to SMEs it would be! The SME tests are important, but we are still at the method stage. Of course, it is only right to check that the laws we make really are suited to SMEs and further their interests, but we would urge you to persevere and examine the issues very thoroughly when setting up this framework of opportunity that you have sketched out. We also appreciate what the Commission has been doing and we are ready with the budget and the other options that we have to support it.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would just like to say a word about credit. We have to make our position clear to the banks – I am saying this to you, Commissioner – because SMEs need help …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome the Commission’s proposals and I pay tribute to the work of Parliament’s rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="de">SMEs are the bread and butter of our economy. They are the reservoirs of entrepreneurial spirit, the employment generators and the embryos of tomorrow’s big businesses. In the past, they have too often been overlooked by the social partners representing big industry and big employers. Key to their success is access to finance. The European Investment Fund has been hugely important for small businesses in my constituency and I welcome the Commissioner’s commitment to consider new opportunities for venture capital.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, access to finance is important and we need to ensure that our banking system, when recapitalised, is lending again to small businesses. We welcome too the Commission’s proposals on late payments. I hope the Commission will do something about simplifying VAT, particularly in cross- border transactions. I visited a local firm in my constituency, Foundrax in Somerton, who tell me there are currently some 27 VAT thresholds in place; that makes it very difficult for small businesses to trade. I hope, too, the Commission will look again at employment law, which requires impact assessments and sometimes sunset clauses to be able to deal with small businesses.</p>

Do you see progress at the moment? Is it not just more of the same – in other words, excessive bureaucracy? Also, comparing this with your experiences in China, would you say that SMEs – where they exist, and many do exist – are subject to less regulation in China than in the European Union?</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe we have, broadly, the framework for legislation for SMEs right.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I can identify with what the Commissioner has said, because in my constituency of Northern Ireland, over 99% of the businesses are SMEs, and we depend on them for growth. The impact on the regional economy at the moment is very severe because of the economic climate. In the current financial climate, SMEs across Europe are operating in these tough times, so those small businesses face various pressures – not least, difficulty in accessing credit. Where I come from, this is a tremendous problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, another issue is the red tape and bureaucracy which they have to contend with on a daily basis. I would be interested to hear the answer from the Commission regarding the effectiveness of the Small Business Act and, in particular, the SME test, in proving to be truly effective in analysing the effects of EU legislation on SMEs across the different Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Small Business Act is a fine thing; it is not a law, however, but a proclamation. If we want the Commission genuinely to set an example – as Mr Theurer said – as regards an SME-friendly approach, then we need to pay attention to two things in particular: to the question of funding, and to the question of decision-making options. I would like to make three points regarding these.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, research programmes. I am still not happy with the way that the negotiations between the Directorate-General on Enterprise and Industry and the Directorate-General on Research and Innovation have been conducted to date concerning the future of what we have come to know as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, which has been an extremely beneficial programme for small and medium-sized enterprises. We will have to see how the Business Competitiveness and SME Programme works in future. This House must impose one criterion on the Commission, however. For small and medium-sized enterprises, it is not just a matter of more funding; it is also a matter of making access to these programmes easier and less bureaucratic than was the case previously.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also a matter of adopting a broad definition of innovation. This was one of the main topics when representatives of SMEs met in Brussels a few weeks back for the European SME Week. One of the principal aspects that they want us to consider is that innovation is more than just research, particularly for these small and medium-sized enterprises. Innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises can also make a contribution to the great social challenges. That is why we must make things more accessible for them, and not leave them dependent on the large enterprises that have plenty of resources for research. It is time for the Commission to show that its fine words can also be put into practice for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now for my second point: Structural Funds. I am grateful that Commissioner Barnier has mentioned this. Access for small and medium-sized enterprises needs to be drastically improved. We need to have local and regional partnerships between the public sector, research facilities, universities and small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many outstanding examples of this, such as Steinbeis or Innovation Vouchers, or the example of Cambridge. There are many examples from which we can learn how to improve the position of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final point: we also need to give SMEs greater responsibility when it comes to governance structures. It is regrettable that the Commission has not been able to give small and medium-sized enterprises voting rights in its proposal for the renewal of standardisation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will talk about the area I know best, northern Italy. The most important issue for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the moment is access to credit; it is far more important than excessive red tape, the tax burden or international competition, particularly from China.</p>
      <p sl="it">The banks are being forced to recapitalise and get rid of the debts caused by their financial speculation, and so they are not granting any more credit to SMEs, which are too small to have their own capital resources or to provide guarantees. Small businesses are therefore unable to contribute to the country’s economic recovery, even if they are willing to do so.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore essential to expand credit schemes of various kinds in favour of SMEs and to improve information about the availability of the financial instruments at their disposal, the Structural Funds in particular. Without money, there is no research, no equipment renewal and no possibility of investing, and therefore it is impossible to contribute to the country’s wellbeing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are familiar with all of it. It has all been said already – just not by everyone. I do not want to join in; instead, I want to praise you again, Commissioner. What you have said is right and important. It is just that it has not yet come about. The reality – if you have dealings with representatives of SMEs – is still a long way away from what the European Union can actually achieve, whether in reducing bureaucracy or in access to the appropriate public funding. You know the figures: only 34% of all public contracts that are put out to tender in the European Union go to SMEs, even though, on average, they account for more than half of economic output. There is a reason for that, and it has a great deal to do with what you are specifically doing. That is still a challenge for you. We can be optimistic; indeed, I would like to be.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I have frequently had opportunity to draw up reports dealing with standardisation of statistics and easier access. At the end of the day, however, it is always largely concerned with ease of reading and access to information. A lot more could still be done in the area of your Internet portals and the opportunities to get funding with as little red tape as possible. I would urge and encourage you to pay particular attention to this as you carry out your duties.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, whenever there has previously been any discussion about SMEs, the focus has been on intervention in financial matters, the lack of liquidity and problems in accessing credit, because that is really the main problem. It is the main problem for governments, SMEs, all companies, banks and, to a large extent, I would say it is the main problem, above all, for each and every member of society.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, allow me to focus on one dimension that I feel is strategically fundamental, and that has only been partially touched upon. It is to do with the internal market. Over recent weeks, the European institutions have been insisting on the importance of taking a decisive step forward in developing the internal market as a strategic element or strategic factor in overcoming the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we look at the relationship between the internal market and SMEs today, we can see that only 23% of these companies engage in cross-border trade, and that only 13% export outside the European Union, and this gives us a clear idea of how far we still have to go in this area. The problem is that it is very difficult to tackle the current legislative fragmentation on basic issues in the internal market. When SMEs compare the costs and profits, it is really very hard for them to finance the fragmentation in the internal market today, and this is something that must be resolved.</p>

Other considerations include having the right education, making connections and creating and also accommodating innovation. A lot of attention is being paid to SMEs, but is that attention well placed? I say this as I have noticed many tendencies towards research once again, but little towards innovation and the SMEs sector.</p>
      <p sl="nl">More attention needs to be paid to the whole financial cycle and also to all kinds of stimulus measures, which are not always within the gift of you or the Commission. Very often, for instance, what is needed are small sums, business angels and venture capital, for the SMEs sector. How would you regulate that with this fund? Will the fund that you have been talking about cover all these issues for small sums, too? It is often start-ups that need small sums.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the SME sector is the central pillar of the Irish and the European economy. In Ireland, approximately one quarter of a million SMEs employ over 800 000, contributing massively to tax income and social insurances. The sector provides sustainable and long-term employment in many towns and villages throughout my constituency in the north-west of Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">The cost and availability of credit remains the single biggest obstacle facing this sector, this despite the taxpayer support received by the Irish banking sector. As a result, many viable businesses are struggling to maintain employment levels through the recession. In addition, reference has been made to red tape and bureaucracy. It continues to hinder the creation of jobs and must be addressed at European level. I would remind the House, and remind the Commissioner, that President Barroso gave a commitment in his State of the Union address here last year that red tape would be reduced and it would save billions.

I very much applaud the approach of reducing and simplifying the bureaucratic burden on small businesses. I know from owners of small businesses that this approach is viewed very positively.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the other hand, we must not forget the other regulatory standards adopted by the European Parliament. These have a very heavy impact on SMEs. The regulations for restaurants, excessive mandatory product labelling and so on not only increase costs, but also undermine the competitiveness of small businesses. It is an enormous burden for them just to keep up with the changes to European legislation. The obligations relating to employees are also a major problem. The effort to maximise protection of employees often increases the unwillingness to employ workers in compliance with all the rules based on the legislation. When adopting regulating standards, we should therefore always think very carefully about the impact on small businesses.</p>

Access to credit is often quoted as one of the main problems facing SMEs, and we have talked about it extensively today.</p>
      <p sl="it">With the entry into force of the Basel III rules, however, it may become even more difficult and expensive. Although Basel III was drawn up with the right intentions, it calls for higher capital requirements for the banks, and that necessarily means a squeeze on granting credit and higher financing costs, which is liable to hit SMEs the hardest.</p>
      <p sl="it">Seeing that loans to SMEs are low risk, would it not be possible to adopt specific measures to resolve this problem? In addition, and most importantly, they need to innovate to remain competitive, but is it possible to innovate without the resources to do so?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, only 10% of SMEs export to other Member States and still fewer to countries outside Europe. Many SMEs are micro businesses with few employees. Offices to advise SMEs in China, help with collecting debts from other Member States, and greater access to venture capital all have rather limited appeal to micro businesses and small businesses with a limited scope of activity. SMEs, especially the small ones, when asked what they want from the government or from the EU, do not say this advice, that grant or guarantee, or the other training; they simply want freedom from excessive regulation and oppressive taxation.</p>
      <p sl="en">From 1998 to 2010, the cost of EU regulation to the United Kingdom alone was 124 000 million. Over-regulation has made medium-sized enterprises less able to compete with other, less regulated countries in other continents. The Act contains fine phrases and bold ambitions.

      <p sl="it">Of all the information that I have been able to read, one item is, I think, particularly interesting: small and medium-sized enterprises that are based and operate in Member States that are at the forefront of innovation are recovering much more quickly than those based in countries regarded as modest innovators.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Given the importance of the activities performed by SMEs in support of the European economy and employment, and the fact that 67% of jobs throughout the EU are created by SMEs, we must ensure that their development is encouraged, access to funding is made easier and that their activities on the single market are not hampered by one-off red tape measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that we have invested too much in bailing out the European banking system at a time when productive, sustainable jobs are being generated by small and medium-sized economic operators.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we could hear a small businessman or woman speak in this Chamber today, we would hear a story that is even more worrying than the details we have been given, especially because of the four structural problems facing this sector, which is a crucial sector and an integral part of Europe’s identity. The four problems are help for internationalisation, reducing red tape – we have heard about the hurdles that have to be overcome just to pay VAT in the various countries – innovation and access to the Structural Funds, which some Member States are not using as they should, and access to credit.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, it is unacceptable that Europe should recapitalise the banks without imposing strict conditions to make them facilitate access to credit for such a crucial sector of the European economy as small and medium-sized enterprises, which are now not being rewarded but held to ransom, if not crippled, by the credit institutions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, findings from recent studies confirm that, despite the extensive activities and interventions of European institutions, business conditions have not yet improved for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Most Member States evaluate the quality of the legislative environment for the activities of SMEs only on a formal basis, and pay scant regard to the implementation of European law in this area. In view of the critical economic situation in Europe, we should be more consistent in putting pressure on Member States to eliminate the excessive bureaucratic burden. In my country, a small tradesman such as a baker or restaurant operator must regularly submit detailed reports to as many as six state institutions. Every business change requires the completion of new approval and permit procedures, and the involvement of at least three or more government bodies. What is the situation in those countries whose economic growth we now envy? Small tradesmen in those countries do business, pay taxes and that is all. We must also try to simplify the mechanisms for small businesses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, three years ago, the EU once again announced that it was going to pay closer attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. However, immediately after the initiative got under way, the economic crisis hit SMEs particularly hard, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s ever tighter regulations, in particular, are strangling the financial air out of poorly capitalised small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU study into high growth potential for small and medium-sized enterprises in markets outside the EU and the adapted strategy promised for the end of the month are sure to make little to no difference when it comes to the fundamental issues. The sovereign debt crisis is paralysing economic growth, while there is not really much trace of the promised cuts in red tape. If 99% of European businesses – which, by the way, are also the largest employers – are only able to tap 10 to 15% of European funding, it is high time that the EU’s system of subsidising conglomerates and multinationals were changed by repatriating the supporting body, and that we came swiftly and unbureaucratically to the aid of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, I think that the Slovak finance minister, Mr Mikloš, hit the nail on the head when he said that people who invest in our economy and create jobs, and who also bear the risk of doing so, should not have their money taken away from them. We should be trying to support those who create jobs and take on risks as much as possible and in such a way that they have the right liquidity. In other words, they simply need products and services that customers buy. If they can sell at a profit, that provides creditworthiness in their businesses, and that, in turn, enables them to obtain credit.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the real challenge in this crisis – for Europe to become more competitive again. We need to see that our companies become internationally more competitive, and to do that we need a new training and qualification strategy in our businesses. Even if you only look at what energy efficiency renovation can give architects, craftspeople and new workers in Europe, you can see that it is the right strategy to pursue this and to examine whether the current taxation model in the Member States is the right one. Not for nothing is Bulgaria ahead of the pack with its 10% income tax rate, while Greece has the highest rate at 40%, and ultimately has entrepreneurs refusing to pay. In this situation, we need to become familiar with the Laffer curve, which, quite simply, expresses the optimal level of taxation.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, crisis, crisis, crisis. Everyone is talking about the crisis. However, we should rather start thinking not about the causes of the crisis, about the banking sector and government debt, but about the way out of the crisis. There will be a way out of the crisis when there are new jobs. These new jobs will create economic growth. However, ladies and gentlemen, these new jobs will not appear either in the banking sector or in large enterprises. The new jobs will appear in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which already employ over 90 million individuals all over Europe. Therefore, it is precisely to the SME sector that we must pay greater attention if we are to overcome the crisis. Why? First, because small enterprises are able to adapt quickly and learn from their own mistakes. Second, they are able to react quickly to market changes. Third, and this is very important in my opinion, they will be the first to create new jobs and to employ young people. So, what must we do to help this sector? Three things: 1) keep our borders open and unrestricted; 2) provide financing opportunities via guarantees and risk capital; and 3) reduce the administrative burden that hampers their growth. Let us help small and medium-sized enterprises. They will help us out of the crisis. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, it is fitting that we are talking about this important matter tonight, which may be as important as the major talks taking place at present in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Mr President, the statistics are compelling: 22.5 million unemployed in Europe, yet there are 23 million SMEs and, if each of them created one job, we would have a surfeit of employment. If you asked SMEs individually whether they could create one job, I think many of them would tell you that in the right circumstances, they certainly could.</p>
      <p sl="ga">One of those circumstances is access to credit, which has been pointed out. I know that in my country, while the banks have been capitalised, they have become terrible in terms of assisting SMEs, even for minimal overdrafts. This is not acceptable and it certainly needs to be looked at. The Commissioner also quite rightly pointed out in the last debate the need for simpler regulations regarding SMEs in terms of public procurement, etc. He also mentioned the importance of venture capital. We are not up to speed with venture capital, particularly compared to the USA, and certainly it is an opportunity to pollinate the economy to create innovative employment.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Finally, regarding e-commerce, there are different statistics going about, but certainly here is a wonderful opportunity, as well, to help grow the economy, SMEs and employment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, small and medium-sized enterprises – this has been said many times already – benefit, above all, from rules that apply to everyone in the same way. That being the case, it is unfortunate that we still do not have the single market governance in Europe that we perhaps will have after the adoption of the Single Market Act, following the adoption of 50 further measures. This is needed because small and medium-sized enterprises have interests that are so general that, unfortunately, they are not represented individually. There are many examples of this, such as access to third countries and to funding and even European standardisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have therefore tried, with the Consumer Rights Directive, to provide small and medium-sized enterprises that are active online and that are looking to work in new markets with rules, through complete harmonisation, that deliver the whole single market from anywhere in Europe. We need more such examples, as small and medium-sized enterprises do not have specific interests but simply have the interest of dealing with uniform rules. We should work harder to bring that about.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There is still a huge disproportion with regard to the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular countries. Unfortunately, the poor situation facing many small and medium-sized enterprises in those countries that were in a difficult situation in 2008-2009 has only deteriorated. The data available show that the situation with regard to late payment has improved only for a small number of them. The proposal made by Commissioner Tajani that he will ask the Member States to implement the provisions of this directive as soon as possible is a very good initiative and I join in with this appeal. I think that businesses, more than when we had the opportunity to debate the amendments to the directive, need to receive the payments due to them on time.</p>

The aim of the Small Business Act, adopted in June 2008, is to enhance the spirit of enterprise within independent companies in order to boost competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support the development of education in this area by applying the best practices in Europe. In my country, the START programme is intending to develop business skills among young people. The EU must encourage SMEs by facilitating their access to funding. On this point, I want to welcome the granting of European funds for advertising. The new government programmes aimed at stimulating the activities of Romanian SMEs have created or saved more than 300 000 jobs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We all know that, in practical terms, EPCs would mean that SMEs can carry out their professional activities no matter which region of the European Union they are located in, as well as in their own country. If they opt to become an EPC, entrepreneurs will save time and money in legal aid, management and administration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that, at the present time, governments must come to an agreement on a new legislative act to enable small enterprises to register as European Private Companies, precisely in order to be able to ensure the development of such companies with European support. I think that this option, in addition to adopting the European sales contract, would mark a real leap forward for SMEs in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am grateful to you all for your questions and for the points that you have raised. I have listened to them very carefully and will, of course, communicate them to my colleague, Mr Tajani. I am going to try to respond briefly to each and every one of you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, as Ms Sartori said, a large number of the problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises do, after all, stem from the national administrative, bureaucratic and fiscal context or environment. Therefore, we must take action alongside the Member States, and first and foremost at that level, while also taking action at European level. I would also say to Ms Sartori that the text on very small businesses, which you know well, is now at second reading in the Council and should come here, before your Parliament, in February.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Paška raised the issue of the Member States’ powers, and just now Ms Swinburne talked about micro businesses, for which we must simplify matters. Many of you, including Mr Bendtsen, Mr Provera, Mr Brons, Mr Rinaldi and Ms Gáll-Pelcz, raised the issue of financing, which took up a large part of my introduction earlier. I wish to confirm what I said about financing, namely, that we want to make it easier to export and obtain credit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When I implement the Basel or G20 rules for every single one of Europe’s 8 300 banks, of which nearly 4 000 are cooperatives – many are small regional banks that are partners of businesses – I am, of course, very mindful of the impact of these recapitalisation measures on the economic base. This is also true of the internationalisation of SMEs, on which Mr Tajani, acting on behalf of the Commission, will be presenting a communication on 9 November.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say to Mr Watson and Mr Rübig that we are also paying close attention to taxation. My colleague, Mr Šemeta, will be addressing this issue of the complexity, or rather – I shall put it in positive terms – of the simplification of the VAT framework, in particular with regard to everything to do with cross-border constraints, in a Green Paper that he will present at the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Merkies talked about a second chance for honest entrepreneurs and about the issue of non-fraudulent bankruptcies. I just want to say to her that, while only 4% or 6% of bankruptcies are fraudulent, there is obviously a fairly strong link between company bankruptcies and fraud in the eyes of the public.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2010, a Commission project established that the length of discharge procedures was one of the main obstacles preventing entrepreneurs from being given a second chance. The 2011 review of the Small Business Act calls on the Member States to impose a maximum three-year limit on the discharge of honest entrepreneurs who have gone bankrupt, so that they can be freed of all their debts and can start trading again. The Commission will be monitoring the progress made in this area. That is the response I wished to give to Ms Merkies on this important point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also say to Mr Kelly that I am going to propose a measure, within the scope of the Single Market Act, to promote the mobility of venture capital. This does not change the fact, Mr Kelly, that there are fewer funds available for venture capital, as I was able to see again the other day when I was in Munich meeting some small business people who need this credit, but with this passport, we are going to try to promote the mobility of venture capital funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Toia and Ms Handzlik mentioned the Late Payment Directive and its proper application. I can confirm that my colleague, Mr Tajani, has appealed to all the Member States to implement it before the deadline.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would say to Mr Luhan that, in every single area – I could go back over them in detail, but we are short of time – I and my colleagues, particularly Mr Tajani and Mr Šemeta, are looking at ways of introducing specific legislation for SMEs. Earlier we cited the example of public procurement, to which SMEs must have better access.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Nicholson talked about bureaucracy. If we looked carefully, we would find that bureaucracy exists outside Brussels, too. Bureaucracy certainly does exist in Brussels; we can simplify the rules, and we are scrupulously attempting to do so, with one piece of legislation at a time, but I also think that an effort must be made to cut red tape at national level. I can confirm to Mr Nicholson and Mr Gallagher that we are carrying out this SME test. The European Commission does so for every piece of legislation that it drafts. As I said earlier, we are going to verify that this SME test is actually being implemented in every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Bütikofer mentioned the problems relating to the dialogue and the good cooperation that he wishes to see between the Directorate-General for Research and the Directorate-General for Enterprise. We are, of course, working to establish this good cooperation within the Commission. This is the case with the work being done by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn together with Mr Tajani, traces of which you will find in the new financial perspective. There will be two new frameworks, Mr Bütikofer: one on competitiveness and SMEs, and another to help SMEs to access research funding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the issue raised by Mr Morganti on standardisation, Mr Tajani’s proposal is being discussed. I can confirm that SMEs, through the organisations and the institutions that are participating in this work on standardisation, are not discriminated against. They have a say in the matter. They can make their opinion heard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Kariņš asked earlier where growth will come from. I believe, when we see how important SMEs are – they make up 99% of the economic base – that growth will come, first and foremost, from SMEs that are much more adaptable, much more mobile and much better able to withstand crises. Mr Kariņš called for the opening of borders. Borders do need to be open, but we must not be naive, ladies and gentlemen! That is why we are going to introduce this tool for providing reciprocal access to public procurement markets in the major regions of the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Obermayr called for the renationalisation of European policies. I disagree with you, Mr Obermayr. If you go down that road, you are going to weaken, fragment the single market again, and we know full well that we need a large European market to restore growth. Believe me, when you are in China or the United States, the only reason we are respected by those quarters, by those major countries, new and old, is because of our internal market made up of these 22 million businesses and these 500 million consumers. I urge you, let us not go down the road of renationalisation or national withdrawal. I am well aware that this ideology exists, but I do not believe it is the right one for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Băsescu spoke just now about training credit. This is a subject on which we need to have European policies, since many Member States do not have sufficient credit for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I was talking about growth, I will take the opportunity to say that Mr Tajani and I are working on an issue that is not straightforward, since, not so long ago, industrial policy was still a dirty word. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we should become bold again like we were at the start of the European project, with the Coal and Steel Community, and like a number of manufacturers have been with Airbus, by bringing in industrial sectoral policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are a few strategic areas – new information technologies, public health-related biotechnology, new energy sources, materials, transport – in which we simply have to ensure Europe’s independence, our ability to stand alone and not to depend solely on technologies or products manufactured by others. As Commissioner for the Internal Market, I do not accept that Europe is simply a land of services. We are well aware that we need services, but we must remain a land of production and not settle for consuming or buying products manufactured in the territory of, and by, others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I believe that the time will come when we have to call together for new industrial policy initiatives – that is my personal opinion, but I am working on this with Mr Tajani. Mr Schwab is very familiar with this work that we have done together, particularly with Mr Grech’s report and the numerous pieces of work that have been carried out. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, since you are all interested in the fate and the future of SMEs, to take a good look at this scoreboard, which is the scoreboard of the Single Market Act. I have worked on it with around 10 of my colleagues, the main one being Mr Tajani, but not just him. We have identified 12 tools for growth and made around 50 proposals, including 12 key ones. Some concern, I repeat, innovation and research, and, more specifically, the European patent, which we and the Polish Presidency hope to obtain in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, all of these proposals that we are going to make, if possible, over the next two years – and as early as this year and the beginning of the next for many of them – are helpful, proactive proposals and regulations that are designed to ensure that the single market, which is too often perceived as an area of constraints, becomes an area of opportunities for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those who know me know that I am against theoretical or ideological legislation. SMEs need their lives to be made easier; they need investment, innovation, mobility and taxation to be made easier. That is precisely the aim of the work that my colleagues and I are doing to bring SMEs closer to the single market, as I said on the day of my appointment as Commissioner. SMEs feel that this single market is made for large operators and big players. I want that to change, as does Mr Tajani. That is the answer I wanted to give to Mr Schwab, but also to Mr Martin and Ms del Castillo Vera, who raised these issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also point out that we have launched a web portal specifically for SMEs so as to help them find information on everything that we are doing. We will return to these issues with Mr Tajani and put them all together so as to actually show what we are doing in all EU legislation, as a sort of SME-Europe contract. Our work is about bringing SMEs and the single market closer together, and that is also the way in which we must go about restoring growth. I am convinced that growth will come, first and foremost, from SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="ga">It was in this room last year that I told Parliament that many small family businesses had contacted me in relation to problems with accessing funding and credit. The situation has worsened since then, and many of those businesses have had to close or let people go. According to the latest report from the European Central Bank in relation to SMEs’ access to funding, there has been no change or reduction in the number of SMEs reporting that they have difficulties in accessing capital.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We in the EU are constantly talking about the importance of SMEs for the economic recovery and competitiveness of the EU, but little has been done to deal with the big obstacle facing SMEs: access to capital.

      <p sl="ro">One third of SMEs in Romania posted poorer results in 2010 than in the previous year, while representatives of two thirds of SMEs in Romania regard the general economic climate as hostile. One of the main causes of the decline in this sector is the drop in domestic demand due to the fall in consumption by the population. The Romanian Government’s austerity policy is tantamount to stopping the engine of a car on a slope to save petrol. However, we are facing the risk of the brakes turning out to be faulty and of disaster being closer than the fanatics imposing excessive taxation and appalling reductions in sources of income for the population may realise. Inflation, delays in the payment of invoices by the state, and the high cost of credit are another few obstacles hindering SMEs’ development. This is the reality we face in many EU Member States even though SMEs have been placed at the heart of the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs since 2005. Against this background, a joint programme is required to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit at a time when private initiative can come to the rescue of investors who have gone bankrupt and of workers who have lost their jobs due to the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for 99% of all European businesses and provide jobs for more than 90 million people. These are the figures we need to use as a basis for a constructive debate, particularly in view of the recent economic crisis, which has resulted in the loss of some 3.25 million jobs in SMEs. It is also true that our enterprises have deeply rooted structural weaknesses. These include poor international exports, difficulties accessing credit and endemic European bureaucracy. To give just one example, it costs only EUR 694 to open a business in the US, whereas the average cost in Europe is EUR 2 285, and it takes two to three months to obtain a licence. We need to make this simpler. European businesses have to deal with excessive bureaucracy and administration costs every day, and this does not help them in their daily struggle to compete with China and the other emerging economies. This is why I hope that Europe can be made more competitive, through the creation of more favourable conditions for doing business that will boost the growth of SMEs, helping them overcome the issues that hinder their development, and through the promotion of an innovative and entrepreneurial mindset among young people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Europe has been slow in responding to the current financial crisis. The focus has been put on fighting the fire instead of investing in the future. May I remind the Member States that the drivers of economic growth and creators of new jobs are, and continue to be, SMEs. It is really alarming to see from the 2011 Small Business Act review that at national level, it is mostly the same limited number of Member States that are engaging seriously in implementing the SBA. An urgent task for the Member States is to review the SME financing schemes and administrative burdens, making their application and reporting procedures less bureaucratic. The EU’s good example in establishing the ‘only once’ principle, which would prevent public authorities and administrative bodies from requesting the same information on different occasions, should be applied unconditionally to ensure SMEs see a radical reduction of administrative bureaucracy. Also, improved and more efficient loan guarantee schemes should be made available for SMEs with no further delay. For the ‘SME test’ to be effectively implemented in every Member State, the EU should develop clear guidelines to ensure the quality and regularity of the test in question.</p>

Currently, there are approximately 23 million SMEs in the European Union, which employ around 67% of the total number of private sector workers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Small Business Act (SBA) constitutes the framework of the EU’s policy aimed at strengthening SMEs, thus allowing them to grow and create jobs. During the period 2008-2010, the Commission and the EU’s Member States implemented the measures set out in the SBA in order to reduce administrative burdens and to provide SMEs with easier access to finance and to new markets. In the words of Commissioner Tajani: ‘SMEs represent more than 99% of all businesses and employ more than 90 million people in Europe. They are the driving force of our economy and must be kept strong, competitive and innovative. The Member States must act quickly to ensure that the Small Business Act is fully implemented’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Even though most of the initiatives contained in the SBA have already commenced, the review of its implementation to date concludes that more intensive efforts are needed to assist SMEs and that the European Commission should be more focused on the pursuit of measures which provide support to SMEs in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Three years ago, the EU once again announced that it was going to pay closer attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. Once again, however, there was no consistent planning. Immediately after the initiative got under way, the economic crisis hit SMEs particularly hard. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s ever tighter regulations, in particular, are strangling the financial air out of poorly capitalised small and medium-sized enterprises. The EU study into high growth potential for SMEs in markets outside the EU and the adapted strategy promised for the end of the month are sure to make little to no difference when it comes to the fundamental issues. Not only are these enterprises being choked by the paralysis of economic growth as a result of the sovereign debt crisis; there is also no trace of the promised cuts in red tape. If 99% of European businesses, which, furthermore, are also the largest employers – and that is precisely what the SMEs are – are only able to tap 10 to 15% of European funding, it is high time that the EU’s system of subsidising conglomerates and multinationals were changed by repatriating the supporting body. The promised cuts in red tape and a re-think in connection with the Basel reforms also need to be evident before the SME sector runs out of financial air.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Hungarian consumers are witnessing an increasingly sad state of affairs. What they see and experience is very depressing. What they see is that their local shop, where they have been buying their bread and daily necessities, closes overnight. And the same goes for the local butcher and clothes shop.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is a general phenomenon in Hungary and Eastern Europe that small and medium-sized enterprises go out of business in quick succession. On the other hand, multinational companies, receiving excessive financing from taxpayers’ money, are thriving. On weekends, they almost turn into sacral halls, siphoning customers from family businesses.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is why I think that the EU should turn its focus urgently on small and medium-sized enterprises, while they still exist, rather than allow multinational companies to benefit from tax incentives. The EU should provide prioritised funding to family businesses, which, according to Jobbik , are the token of our recovery from the crisis. The prioritised funding of family businesses would have a positive impact not only on the economy, but also on society.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the documents on EU enlargement published recently by the European Commission informed aspiring members that progress on the path to European integration is possible only and exclusively on the basis of genuine results. The published conclusions therefore pleased those who have continued making progress in implementing the necessary reforms and fulfilling the criteria, often on the basis of compromise between political players. For those who have not managed to do this, and who continue with unproductive muscle-flexing instead of constructive, rational dialogue, the year since the publication of the last reports has been lost time. It is also a warning that nobody else will do the necessary work for them. If they want to retain the support of their own citizens, they will have to behave accordingly and get down to work. No one is going to believe their excuses about objective difficulties and unhelpful foreigners.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, youth unemployment in some Member States is reaching 30% or 40%, and in some areas, almost half of all young people are unemployed. This is a massive problem. What must or can we do at European Union and national level to change this situation? I believe that, above all, when drawing up and implementing national programmes for increasing employment, we must pay particular attention to youth problems and provide for instruments that would promote access to employment for young people, without reducing their employment and social guarantees. We must improve labour market research and forecasting to determine professions which lack employees now and which will lack employees in the future, and give young people as much information about this as possible as they prepare for their studies. We must involve young people more actively in education and worker retraining programmes, encourage entrepreneurship among young people with various measures, from the teaching of business basics in secondary schools to the application of tax incentives for setting up companies, and provide young people with more information on European Union programmes in this area. The procedures for carrying out work placements should be regulated in more detail.</p>

In these happy days, let us remember that the Basque people never accepted killings in our name. We held the first demonstration against ETA terrorism on 28 October 1978. The majority opinion of the Basque people has always been: no to ETA.</p>

This would make it easier to strengthen peace, improve coexistence, work towards reconciliation and rely on our memories to make sure that mistakes are not repeated, and to put right the consequences of these mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="es">Peace starts by making amends for the victims’ suffering, recognising their civic courage, their rejection of revenge. We owe them justice, solidarity and respect.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in recent weeks, the Portuguese people have lost 14% of their pensions, while in recent years, they have lost 30% of their pensions and one fifth of their salaries to innumerable tax hikes. However, what you did not know is that this country in difficulty is making direct overseas investment, which has rocketed by 134% over the last year, 80% of which goes to a single country – the Netherlands – which is an EU country, where 19 out of the 20 largest Portuguese companies have created fictitious headquarters so as to escape taxation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What this means, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, is that there are countries that are losing out from the crisis and countries that are gaining from the crisis. This situation is bad for both, since it prevents us from seeing the evidence – and this could perhaps destroy us – that common budgetary targets without fiscal harmonisation sets Europeans against one another and could destroy the euro. In 1919, a European called John Maynard Keynes said that if debate were along the lines of prudent generosity instead of imbecile greed, the financial prospects for Europe would be much better. Tragically, the decades that followed showed that he was right and we know that no one gained from them.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the release last week of the Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, by Hamas, in exchange for the release of over 1 000 Palestinian detainees, has rightly given rise to feelings of joy and optimism on both sides and elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, if this optimism is to translate into a force for good, specific action is needed, mainly on the part of the stronger party, Israel, which is in a position to take specific steps in that direction. It could gradually reverse the isolation of Gaza, gradually release all Palestinian detainees and freeze the settlements, while Hamas, for its part, could stop launching rockets at Israel.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is the only way the aforementioned exchange of detainees will help to start negotiations, in the hope that they will lead to a solution. Otherwise, Shalit’s release, in exchange for the release of a large number of Palestinian detainees, might encourage the abduction of more Israeli soldiers, with a view to exchanging them for Palestinians still being held in gaols, which none of us wants.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, many Member States have introduced Large Family Cards, both at national level as well as at local authority level. Their main objective is to provide assistance and support to large families. Each of these cards entitles families, to varying degrees, to benefit from discounts granted to them by the issuing entity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, we are still short of European Union legislation which would provide large families with identical entitlements throughout the Union. In my opinion, both the European Parliament and the European Commission should actively support large families by creating at least general principles for the introduction of a European Large Family Card. Therefore, recognising the need to acknowledge the value of large families in increasingly ageing European societies, as well as the potential for the European Large Family Card to become an effective instrument in the implementation of pro-family policy across the entire Union, I would like to make a strong call for the Commission to take prompt action in this matter.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Europe is home to 25% of all the world’s forests. Europe has primary forests which are natural treasures of unparalleled diversity and must be protected. Unfortunately, many forests in Europe are victims of excessive clearing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In Romania, in the Retezat National Park, one of the last intact forests on Earth, deforestation has taken place on a huge scale, with the authorities’ consent, even within the protected zone. In practical terms, cutting down trees causes the forested areas to fragment, soil quality to deteriorate and species of flora and fauna to disappear.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, the European Union has a deficient system for monitoring its forests, which does not feature comprehensive, regular, mandatory evaluations of forestation, deforestation and reforestation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why this area must be improved. At the same time, I think that the practices for protecting and administering the forested areas in the European Union need to be improved so as to be able to leave these valuable assets to future generations.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, we mark 55 years since the Hungarian nation rose against its Russian oppressors. Throughout these years, the 1956 revolution has been the symbol of heroism and the indestructible desire for freedom. The heroes of the revolution did not only shed their blood for their country, but also for other nations. This is why 23 October is not only a celebration for Hungary, but also for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On the anniversary of this inspiring day, we must take stock of whether the EU is doing everything it can in support of the current freedom movements. The Iron Curtain has already fallen, but millions are fighting in our neighbourhoods for their right of self-determination, among them, Belarus and the Arab Spring movements.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We cannot allow our internal problems to prevent the EU from supporting the democratic movements. The crisis cannot lead to indifference. Therefore, the upcoming long-term budget must allocate appropriate resources for a neighbourhood policy that is based on the principles of democracy.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the purpose of the decisions adopted by the summit on the capitalist crisis and the controlled bankruptcy of Greece and the haircut which the PASOK government is haggling over with its allies in the European Union is not to bring respite to the working and grassroots classes; it is to apportion the losses that certain banks and other sections of capital will suffer temporarily.</p>
      <p sl="el">For the working people, they mark a harsh new attack on their lives. Developments corroborate the fact that, as the capitalist crisis and the impasses created by the bourgeois administration deepen, the European Union is becoming more reactionary and more aggressive towards the people: action is being taken to step up the anti-grassroots policy and the EU 2020 strategy to convert the workers in all its Member States into very cheap labour for the benefit of capital.</p>
      <p sl="el">In these hard times, an important factor in these developments is the progress being made in the fight by the working and grassroots movement, such as the impressive forty-eight hour strike in Greece on 19 and 20 October which, despite efforts to suppress it and organised provocation, is resisting and fighting capitalist barbarity and seeking to overturn the power of the monopolies and break free of the European Union, so that power can be returned to the people and the debt can be written off unilaterally.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As you have probably learnt, there was a very high turnout and perfect organisation, and I would like to highlight, above all, the value of these elections in Tunisia as a model. At a regional level, Tunisia provides a benchmark, and it was here that the Arab Spring started. Indeed, I firmly believe that the benchmark provided by the elections here will actually become a model.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The ballot box has spoken. All that remains is for the parties to form a government. On the other hand, the constituent assembly obviously has to produce a text which supports the rule of law. It will not be an easy task, as indicated by the current situation.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to highlight the discretionary, crony-like and undemocratic style of government adopted by the right-wing administration still in power in Romania.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One of the most recent glaring examples of this is the blatantly arbitrary allocation of public money to town councils headed by representatives of the government’s party.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the course of allocating funds to town councils with debts, more than half of the money was targeted at the elected representatives from the Liberal Democratic Party. I believe that we have a duty to draw attention to these cases which reflect an increasingly hostile and unfair environment where opposition representatives are also harassed, boycotted by the media and blackmailed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to appeal to Europe’s institutions to respond to these abuses which are threatening the fairness of the pre-electoral process and of the elections due to be held next year in Romania.</p>

Traian Băsescu is the same person who, along with his government, is protecting the rich in Romania and making the poor foot the bill for the crisis. By this I am referring to pensioners, teachers and doctors, and those on very low incomes in general.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For us to exit the crisis, if we want to find real solutions enabling the European Union to make further progress and be a successful project, we need to discourage completely the hypocrisy, lies and doublespeak.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, ‘definitive ceasefire’: two simple words that we have spent so long waiting for. There have been too many murders, too many kidnappings, too many people injured, bombs, threats, insults and town halls burnt down, and too often we have had to bear all this alone, misunderstood, scarred, discriminated against, ignored and sometimes forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, we withstood it, because we knew that we were going to win. We knew that one day, we would bring ETA to an end, that terrorism would never achieve anything. They alone have been responsible for these 50 years of terrorism, which have prevented the Basque Country from living in peace and freedom, so we owe nothing either to ETA or to those who supported them. However, we owe a great deal to all those who, in the face of tragedy, stayed in the Basque Country and spoke out for freedom.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have experienced a rollercoaster of emotions over recent days. The tranquillity of knowing we will not receive any more threats is mixed with the pride of knowing that we did the right thing and, above all, our memories of the victims.

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we are living through times that will decide Europe’s fate. Moreover, although the situation has changed rapidly before our eyes from a problem concerning Greece and Portugal to a wider problem at European level, the truth is that the inadequate solutions suggested, and the delays associated with them, have not done anything to prevent the rapid deterioration of the situation. The search for solutions oriented towards the Member States rather than genuine European solutions has enabled the markets to continue speculating on sovereign debt, and has dictated totally unrealistic timescales and a totally unrealistic pace, which some Member States are trying to achieve by applying brutal measures previously unheard of to people, businesses and the public sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is absolutely no room for delay in finding an immediate common solution to Europe’s sovereign debt risk that wards of market and speculative pressure, and that buys time for any necessary adjustments.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the free movement of workers is a very sensitive problem indeed. Ultimately, it is going to shape the economic and social future of the European Union. As rapporteur, I have to stress that we face a situation that is politically untenable and economically irrational. The free movement of workers cannot be accidental. It is a right that all the Member States have agreed upon. Yet we are witnessing a situation in which Member States are deciding to introduce or to re-introduce restrictions and are even suggesting that they could introduce more later on.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is pure politics: national and electoral politics. The economics tell a very different story. For years, official figures – some of them from the Commission – proved that east European migrant workers did not generate unemployment and did not put under stress the welfare systems in their countries of destination. On the contrary, this European influx brought economic growth, which is generally accepted and evaluated at around 1% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">The idea of more Europe has been fashionable lately. Should we mean by this more Europe for fewer Europeans? Because we do have a single market for capital and goods, but we do not have a single market for labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">What does this mean? This means that western companies can operate in the east, sometimes successfully, sometimes generating thousands of unemployed, while east European workers cannot seek a job in the west. And this is not all. The same countries that restrict east European workers, Romanians and Bulgarians in this case, are happy to hunt for the best of the best in eastern Europe: medical doctors, engineers, IT specialists.</p>
      <p sl="en">This should be stopped. It is economically, politically and morally wrong. People will seek jobs as it is their right to do so. We have granted them this right. That is what my report supports. That is what the committee supported in its vote, and this is what I hope this House will support tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="bg">There is one conclusion which I came to from this hearing. There is no clear evidence to show that we should still keep the labour markets closed to Bulgarian and Romanian citizens. I wish to call on Member State governments which are still applying such restrictions to review their positions before the end of 2011 when the second transitional period of the restrictions expires.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Now is the time to show your real attitude to European integration, to a genuinely functioning, open single European market. I want to address, in particular, Commissioner Andor and the European Commission and ask you to be really strict and impartial when examining the evidence which Member States must present if they want to continue these restrictions.

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ungureanu, for this important report which reflects the basic idea that we must promote workers’ mobility, one of the fundamental values of the European Union, but we must do this responsibly. In other words, we must promote full mobility for workers, not just any mobility. When encouraging people to move, we must offer them a guarantee that their rights as workers will not be violated and that they will not be exploited in a foreign country. It is precisely for these reasons that there must be close cooperation between law enforcement and labour inspection bodies in different states. We must ensure that people leaving to work in other countries are not forced to waste the education, qualifications and work experience they have acquired and take lower qualified jobs. To do this, it is necessary to further strengthen the recognition of professional qualifications throughout the European Union. It is also necessary to evaluate the situation in countries where the scale of migration is very significant for economic and social reasons, with many educated skilled workers leaving such countries. Such mass emigration might cost these countries very dear in the future, both in an economic and a social sense. I would therefore once again like to call on the European Commission, the Commissioner here present, and the Member States, to find solutions to resolve this problem now.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report. I will start by saying that this report is essentially an agreeable one, and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is able to fully support it, because it is correct that the right to live and work in another country of the Union is one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms, and that is something that we must protect and develop. However, we in the Group of the Greens would like to introduce the concept of ‘mobility under decent conditions’, because it is the case in our Member States – I know this from my own country of Denmark – that there are major problems with social dumping and pressure on wages and working conditions. We see discrimination against workers from other EU Member States in relation to Danish workers, and that is unacceptable. I do not believe that, as a society, we can accept a division of our labour markets and pressure on wages and working conditions. We therefore need to focus more on combating discrimination and social dumping. The Member States must do more to enforce national rules. We need increased control, more information, more investigative work and a consistent effort on the part of the EU to ensure that mobility also continues to take place under decent working conditions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality contributed an opinion to this report for which I was the rapporteur. The free movement of workers is unquestionably one of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the EU, contributing to greater economic and social cohesion. Considerable progress has already been achieved in this area, but there are still legal and administrative obstacles to mobility in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Commission report on the application of the directive of 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move freely within the territories of the Member States showed that transposition of the directive is less satisfactory in relation to family members. It is therefore necessary for individuals to be properly informed about their rights and options, including the rights of their families. In relation to the free movement of persons, I would mainly like to emphasise here that family members and partners – and ‘partners’ is an important word – should be given the same rights and provided with adequate services, such as child care facilities, nurseries, schools, health services and so on. I am therefore pleased that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has incorporated the opinion of my own Committee regarding family members into its report.</p>

That is why, in this context, talk about encouraging workers’ mobility often means encouraging social dumping and exacerbating the exploitation of those who need to work in a country other than their own, even where these are countries of the European Union. We are therefore calling for a policy of social development and progress, and for an end to the austerity policies that are exacerbating unemployment, poverty and exploitation, and that are leaving workers with no means of defending their livelihoods and families.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Traian Ungureanu, for his report on promoting worker mobility within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission shares this House’s opinion of the positive impact of geographical mobility on Europe’s economies. Over the last 40-plus years, geographical mobility and the fundamental principle of freedom of movement for workers have contributed to European integration and the building of the Single Market. In addition, geographical mobility contributes to both employment and economic growth. This is particularly relevant at a time when high levels of unemployment coexist with labour shortages across sectors and regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Citizens must be encouraged and better informed if they are to undertake a cross-border career move with confidence. It calls, inter alia, for better knowledge of the job market situation. People need to know where the jobs are.</p>
      <p sl="en">Anticipating and matching labour market and skills needs are a top priority for the EU. That priority has been followed up by practical action and the development of new tools like the Job Vacancy Monitor, for example. These tools will also be helpful for the EURES network of European employment services.</p>
      <p sl="en">EURES provides high-quality information, advice and recruitment services for workers and employers. It is a powerful resource available to the EU for promoting geographical mobility. EURES will be reformed next year to step up its matching and placement capacity and to develop mobility and employment in Europe, as the Commission announced in its communication ‘An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs’. The Commission will support targeted mobility schemes at EU level through EURES. One such scheme is Your First EURES Job. A preparatory version is currently under trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the EU’s very extensive legislation in the area of free movement of workers, more effective channels of communication between mobile workers and state services are needed to give workers full access to information on their rights and obligations. To that end, I can inform you that, in response to your report, the Commission is assessing the advisability of adding an enforcement dimension to existing EU rules on equal treatment of mobile workers and what the best options for that would be.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also given fresh impetus to Member State enforcement of the directive on freedom of movement for citizens (Directive 2004/38/EC) in response to concerns voiced on the topic. This rigorous policy of enforcement has produced substantial results: the majority of the Member States have amended their legislation – or announced their intention of amending it according to a clear calendar – to ensure full transposition of the Free Movement Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also committed to continuous monitoring of the Accession Treaties’ provisions with respect to the Member States which have opted temporarily to restrict free movement of workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to a request from Bulgaria and Romania on 20 June under the 2005 Act of Accession, before the end of this year, the Commission will present a new report on the way in which the transitional arrangements on the free movement of workers from those countries have functioned. The report will analyse the post-enlargement migration flows, the main characteristics of the intra-EU mobile persons, and the economic and labour market impact. While any decisions to maintain restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers in the third phase, from 1 January 2012, lie with the Member States, they will have to be notified to the Commission by the end of the year and be justified by serious labour market disturbances.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes this own-initiative report and agrees with the House that reaffirming a fundamental Treaty principle and promoting geographical mobility is vital. Mobility is among the best ways of reducing skill mismatches and boosting our economies, particularly in the current context of high unemployment and very uneven economic growth. It therefore represents a key element of the Europe 2020 strategy to which all Member States have signed up.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The right of every European citizen to choose freely where to live and work within the European Union is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Unfortunately, this is exercised fairly rarely for reasons to do with linguistic, social and cultural differences, as well as with administrative and legal obstacles. The European Commission report published in 2008 makes it clear that mobile workers from the countries which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 have had a positive impact on Member States’ economies and have not created major difficulties for their labour markets.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, at present, at the end of 2011, Bulgarian and Romanian citizens continue to face restrictions imposed on them by some EU Member States. I am expecting as soon as possible all Member States to allow Bulgarians and Romanians access to their labour markets. I think that restricting the mobility of workers is detrimental to Europe’s competitiveness. This encourages the informal economy, undeclared work and false self-employment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We cannot have a single internal market without the free movement of labour. Romania and Bulgaria are still facing restrictions on the European labour market. These restrictions have a legal basis and all new Member States have had restrictions. At the end of 2011, we will see how many Member States are going to express their desire to extend the restrictions on access to their labour market for Romanians and Bulgarians. I believe that the reasons for extending the restrictions in the various Member States are unfounded and promote protection of their own labour market in a populist manner, which is economically unjustified. However, Member States can complement each other as they have certain professional gaps in certain sectors. At the same time, there is an illegal jobs market in the EU maintained by certain Member States. If domestic legislation was applied much more strictly and rigorously, the need for restrictions on the labour market would disappear. Last but not least, on the subject of the various directives, such as the Blue Card or Seasonal Workers Directive, which regulate the European labour market for third-country workers, I think that a key condition for those Member States wishing to bring in workers from third countries is to get rid of the restrictions on workers from inside the EU first.</p>

This is why coordinated action is required between institutions at national and European level to remove all the current barriers preventing workers’ mobility. Bearing in mind the crucial role which SMEs play in the European economy and their contribution to boosting economic growth, employment and social cohesion, we must take specific actions promoting the development of SMEs so that they can absorb the workforce, particularly from the younger generations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The rise in the number of young unemployed is alarming. According to Eurostat, the number of unemployed across the European Union under the age of 25 is 5 139 000.

      <p sl="hu">The mobility of employees within the European Union has been treated as a potential problem for a long time. Although the concept of free movement of employees is present in the Treaties, Member States are allowed to introduce temporary restrictions on this. The reason is almost always the same: the large influx of immigrants from poorer to more prosperous states and the threat that the citizens of the recipient state may lose their jobs. These fears, however, are unfounded. Employee mobility has a beneficial effect on the whole of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In spite of this, only a small amount of employees use their right to free movement. We need urgent harmonisation of national and EU regulations. Current EU strategies must be adjusted to the impacts of employee mobility and the increasingly important role of SMEs. It is paramount to involve SMEs in the process, because their growth ensures the creation of new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Information and knowledge are also a matter of priority. The current level of information provision is inadequate in many Member States. Employee mobility must receive better support and information must be easily accessible for everyone involved. Enhanced efforts are also required in the area of training programmes.

Unfortunately, there are still many problems with mobility, and it is our job to eliminate these for our citizens, so that this privilege may also benefit them in practice. In the first place, it is important to have cooperation between all of the relevant authorities and bodies of the individual Member States, coordination of their activities, and improved control mechanisms and inspection services. Mobile workers are always encountering significant discrimination and abuse of their rights. We must therefore ensure that they have access to sufficient information on their rights and obligations, and the possibilities relating to working and living abroad, and that they have proper legal and social protection. We must try to create legislation that will guarantee them equal rights to those of home country nationals, including the right to equal pay, the right to strike, to engage in business under equal conditions, to have their families with them and for their families to have access to education, health care and so on. I also value highly and encourage the creation of programmes in support of mobility, such as Erasmus, for example, and various twinning programmes. Mobility within an EU framework is highly motivating for our citizens in these times of crisis, and it is now up to us alone to create and ensure the best possible conditions for them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, it is my honour today to present to you the report on the mutual evaluation process of the Services Directive. As the Commissioner is aware, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is acutely interested in the current progress and in the results of the implementation of the Services Directive, which I personally consider to be one of the more important pieces of legislation of recent years. We have, therefore, paid very close attention to the mutual evaluation process and its results, as well as to proposals for further initiatives aimed at improving the functioning of the Single Market for services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report on the mutual evaluation process focuses, in particular, on three issues: firstly, on experiences relating to the mutual evaluation process of the Services Directive; secondly, on its results and further initiatives which need to be undertaken in order to strengthen the Single Market for services; and thirdly, it focuses on the role that the mutual evaluation process can play as a tool which can be used in future policy instruments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection considers the mutual evaluation report as a valuable form of cooperation. It has enabled the administrations of the Member States to learn about the implementation of the Services Directive in other countries and the solutions that these countries have employed. Furthermore, the mutual evaluation process constitutes a large body of knowledge which provides us with a more comprehensive, although still not exhaustive, picture of the situation in the Single Market following the implementation of the Services Directive. It is therefore my opinion that the mutual evaluation process should be applied to other policy areas. However, due to the time and effort required, its use should be selective, compliant with key regulations, and always based on the examination of individual cases. In our opinion, the transparency of the entire process should also be increased, by providing regular updates to the parties involved as to the course of the discussions, for example.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the report, we refer to and are supportive of the further actions which the European Commission has proposed on the basis of the mutual evaluation process. Commissioner, in our work on the report, we were always mindful that the key priority for the creation of a Single Market for services is the full and complete implementation of the Services Directive in all Member States. Unfortunately, today, nearly two years after the directive was first implemented, we have not yet reached that stage. The European Parliament wishes to be informed regularly about the progress of work on implementation. Moreover, we believe that the Commission should take steps with respect to Member States to ensure implementation of the Services Directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are looking forward with particular interest to the economic assessment of the implementation of the Services Directive and its impact on the functioning of the market for services. We are keen to find out whether the savings resulting from implementation of the Services Directive, as expected by businesses, are being achieved; we want to identify areas requiring change as well as areas where expectations have been overestimated. At a time when the most heated debates relate to national budgets and the necessity to reduce spending, we cannot afford to squander the opportunities that the directive provides, especially since nine out of 10 new jobs created in the EU economy are in the services sector.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, more attention should be paid to actions aimed at improving the functioning of the internal market for services, focusing, in particular, on the areas which can bring the greatest level of added value. We also have to take a closer look at the freedom to provide services clause. Commissioner, through this report, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection would like to express its commitment to the process of implementing and monitoring the directive. I would like to re-emphasise that at the present stage, the most important objective is to ensure that the provisions of the Services Directive are implemented and applied properly and that the Points of Single Contact are fully operational.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the full implementation of the Services Directive plays a key role in maintaining the EU’s competitiveness globally. At the same time, a truly integrated single services market will help stimulate economic growth. I should point out that services account for more than two thirds of GDP and jobs across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The EU must encourage Member States to identify and eliminate legislative loopholes which could present unjustified obstacles preventing the smooth operation of the services market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In Romania, for example, performance tests are going to be carried out in the tourism, business and construction sectors. At the same time, the aim of the electronic Points of Single Contact is to facilitate access to information on entry to the services market in Romania.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, as the rapporteur also mentioned, nine out of 10 jobs in the European Union are carried out in the services sector. This area is clearly the driving force of the European Union’s economy, generating roughly two thirds of the EU’s GDP.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We need a single services market which performs really efficiently and operates as a key instrument for generating economic growth and jobs and for improving the EU’s global competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, there still remains a great deal to do to ensure the smooth operation of the single services market. I think that, in this regard, an increased role needs to be played by national, regional and local administrations in Member States. Dialogue with them also needs to be stepped up, as is the case with the regions and local public authorities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The mutual evaluation process is a valuable instrument for identifying the remaining obstacles. This is a shared responsibility, and the success of the actions being proposed will be achieved by engaging all the relevant institutions and parties in this process.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, according to the Commission report, nine out of 10 jobs are created in the services sector. A functional single market in services is vitally important if the EU wants to be competitive in the global arena. The EU and its Member States are currently in the depths of a major crisis, with unemployment constantly rising and job growth uncertain. It is therefore necessary for all instruments of the single market to be fully implemented in all Member States and, at the same time, for all elements to be functioning, such as the Points of Single Contact, for example. The mutual evaluation process is an instrument based on a thorough evaluation of the regulatory framework for services. Only a mutual evaluation process of this kind will be capable of ensuring that the single market in the EU functions as it should.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the creation of a single market in services has been one of the cornerstones of the European project since its inception. The single market in services was not planned as an end in itself. It is an instrument for improving the everyday life and prosperity of European businesses and EU Member State citizens. The enormous potential it offers must be used as a lever for creating sustainable growth and jobs, for extending the possibilities of consumer choice, and for providing businesses with new opportunities. This applies even more in the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The mutual evaluation process has shown, for example, that the Member State in which a service is provided often imposes insurance obligations on cross-border service providers. This is regardless of the fact that a given provider may already be adequately insured in the place of establishment of the activity. This causes considerable problems with cross-border service provision in sectors such as services for businesses or for the construction industry. I would therefore like to ask the Commission to consider whether the sort of barriers that still exist today cannot be eliminated for the future and for the greater prosperity of European companies, and so that Member State citizens can enjoy more efficient service provision.</p>

      <p sl="es">The reciprocal evaluation process enshrined in the directive has shown itself to be a useful instrument. Firstly, it is useful for clarifying certain ambiguous situations that still exist, secondly, for evaluating whether the measures have been adopted by the Member States and applied according to the spirit of the directive, and thirdly, for facilitating and propagating the use of good practices.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it is clear that numerous national barriers still exist, which, more than anything else, block the growth of professional services between companies, and that it is necessary to ensure that the provisions of the directive are applied fully and properly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we regret the continued insistence on liberalisation of services at European Union level that takes no account of the widening gap between the Member States’ economies. In general, freedom of establishment means that the large companies and financial institutions of the most developed countries will find it easier to establish themselves in the countries with weaker economies. This contributes to thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises going out of business, as is happening in various sectors in Portugal, in particular, in the areas of commerce and services, in the area of supermarkets, and in other sectors. We therefore challenge the European Commission to rethink its strategy on the liberalisation of services, so as to safeguard jobs and development in the Member States with weaker economies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the report on the mutual evaluation process of the Services Directive provides new evidence of the main role played by the European Parliament on this important issue, a central role both during the negotiation of the directive and the transposition period.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is, for me, an essential contribution to the full implementation and the good quality of the Services Directive in all Member States. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Małgorzata Handzlik, for the relevance of her analysis and the strong messages delivered by this report. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Ms Evelyne Gebhardt, who did impressive work in her report on the implementation of the Services Directive adopted in February, and, of course, throughout negotiations on the directive, as well as the Chair, Mr Harbour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report highlights the importance of fully implementing and operating all aspects of the Services Directive, whether they are legal or practical aspects. I welcome this. We do not only need an adaptation of the national legislation; we must also ensure that the one-stop shops are fully operational. The report points it out clearly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also introduces a strong signal with respect to the next steps in developing the internal market for services. The Services Directive has already brought a tangible success, but the internal market for services is not complete. There is still untapped potential. That is why we must move forward and your report contributes to this goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome your support for the actions proposed by the Commission in its communication of January 2011 on the results of the mutual evaluation process. The results show that we must take more into account the needs and practical problems of users of the internal market, our citizens and our businesses. Which tools should we use to achieve this goal?</p>
      <p sl="en">Together with the Member States, the Commission has launched a review of the consistency of EU rules on the ground. The Community instruments often operate simultaneously and their implementation may lead to practical difficulties. Thus, an architect based in Belgium who works for clients in the Netherlands may be subject, depending on the situation, to the Services Directive, the directive on professional qualifications, the directive on electronic commerce and many other instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">In cooperation with national administrators, we are currently conducting a performance test or consistency test on these rules. These tests are performed on the basis of case studies in three key sectors: construction, tourism and business services. I am determined to keep Parliament and, notably, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection closely informed of progress in the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the basis of the outcome of the benchmark, the Commission will propose concrete actions in 2012 in order to ensure a better functioning of the internal market. In addition, we will look closely at the specific barriers identified during the peer review. Thus the requirements limiting the choice of legal form or requirements relating to the ownership of capital can be an impediment to the growth of service activities, domestically and cross-border. Such restrictions often apply in sectors with high added value, which are an important source of growth and skilled jobs – lawyers, engineers, tax advisers, architects and so on and so forth. They can prevent the development of innovative business models without even being necessary for the protection of consumers or workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will assess the impact on the ground of these requirements and decide by 2012, if possible, whether specific initiatives should be launched. We will also carry out a study of the economic effects of the implementation of the Services Directive based on the result of the work achieved by the Member States. Your report shows the importance that Parliament attaches to the achievements of such a study. I would like to present the results of the study to you personally early in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, concerning the mutual evaluation of the working method, we know that it is an essential tool in the context of the Services Directive; the scope is very broad and involves profound changes in national legislation. This is, without any doubt, a tool of the future, but I agree with you that a case-by-case analysis is required before applying this methodology to other legislative tools. We must be pragmatic. I count on the continuous support of Parliament to maintain the dynamics created by the implementation of the Services Directive.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The implementation of the Services Directive is a significant step towards a better functioning of the Single Market for services. However, I believe that we still have tasks ahead of us. The key findings of the mutual evaluation demonstrate that the Commission needs to take further steps to enable the European economy to fully benefit from the potential of the Single Market for services.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order to get a realistic and useful overview of the functioning of the internal market for services through the performance check, it will be necessary to take account of EU instruments beyond the Services Directive. It is welcome that the Commission has taken a similar position and the performance check will therefore not be an abstract thing, but will be conducted on the basis of concrete sectors and activities which illustrate how the Single Market works and in what areas problems remain.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In view of the often cross-cutting nature of the barriers in the services sector and the legislative instruments applicable to it, the performance check is also useful to identify issues of a horizontal nature.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It should be emphasised that the performance check should, in all cases, allow the formulation of sector-specific conclusions on the functioning of the Single Market for services and, where necessary, identify the need for other actions, including legislative intervention if required.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Lastly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank her for her comprehensive work and openness. I believe that this work has resulted in an excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on alternative dispute resolution in civil, commercial and family matters (A7-0343/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-208-000" speaker_id="4544" name="Diana Wallis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, in this instance, alternative dispute resolution is said to be about civil and commercial matters, but it concentrates mainly on consumer issues. What we are talking about is delivering access to justice and, by doing so, finding a way of encouraging cross-border transactions, because at the moment – and this has, in fact, been the case for many years now – there are too many fears about enforcement of rights. Traditional justice is complicated, slow and expensive.</p>
      <p sl="en">At a time when we need to encourage cross-border commerce and transactions, we need to find a new culture of civil justice: one that is different, one that is quicker, cheaper and more conciliatory, and one that brings results.</p>
      <p sl="en">For many years now, a loose network of ADR providers has been in existence, coordinated through the Commission: ‘EEJ-Net’ and ‘FIN-Net’. They have been successful in their way, but they are not enough. They do not answer the question that most citizens will have. When they want justice, they know where their local court is. They do not know where their local ADR system is. We need to make sure that the systems that exist are given publicity. We need to make sure that there is an overall system to ensure that every consumer can reach an ADR system to solve a dispute. We need to ensure that the systems that do exist are of good quality, that training is provided to those providing ADR, and that the quality is independently monitored.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, that is the direction we want to go in. However, we do not only want ADR: we also want ODR, online dispute resolution. People are buying online across borders: they should also be able to settle their disputes online. But this should not be limited to activity in one area of consumer disputes. There should be joined-up thinking with regard to other Community instruments such as the proposal for a contract law – now called sales law – and proposals for collective redress. All of these things deserve to have an ADR element.</p>
      <p sl="en">Alternative dispute resolution should be about a new form of cross-border European justice, a change of culture for the 21st century. It should go across the board, but what would be most important at the moment is to deliver that change in relation to consumer and SME cross-border transactions. We should do that and do it as a priority, and I think this Parliament looks forward to seeing the Commission’s proposal before the end of this year.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, alternative dispute resolution has become a technique in social, legal and economic areas. It is indispensable in the administration of justice, in environmental protection, as well as in labour affairs and international economic relations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ms Wallis has prepared her report in the Committee on Legal Affairs in order to develop a safer and more effective EU system. The increasing number of procedures shows that there is a need to harmonise legal frameworks within the EU. A more transparent system, coordinated at a European level, can increase legal security and the protection of consumer rights.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Promoting more intensive communication and cooperation between Member States and competent professional organisations at EU level is more important than making alternative dispute resolution compulsory. We can save considerable energy and costs for society and the economy by providing adequate information for citizens and SMEs on the various options for dispute resolution. In addition to the existing guarantees provided at Member State level, it is the EU’s job to provide the benefits of alternative dispute resolution for the 27 Member States within the single market.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I have long supported alternative dispute resolution, but with one major reservation, which is the inclusion of family cases within the scope of this proposal. On account of national traditions, this area belongs within the competence of Member States. Moreover, complex family disputes, including disputes over the raising of children, should be decided by judges trained and specialised in these matters, and the EU should not interfere in this area.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Of course, I welcome the development of a system of alternative dispute resolution in civil and commercial cases, particularly the resolution of consumer disputes, since this system offers cheaper and faster practical solutions. These systems should be developed on the Internet and fully automated at the first level in order to be attractive to businesses, and they should also fulfil the principle of impartiality, transparency, effectiveness and fairness. I drew attention earlier to the fact that we must make use of experience from the system of handling EU Internet domains, for example.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Diana Wallis for drafting this report in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that providing consumers and SMEs with access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is vital for consolidating the single market. These bodies ensure that disputes are resolved in confidence and quickly, under more favourable financial terms than in the judicial system.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should point out that, although the courts of commercial arbitration are fully operational in Member States, they specialise in resolving national law disputes. The reason for this is the lack of legislative harmonisation at European level. This makes it difficult to resolve a dispute within several legal systems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I therefore support a code of good practice being drawn up for standard contracts. This would facilitate the use of alternative mechanisms, especially for low value international disputes.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a point I very much welcome in Ms Wallis’s report on alternative dispute resolution is the fact that it calls for a general ‘justice for growth’ agenda across sectors which goes beyond consumer-producer disputes to include civil transactions, and family disputes in particular.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would argue that family mediation and a strong commitment from Europe in this respect are extremely important issues, in view of the growing number of disputes that generally follow separations and divorces in the European Union. In particular, disputes between spouses who are often of different nationalities tend to drag on longer and consequently have a terrible effect on the children.</p>
      <p sl="it">Experience in many countries shows that having a family mediator, as someone neutral that they can freely turn to, helps partners reach a mutually acceptable understanding, with an agreement in writing that can be submitted to a judge to be made official. This goal must therefore be determinedly pursued at a European level, although with due respect for subsidiarity, not least in light of the 2005 EU regulation on parental responsibility. It will also strengthen cross-border protection, particularly with regard to child abduction and the role of the European Parliament Mediator.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope, therefore, that the Commission also includes this aspect directed to the Member States in its legislative proposal.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, access to justice is a fundamental right. The aim both of judicial processes and of alternative means of dispute resolution is to strive for the restoration of legal peace or the resolution of disputes between parties. Alternative dispute resolution helps consumers and businesses to resolve conflicts through a third party by an out-of-court route, and thus becomes an effective alternative to the judicial process, particularly in terms of cost.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is a pity that the knowledge and awareness of Member State citizens is relatively sparse regarding the existence of alternative systems for dispute resolution. Only a small percentage of citizens know how to submit an actual complaint to an alternative dispute resolution body. In my opinion, we must educate and inform the public about the possibility of resolving disputes through alternative mechanisms to judicial proceedings. These also offer the possibility of avoiding a directly confrontational approach and, at the same time, provide the possibility of dispute resolution that is advantageous to both parties.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must, however, strive for a balanced approach, taking account, on the one hand, of the scope of powers of the alternative dispute resolution systems and, on the other, fair procedures and proceedings in relation to the parties involved.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I support the idea of seeking agreement. I think it would be a good idea if, in the interests of greater legal certainty, procedures for the alternative resolution of commercial and property-related disputes were unified. Consumers and businesses both surely applaud the effort of the Commission and Parliament to constantly improve the mechanism for seeking agreement via an out-of-court route. It has advantages for both sides.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like draw attention, however, to the fact that the family, which is mentioned in the title of the report, does not fall within the remit of the Union and its institutions. I share Ms Roithová’s opinion that this is a highly sensitive issue, demanding respect for the different national traditions and social conditions. A single standard will not suffice here. We should not forget the problems created by the effort to handle international divorces at European level, and we should bear in mind that there is no one to represent the child in the process of mediating a dispute between two parents.</p>

    <intervention id="1-215-000" speaker_id="96654" name="Jaroslav Paška" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sk">Madam President, alternative dispute resolution in civil, commercial and family matters may, in many cases, be a more peaceful, less costly and quicker form of dispute resolution. It is therefore important for the European public to be well informed as to the relevant legislation, as well as the possibilities arising from it. In particular, the regulations governing European proceedings in low value cases, and the directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters, provide a common European basis for cross-border and national alternative dispute resolution.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I agree with the view that high levels of awareness among the public and businesses regarding the advantages of alternative dispute resolution will help towards a substantial expansion in the use of these methods, relieving the courts of the burden of resolving consumer and family disputes in particular.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Recourse to out-of-court possibilities for resolving family disputes, making it possible to reduce the psychological burden on the parties in dispute, as well as on the children, is certainly a better solution than lengthy disputes involving evidence and witnesses. It is therefore sensible to support the application of reliable alternative dispute resolution at all levels.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission welcomes the support on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) for consumers and businesses and we also welcome your suggestions concerning the Commission’s legislative proposal on ADR for consumer disputes. The Kraków Declaration, which the Single Market Forum adopted earlier this month, repeated this call.</p>
      <p sl="en">ADR is also one of the 12 proposals in the Single Market Act. My colleague, Commissioner Dalli, will be putting forward two legislative proposals which are scheduled for adoption by the Commission on 23 November: one for a framework directive on ADR for business-to-consumer (B2C) disputes; and one for a regulation on online dispute resolution. The directive will ensure that consumers and traders can access ADR schemes for any dispute between them, and the regulation will establish an EU platform for disputes related to cross-border online transactions between consumers and traders.</p>
      <p sl="en">These proposals will be the first bricks for the construction of an effective out-of-court redress system. The Commission is also aware, as your report states, that we have to deal with business-to-business (B2B) dispute resolution, particularly for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the Commission consultation on B2C disputes, stakeholders were very clear: they expressed a preference for a different type of instrument to apply to B2B disputes, catering for them more specifically. Therefore, the Commission is, at present, examining different types of ADR, including arbitration work, in particular, in the cross-border context of B2B disputes. We are at a very early stage of information gathering and we will examine all possible problems which could hinder businesses, in particular, SMEs. However, we would welcome all proposals on this while we are working on it. If the outcome of the work is positive, as I believe it will be, I will ultimately come forward with a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Mediation Directive, it is a viable option of ‘first resort’, particularly – as has been mentioned – in family law cases where the parties cannot settle their conflict themselves and going to court may unnecessarily escalate their dispute. Mediation may lead to fast and cheap results.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Mediation Directive has applied everywhere, except in Denmark, since 21 May 2011. This directive can be applied to civil and commercial matters, including family matters and disputes between businesses and consumers. The only exclusion is where parties are not free to decide on their rights and obligations under the applicable law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes Parliament’s support for the key provisions in the Mediation Directive, which should also apply to other ADR schemes. Independence, impartiality, confidentiality, the effects on prescription and the enforceability of agreements are to be regarded as common standards for all kinds of ADR.</p>
      <p sl="en">Specifically concerning the Mediation Directive, following the opening of pre-infringement proceedings in July 2011 against nine Member States which were late in transposing the directive, today, 20 Member States have notified the Commission of national measures for implementing it. I am continuing to follow carefully the situation in the other Member States.</p>

But, behind that, lies the fact that we have a number of emerging economies that have contributed to changing the global economy and have defeated poverty in large areas of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are still a number of countries in poverty who need more growth and more opportunities. We can see the fact that currency policies in some major economies are contributing to the imbalances. We can see that the lack of competitiveness in a number of other countries is also adding to this. We need to achieve a balance at global level, and that requires global governance and proper institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I think we need to be aware of the fact that in countries and regions with a lack of competitiveness, we need new policies and reforms. But, at the same time, we need to ensure that we have a flow of trade with these emerging economies which are currently protecting themselves with artificial currency policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report has very broad support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I would like to forward my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who have made broad compromises possible. We underline the need to tackle structural misalignments and thereby the prime causes of the current imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to ensure that we have responsible monetary policies at global level, and we need to achieve currency policies that are convertible and open up more trade possibilities between the countries with surpluses and those with deficits.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it is also important to look at the institutional set-up. The more we want global governance, the more need there is for accountability, transparency and legitimate institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We think it goes without saying that the G20 is one of the most important structures. But it is also important that we achieve more global participation, better implementation of decisions and a higher level of transparency. Here, we also underline the importance of the IMF and the WTO because, within a better structure, decisions and discussions in the G20 can also achieve legitimacy and transparency by being implemented in the IMF.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the report, we underline the need for the European Union to be able to speak with a strong voice, and we underline the need for the European Union to contribute to strong global governance and strong global leadership and to make sure that we are adapting international global institutions to the realities of today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, congratulations to our colleague, Mr Hökmark, for his good report and comments. I just want to say two things.</p>
      <p sl="en">One, the transaction tax, has been mentioned, particularly by President Barroso, as something desirable that we should implement within Europe and some say perhaps within the eurozone. I think it is obviously sensible in terms of logic. Firstly, because it is only right the financial sector should contribute, particularly when it has got EUR 4.6 trillion from taxpayers generally. But I think it has to apply globally because otherwise it could lead to distortion, particularly of foreign direct investment within various parts of the European Union. I think that is a very important point.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point is that I agree completely with Mr Hökmark that the European Union needs to speak with one voice and it does deserve a seat at the WTO, and also that the IMF needs to be more transparent and its managing director should be elected.</p>

      <p sl="ro">This crisis has highlighted the need to consolidate economic governance globally, especially in the financial sector. The lack of a common framework could result in macro-economic imbalances and squandering opportunities to get out of recession.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The current system must be improved by introducing new levels of regulation and control bodies. Unfortunately, the International Monetary Fund or informal G20 meetings are bodies with limited powers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The EU must find an integrated solution for resolving the debt crisis in the euro area. A fragmented approach has not produced any results so far. My country has already adopted austerity measures in order to maintain financial stability. Romania currently has a cash deficit below 5% of GDP, with the 2012 target being a deficit below 3% of GDP.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, The issue of economic governance has gained increased importance recently. However, in order to discuss the global aspect of economic governance and to achieve results at the upcoming G20 summit, it is important to understand its European aspects and its dangers.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Although the European Council has discussed and will discuss very urgent matters, unfortunately, it seems that this is done very slowly. Months have passed and the Greek problem is yet to be resolved. This can pose further dangers for the euro and also the EU itself. We did adopt the ‘six-pack’, but this is not enough for progress.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In light of the above, it is to be welcomed that the report goes further and calls for global cooperation as regards monetary supervision, and even speaks about a more successful macro-economic policy. We must also see, however, that as long as Europe is unable to resolve the situation of its common economic policy, restore the stability of the euro and regain the trust of investors, it cannot expect any results from the upcoming World Economic summit.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Mr Hökmark has produced a very good report indeed, and it has to be said that we really have a lot to communicate in the area of global economic governance ahead of the November meeting of the G20 countries. There are two things I would briefly like to mention. First, it is already clear to most of the players that the former global economic order is collapsing and is highly unlikely to continue in its present form. I see this in part as good news, because the levels of global economic inequality and social injustice were beginning to be unsustainable. It is not at all clear, however, that the new system rising from the ashes of today's system will automatically be better.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the event of an incorrect interpretation of what is currently happening, and incorrect responses to these developments, it is even possible and likely that the situation could deteriorate further. I would therefore like to call on European and national leaders to be aware of the seriousness of the situation and to act accordingly. We have reached a point where time is of the essence and the fates of entire countries and millions of their citizens hang in the balance.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, at a time when European and global economies are facing an uncertain and difficult future, this is a very timely report. At the heart of two summits, the EU summit on the future of the euro area and the G20 summit, the proposals of the Hökmark report are intelligent and well-balanced, and they deserve the attention of global leaders attending these summits. What should we expect from these changes? For the economy to improve, we need consistency and cooperation between countries. We need tighter financial regulations, as well as trade agreements. Both the G20 and the IMF are important institutions that deserve a change that would make their governance structures more effective. There is a need for reform within the IMF, so that the BRIC economy gets the say it deserves in today’s world. The G20, which, at the moment, serves as a useful talkshop, needs a binding legal base. The recommendations on global financial operators are important; now is the time to make the separation between traditional and investment banking. Global economies, especially in the West, are going through a rough period. There is a general lack of self-confidence. It is crucial for these global institutions to adapt to today’s needs.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the fundamental issue that both the report and this debate have avoided is knowing what, in the end, are the causes of the so-called global imbalances; the real causes of the global economic and financial crisis. Moreover, it is no coincidence that they are avoiding this debate: their intention often seems to be to push ahead and strengthen the paths that have brought us here. There is therefore an urgent need to disregard the real causes of the crisis if the same road of iniquity, injustice, and economic and social disaster is to be pursued.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Make no mistake, the crisis we are experiencing is a crisis of capitalism, which forms the basis of a broadly dominant economic system at global level. As such, the solution to this crisis will not come from the international institutions, whose purpose is to ensure the conditions for expansion of capitalist relations of production, riding roughshod over the sovereignty of the peoples and over democracy itself, so as to force capitalist accumulation by repressing or crushing rights and the aspects of civilisation we have achieved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation, the free movement of capital, and trade liberalisation and deregulation are actors and settings in a film that we have already seen, and whose plot and ending we, tragically, know all too well. The solution to the imbalances, which I would call global injustices, is to break with this path; and to break with these institutions whose records have already shown that they are neither good people, nor recommendable company.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I agree with Mr Hökmark when he says that we need to discuss changes to the global economic system at the G20. The G20 is a forum at which discussions take place on the future and on appropriate changes to coordination in the area of finance, economic policy, banking and so on.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am not sure whether the EU is, at this point in time, a player capable of offering alternatives or ways out, as the EU itself has serious problems which it is currently unable to handle sufficiently well. We need only recall the current economic crisis and the start of the problems with Greece, which remain unresolved, and if our economists and political leaders are unable to tackle the problems we currently face in Europe operationally and constructively, it will be hard for leaders from other successful parts of the world to take their advice. I am therefore afraid that our involvement in this area will not be valued.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to underline that the European leaders are going to make strong proposals this week in order to get Europe out of the crisis. Having said that, Mr Hökmark is right to underline the importance of global economic governance, which is a very important contribution to all the governance problems on the different continents. As a Commission, we share many of Mr Hökmark’s recommendations. I would also like to thank the Members of Parliament who have taken part in the discussion and made contributions to this topic.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current crisis was a real watershed in global economic governance. Before 2008, nobody could have imagined the large advances made in bringing economies together or the G7 coordinating a policy response to a recession or an economic slowdown. This is no longer the case. The G20 has taken its place and has become a prime forum for international economic cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, more is needed to counter the current slowdown and this will be discussed in Cannes shortly. More is also needed to strengthen global governance and, as stressed in the report, the EU should play a leading role in this economic governance reform. We can only do that if we also lead by example and that is what our Heads of State and Government are going to do this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Barroso said in his speech on the State of the Union in this House that it is also time to have unified external representations of the euro area with the strengthening of the internal governance. I am thinking here of the ‘six-pack’. We now need to move towards a more unified external representation of the euro area in international financial institutions like the IMF, and the Commission will soon make proposals in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The debate on global economic governance came late, as proven by the very outbreak of the economic crisis in 2007. Since the beginning of the 2000s, economic and financial regulations have been unable to keep pace with the development of the financial sector. Regulatory authorities have been trying to keep global financial processes under control from within national frameworks, while the banking supervisory system left it to the speculators whether or not to follow the rules.</p>
      <p sl="hu">International economic governance organisations such as the IMF and the World Bank are suffering from a severe lack of legitimacy. Their organisational structure does not reflect the realities of the global economy and the increased role of emerging economies, especially the BRIC countries. The G20 have yet to transform into an organisation that can adopt truly substantial, legally binding decisions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union recently took important steps towards a more forward-looking management of financial processes. The financial transaction tax would make financial transactions more transparent and controllable and would, at the same time, ensure, without resorting to excessive anti-banking steps that could prove an impediment to growth, that the financial sector plays a greater role in mitigating the impacts of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the G20 summit in November, the European Union must aim to convince the major actors of the global economy about the necessity of stronger and more effective solutions, of damage prevention instead of damage control, in order to trigger economic growth and ensure job creation and a more equitable distribution of the burdens of the crisis. The aforementioned solutions can be considered a solid basis for creating a system of global economic governance.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Barbara Matera, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the situation of single mothers (2011/2049(INI)) (A7-0317/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-232-000" speaker_id="96813" name="Barbara Matera" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin my speech first of all by thanking the shadow rapporteurs and all my fellow Members who have helped to enrich the report with new ideas, in order to support this vulnerable group of women who, not by choice, find themselves alone having to deal with their children growing up and then the need to pursue their own careers.</p>
      <p sl="it">This category of women is at high risk of poverty and needs support from Europe’s institutions in the form of specific kinds of assistance. I am honoured to have been entrusted with the responsibility of drafting this report on the situation of single mothers in Europe. This is the first own-initiative report by Parliament aimed at identifying measures to support single-parent families.</p>
      <p sl="it">Several months ago, I organised a public hearing in Parliament to invite experts from single-mother support groups and to achieve an initial exchange of views on the priority areas in which we should act and support single mothers. In recent months, I have met with single-mother support groups from various Member States, including Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Belgium. In Brussels, I took the opportunity to pay a personal visit to an association where single mothers live, and during my visit, I was able to exchange information and ideas with the head of the organisation and gain a closer understanding of the difficulties that these women face every day. On my trip to Warsaw with the delegation from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I was able to examine the benefits and measures in support of single mothers in Poland.</p>
      <p sl="it">Single mothers are an overlooked demographic category. Geographically, across Europe, there are different perceptions and policies towards single mothers. In the southern Mediterranean countries, such as Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece, it is generally accepted that the extended family will assist in bringing up single-parent children on a voluntary basis without reimbursement. In the northern and Nordic countries, such as France, Sweden, Germany and Denmark, government welfare systems are in place to help single mothers with benefits and social assistance policies. In the Eastern European Member States, there is a general mix of policies, some holding on to strong familial values from the Communist regimes and others having a mix of the northern and southern European policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">At present, 5% of European women are single mothers. In some Member States, such as Estonia and Latvia, the proportion is as high as 9%. Single mothers are often stigmatised as being irresponsible teenagers, whereas in fact, 85% of them are aged between 25 and 64. In addition, the negative effects of the financial and economic crisis that has been felt across the European Union have hit this group of women especially hard.</p>
      <p sl="it">Already burdened with the gender pay gap, single mothers are hampered by the need to take on debt and care for their children. The state of health of single mothers is statistically more unstable than that of married women. They are under more stress because they single-handedly carry out tasks normally performed by two parents. They often cannot afford adequate medical care and do not have time to rest. Statistically, single mothers throughout Europe are less educated than their married counterparts, and so they also find entering the labour market difficult and beset with obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report is full of new initiatives and, especially, new goals that the European Union should set itself, because this is a subject that needs to be put at the heart of the Union’s list of priorities, particularly since the number of such women is growing across Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating Ms Matera for her thorough analysis of this very painful topic. The situation of single mothers is, in effect, linked to child poverty and this is what this report is all about.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Every third child from single-parent families, where the mother is bringing up children alone, lives below the poverty line or faces the risk of poverty. In this situation, negotiating employment, family life and work is not only about improving the quality of life: it becomes a matter of survival.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If we are unable to take decisive measures in this area, not only will we jeopardise the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy, but we will also leave these children, who are brought up by single mothers, entrapped by poverty.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I think that decisive measures are needed to resolve this problem.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, single mothers have a hard life. They sacrifice themselves for their children and they are at a high risk of poverty. I therefore support efforts to improve the position of women who remain alone with their children following family break-ups. We now know that it costs the state more when mothers raise children alone. We should therefore devote more attention to the causes of family break-up. Many marriage crises come about as a result of the bad economic situation. If we focused more on supporting families, many of these women would never be left alone with their children. The Commission and this Parliament would first have to acknowledge, however, that a woman is not just a unit of labour, that a family is not just a small group of people living together, and that marriage is not just a formal declaration of love. They would have to understand that it is not by chance that we are talking about single mothers this evening, and not single fathers, for all of the proclaimed equality between women and men.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I would like to voice my support for the report and the work of Ms Matera, as far as the situation of single mothers is concerned. In my opinion, Member States should encourage the right support models for mothers to increase their chances on the labour market, making it possible to combine professional life with child care.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is right to support families with child-raising measures within the framework of taxation systems, but care should be taken that it is not just single mothers that are supported, and that married couples with children are not economically disadvantaged as an institution, thereby encouraging growth in the number of single mothers. Any investment in child-raising is the best possible investment, given the demographic situation in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The European Commission should ensure the sharing of best practices between Member States in this matter, and Member States should also support non-profit organisations that concentrate on working with single mothers and helping them to return to the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her complex, interesting and fertile report. As has been mentioned, single mothers now make up over 5% of the female population in Europe, and I would also point out that 85% of single parents are women. Single-parent families are therefore concentrated on the female side, and this fact should now be increasingly acknowledged by welfare, employment and social security policies.</p>
      <p sl="it">Naturally, as the report shows, this is a highly diverse population in terms of age, legal status and economic situation. In northern Europe, for instance, the vast majority are young unmarried mothers, especially in certain countries in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, while in the south, most single mothers with children are separated, divorced or widowed. Their conditions are therefore also highly varied. Whereas certain welfare services and systems are probably more advanced in northern Europe, not least because family connections are less extensive, in the south, we are having to face a new, emerging problem of young unmarried mothers as well, but with a welfare system that has not yet been properly focused or thought through. There are therefore different speeds of response.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe the first thing that should be done, as the report also points out, is to compare welfare systems and best practices in order to work out the right mix of services for employability, for training and for welfare, in order to guard against forms of poverty and exclusion from the job market and to enable these women to achieve a work-life balance, which is much more complicated for them.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in many societies, particularly those dominated by patriarchal or conservative models, single mothers have a very low status. Many regard single motherhood as a kind of temporary situation that will change once the single mother finds a partner and establishes a so-called traditional family. However, this distorted view complicates their position even further. We must therefore respond to this factor through policy adjustments. It is the responsibility of Member States to try and secure adequate living conditions for single mothers. The lives of these women, who usually suffer from pay differences anyway, are further complicated by a difficult financial situation. We need to adopt adequate public policies, including education policies, policies on the provision of care, health policies, policies in the area of employment and social welfare systems, and housing policies. These should alleviate the living conditions of single parent families, particularly in terms of the reality faced by single mothers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the situation remains desperate for single mothers in Europe. A huge number of single mothers face fundamental problems such as poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, poor health and so on. These mothers have to struggle against discrimination in the workplace, in educational establishments and elsewhere. We must therefore create financial support programmes for them in relation to, for example, their education, the education of their children, return to school, career development, health care, child care and advice, as well as encouraging businesses to employ single mothers, for example, through tax breaks. We must also try to find funding for the existing rescue and assistance centres for abandoned women with children, which are full of volunteers willing to help those in need, but sadly lack sufficient funding. We must also, of course, not forget about awareness raising, the education of young women and prevention. Educating and informing young women about their sexual and reproductive rights and wellbeing, as well as, for example, methods of protection, is surely an effective form of prevention.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to end with one statement: it concerns me that, sadly, not one man has spoken yet in this debate.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I was the shadow rapporteur of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) Group in connection with this report. I would like to say that in the Czech Republic, one child in four lives in a single-parent family, with mothers accounting for 90% of single parents, which is very alarming. I therefore mainly support policies that will enable these women to work and to combine employment with child care. I consider flexible employment opportunities, such as part-time work or working from home, to be vital here. Apart from this, it is also necessary to provide sufficient child care infrastructure to allow single mothers to go to work.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I know from my own experience in local authority politics that it is necessary to secure a decent existence for single mothers and their children through various support policies. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report, as it is, in my opinion, an excellent piece of work, outlining the main problems of single mothers and focusing on the right objectives. However, as a member of the ECR Group, I still question whether the political instruments referred to in the area of health care, education, social security systems and so on should be within the competency of the EU. In my opinion, the Member States will handle many of them better.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, currently, the number of single mothers is increasing steadily in Europe, but so is that of fathers who are bringing up children single-handedly. There is an ever-growing number of ‘latchkey children’ who remain unsupervised during afternoon hours.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is laudable that the European Parliament is speaking about the difficulties single parents have in remaining competitive in the labour market. It is very important to create the right conditions and prepare instruments that will support single mothers and single fathers in the difficulties they face on a day-to-day basis. Europe should create more programmes aimed at single parents which support their active involvement in the labour market. Such programmes should, on the one hand, allow single parents to improve their existing qualifications, acquire new skills and learn more about self-employment, but they should also offer child care during periods of study and allow single parents easier access to education and opportunities to gain new skills, so that they are in a position to maintain their competitiveness in the labour market. Ensuring that the professional ambitions of single parents are fulfilled is very important to the proper development of their children. In my speech, I have deliberately mentioned single fathers, since, in my opinion, the report should also include single fathers, even if their numbers are significantly lower.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to thank Ms Matera for her very useful and timely contribution, because the topic she has chosen is of the utmost importance. We must be aware that the structure of households in Europe is constantly changing, and that single parents (some are fathers, but the vast majority are mothers) now account for a growing percentage of households with children, and their numbers are on the rise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recent OECD analyses indicate remarkable similarities in all the Member States. By 2030, there will be between 22% and 29% more single parents than there are now, so what we are currently seeing is only the beginning of a very large-scale trend. This, of course, calls for action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first action is in our Europe 2020 strategy. We aim to reduce the number of people living at risk of poverty or social exclusion by 20 million. This is exactly the number of children at risk of poverty in the European Union today, and the figure rises to over 30% for children living with single parents. This is why we want to make a recommendation to the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion on combating child poverty in 2012. It will propose principles and indicators in key areas such as support for families and access to essential services including child care, housing and education. Affordable child care is very important for single mothers and single fathers, who have to be able to enter the labour market if they do not want to be trapped by poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to know more about the phenomenon, which is why we are collecting data to identify trends and compare welfare provisions. Such data are already partly available in the OECD family database (which is cofinanced by the European Commission), and the new family support calculator is a tool that allows users to compare the income situation of various types of families. The European Alliance for Families is a very important EU platform for sharing good practice on family policies and fostering cooperation and mutual learning in this field. There is also our European Institute for Gender Equality, which analyses the data and develops methods and tools for gender mainstreaming and also facilitates mutual learning and the exchange of best practice.</p>

      <p sl="lt">At present, the demographic situation in Europe is very complicated, with a continuous decline in the birth rate in almost all Member States, and we must therefore take measures to create the best possible conditions for mothers to bring up children and to have a genuine opportunity to return to the labour market. It is also very important to ensure that women are able to balance work and family life as well as possible. I would like to stress that in the labour market, we must not discriminate against pregnant women or women who have just given birth purely because of their biological role, the fact that they are becoming mothers. We must protect the career prospects of mothers and must not create barriers to them returning to their job. The improvements to the revised directive would improve the protection of mothers’ rights, would help ensure decent working conditions, and would enable them to invest more time in their family life. It really is disappointing that the Council does not yet have a common position on this important directive and negotiations between the Member States are taking so long without any positive movement forward. I therefore very much hope that the Member States, particularly the Presidency, will continue the negotiations as quickly as possible and will make every effort to reach a codecision so that the way is cleared for this directive as soon as possible. In this area, we should not delay the decision on the grounds of a crisis and save money, because the future of the European Union depends on it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, single mothers are often a neglected demographic group, even though 5% of women in the European Union currently belong to this group.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These women have been particularly hard hit during the current economic crisis. To be able to provide the financial support required to bring up their children, they very often have to go without rest or medical care. We cannot be indifferent to our citizens who are experiencing hardship. I would like to stress the need to grant not only additional unemployment benefits for each child, but also priority access to affordable housing. Furthermore, I believe that single mothers should be offered flexible employment opportunities at EU, national and local level to enable them to achieve a work-life balance.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The draft report covers three aspects of the situation of single mothers. The threat of poverty is the most serious aspect, in my opinion. The report includes five-year old data showing that 32% of single parent households are affected by this serious problem. It can be expected, of course, that this number will be higher due to the economic situation. I firmly believe that single mothers do not often get into these difficult situations through their own inaction. I know from experience in the Czech Republic that the main causes of economic difficulties is the failure of the other parent to pay child maintenance and the lack of support for single mothers on the labour market; in other words, reduced opportunities in terms of finding employment, a lack of flexible arrangements or the small number of places that are available in nurseries and the cost of these. The urgent need to support single mothers can also be seen from the fact that poor living conditions transfer to the children, for whom it is difficult to escape from the vicious circle. Their chances of getting a decent education and a job are diminished. I am pleased that the European Parliament is paying serious attention to this topic.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Sonia Alfano, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on organised crime in the European Union (2010/2309(INI)) (A7-0333/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-247-000" speaker_id="97086" name="Sonia Alfano" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the work that has been achieved with the political groups, particularly the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Crocetta for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Mr Albrecht for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Kirkhope for the European Conservatives and Reformists and Mr de Jong for the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Their noteworthy contributions were decisive in arriving at an advanced and ambitious final draft.</p>
      <p sl="it">Organised crime and mafias are one of the main threats to the security and freedoms of the people of Europe. For the first time in European political history, an official document is making explicit reference to mafias and to the need for specific, transnational measures to fight them. It is crucial to focus on organised crime and mafias because, as the Europol reports show, organised criminal groups are cropping up everywhere; they are taking root in the Member States and have heavily infiltrated the economy, finance, politics and all levels of government.</p>
      <p sl="it">With this report, Parliament is proposing a concrete political line of attack, a serious, coordinated intervention and a treatment that is at last a match for the seriousness of the situation. This treatment is based on the intelligence gathering and analyses of those who fight organised crime every day. I take this opportunity to thank the judges, police representatives, researchers and witnesses who have contributed their precious experience to drawing up the definitive solutions proposed here. In a spirit of service and self-denial, they represent their Member States on a daily basis in an unequal fight against criminal organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">What drives criminal organisations is profit. That is why in the report, we have prioritised attacking assets that can be directly or indirectly traced back to organised crime. We are therefore looking forward with extreme interest to the proposal for a directive that the Commission is due to submit in the coming months on a European body of law to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate criminal assets.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am therefore very happy to see Commissioner Reding here, and I would like to put Parliament’s specific political wishes to her. We ask for European rules to allow so-called extended confiscation and effective preventive measures, such as non conviction-based confiscation; we ask for rules to allow the targeting of assets held by front persons; and, above all, we call for rules to use confiscated assets for social purposes, so as to turn it into a cultural operation with the full involvement of civil society, without which merely fighting organised crime would be a wasted effort.</p>
      <p sl="it">To give an idea of the importance of the document to be voted on tomorrow, I will give a list of the measures requested at European level: harmonisation of legislation on organised crime; rules for greater victim protection; extension of the offence of mafia association to all Member States; greater coordination and cooperation between Europol, Eurojust and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and with national authorities; improved judicial cooperation and full implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions; rules on transparency and prevention to stop public funds ending up in the hands of organised criminals; rules to counter financial crime and money laundering; and rules to prevent people convicted of offences connected with organised crime from standing in European elections.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are absolutely sure about one thing, Commissioner: these demands, which we vigorously called for in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and which we are about to adopt here, will not remain mere words. We will use every means at our disposal to put them into practice, in line with the Treaties in force which, fully in accordance with the democratic nature of the European Union, assign to the national parliaments and the European Parliament the fundamental role of guiding and assessing policy in the area of freedom, security and justice so as to protect the interests of the people of Europe. That is why we hope the Commission will immediately acknowledge the political importance and significance of this House’s position.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to dedicate this work – this first step that Parliament is about to take – to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise, must guide us, and it compels us to send out strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we will send to the people of Europe tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Alfano, on having driven forward this important measure, which, as she said just now, clearly shows the consistent contribution made by all the other political groups. At last we have a single framework for tackling the problems of mafias and organised crime as effectively as possible and with ever greater determination.</p>
      <p sl="it">This measure, and especially the proposals that the Commission will certainly want to put forward, will remove the current barriers at the Member States’ borders to attacking the assets of mafia members and especially to enforcing the measures ordered by the Member States’ judicial authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">These measures include imprisonment with hard labour for those guilty of such abnormal crimes, remote court hearings for witnesses and informers, confiscation for social purposes, and judicial cooperation based on trust. The report paves the way for groundbreaking legislation that is increasingly designed to protect honest citizens and honest business people and also to respond to the pride of those who have refused to bow to the mafia and have had to pay for their pride and dignity, in some cases with their lives.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, it is important to protect every citizen of the European Union against organised crime. The most important thing is to protect the most vulnerable. I mean by that children and adolescents. I cannot imagine protecting children without the cooperation of their parents.</p>
      <p sl="sk">More than four years ago, I called for a Europe-wide campaign under the banner ‘Do you know where your child is now?’ I published material warning parents about the threat to their children. The material included witness accounts and the views of children themselves. During that time, I met with three Commissioners, and despite the situation having grown worse regarding the threat to children from organised crime, I have unfortunately received no positive response.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Alfano, on this important report. It has become an essential reference for Parliament’s actions in an area in which it has new, enhanced competence based on the Treaty of Lisbon. It is a fundamental reference because of its subject matter – the fight against organised crime and mafias in the European Union – and because it calls for a special committee, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also appreciate the fact that some of the proposals I made as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have been accepted, for instance, the proposal to promote the role of associations of victims’ families and the establishment of a European forum, as well as the call for a holistic approach to people trafficking, especially child trafficking, and to illegal adoptions, not least in light of the recent European directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like, however, to place a little more emphasis on the extent to which the text succeeds in showing that women and children make up the majority of direct or indirect victims, especially of crimes against the person, and that there must therefore be a specific, targeted commitment to support and protect women victims of crime and violence, including when they are witnesses or have dissociated themselves, especially from mafia and criminal families, and also to value their role when they commit themselves to a culture of legality.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to mention the growing number of women involved in combating crime as judges, lawyers and police officers, and also as teachers trying to change the culture of our young people in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the fight against organised crime is one of the most important areas and priorities in the area of EU justice policy. Cooperation and coordination between Member States must be improved. Legislation must be unified and focused on legal systems that are as effective as possible at combating organised crime. I support Ms Alfano’s call for the Commission to submit a draft framework directive on confiscating the proceeds of crime. That was one of the priorities of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and, as the Group’s Vice-Chair for this area, I must say that I am delighted that this proposal has been adopted.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is also important to establish a mechanism for effectively redistributing the confiscated resources back into society, so that they are used for social objectives, and, in this context, I welcome the call addressed to the Commission to accept and support the urgent need for European legislation on the re-use of the proceeds of crime for the benefit of society, including witness protection.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Vice-President Reding, ladies and gentlemen, we have achieved a sound compromise on this issue. I would therefore like to once again offer my sincere thanks to Ms Alfano for the report on organised crime. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important that we should make progress on this. The Commission has already presented proposals here. It is a good thing that we, the European Parliament, are also saying where things should be heading, from a fundamental point of view. We do not agree with every point. Further debate, of course, will determine the physical form that this will take.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, then, I address my call, above all, to the Council and the Member States, since greater cooperation would be possible, first and foremost, if common standards could finally also be achieved in relation to police and judicial cooperation. I believe, in this connection, that a number of Member States are still putting up too much resistance against the fact that we also need to harmonise our standards if we want to take our cooperation on combating crime forwards, and that is something that, in my opinion, as well as that of Parliament, is extremely important when it comes to organised crime.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, at the end of last year, Dick Marty, the Council of Europe’s rapporteur for legal affairs and human rights, published his report on the murder of civilians and the illegal trade in their organs in Kosovo. Dick Marty states in his report that the current Prime Minister of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci, led an organised criminal group at the end of the 1990s, and that his gang took part in murders, violence and human organ trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In January this year, the EULEX mission of the EU in Kosovo therefore began preliminary investigations into the claims of Swiss senator Dick Marty. I believe we are all aware of the gravity and sensitivity of the accusations that have been made, and of the consequently difficult task of the EULEX mission, which perhaps cannot rely on the help of domestic Kosovan administrative bodies in this investigation. After all, one of the supposedly protected witnesses was recently killed in Germany. Despite this, I believe that the findings of the EULEX mission will be important for the credibility of EU security policy, and not only in the Balkans.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Alfano for this very comprehensive report. The long list of recommendations will undoubtedly be a rich source of inspiration for the Commission’s future work in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">Organised crime covers many areas of illegal activity and is a global phenomenon, as is the fight against it. Not surprisingly, various recommendations address policy areas beyond home affairs. Many of these recommendations will be helpful to the Commission in mainstreaming the fight against organised crime in other policy areas, including in our relations with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the call to Member States to sign and ratify existing international instruments, which are building blocks. The existing instruments should also be duly implemented, both within the EU and by our partner countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission is assessing the transposition of the Framework Decision on the fight against organised crime. We will conduct a study, which should provide a clear picture of the current situation in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU approach vis-à-vis organised crime is a strategic one, based on common objectives. This is set out in the Commission’s Internal Security Strategy Communication of November 2010. There are a number of goals we want to reach. The upcoming first Annual Report on the implementation of the Internal Security Strategy will provide the necessary details.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the key objectives is to combat organised crime, to uproot its driving force and its profit motive. Crime should not pay, so we have to tackle the financial gains. In June, the Commission adopted an anti-corruption package, and future EU anti-corruption reports will encourage more commitment – also at national level – to help eradicate this phenomenon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Confiscation and recovery of the proceeds of crime is an essential component. We are preparing a new legislative proposal in order to replace existing instruments and to enhance Member States’ ability to confiscate assets. Financial information has the potential to become a key investigative tool. The Commission intends to propose a strategy in this field in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europol and Eurojust remain very important hubs for supporting police and judicial cooperation. There have been many success stories recently regarding the trafficking of human beings and child pornography, which have shown their effectiveness. We need to continue to reflect on how to enhance the potential of these agencies in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many other points which the rapporteur has put in her report, and we will come back to these in a very concrete way. Tomorrow, for instance, the Commission will put on the table a communication entitled ‘Towards a stronger European response to drugs’, announcing the overhaul of the EU rules to fight illicit drugs, for instance. So we are advancing very quickly and hope that you will continue to help us to get ahead, not only with reports, but also with very necessary concrete actions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The key to combating organised crime is the use of instruments making it possible to penetrate criminal milieu and infiltrate them, to confiscate the assets of those convicted, and to protect victims effectively. Of particular importance are solutions that affect the financial or economic interests of criminal groups. A very effective measure in this respect has been the introduction of an extended confiscation of property into the legislative framework of some countries. Currently, these provisions have only been introduced in 12 Member States. Therefore, the European Commission should bring about their mandatory implementation across the entire Community.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A characteristic element of such a system is that there is no need to prove beyond doubt the criminal origin of assets, only to provide prima facie evidence of the fact in accordance with standard procedures in force in a particular country. The burden of proof regarding the legality of the sources of property in question lies with the accused party. Such a provision makes it easier to deprive offenders of the financial gains associated with committing crimes. It should be underscored that it is important to introduce a clear distinction between proving beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of offenders and depriving them of criminal gains, where prima facie evidence of the criminal origin of assets should suffice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For the system to be efficient and completely fair, it is necessary to ensure protection of citizens against possible abuses by authorities; for example, giving the courts the right not to issue a confiscation order in situations where it would be unfair. In view of the global nature of organised crime, it is also imperative to strengthen cooperation in this sphere with the EU’s neighbours.</p>

    <intervention id="1-257-000" speaker_id="1941" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Cristian Dan Preda, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the fourth high-level forum on aid effectiveness (2011/2145(INI)) (A7-0313/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-258-000" speaker_id="96838" name="Cristian Dan Preda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the fourth high-level forum on aid effectiveness, which will be held at the end of November in Busan, provides the international community with the opportunity to reaffirm, deepen and reformulate its commitments to ensuring more effective aid and to promoting development. A great deal is obviously expected of this meeting, which it is hoped will give vital impetus to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals ahead of the crucial 2015 deadline.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Several challenges need to be met if the Busan meeting is to be a success. Firstly, there is the implementation challenge. The latest assessments of the follow-up to the implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda on aid effectiveness show that we are on the right track. Putting these commitments into practice has improved the quality of aid by enhancing good practice. However, progress is limited and unevenly spread between donor countries and recipient countries, and reforms are being applied too slowly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At EU level, a recent Commission study showed that the Member States could have saved the EU some EUR 6 billion per year by implementing the principles of the Code of Conduct on the Division of Labour more resolutely. This is clearly a huge opportunity for development that has been lost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second challenge, which is, in fact, linked to the first, is political. Political will is needed in Busan. Strong European leadership and political commitments are needed to ensure that progress is made internationally on the issue of development aid effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, there is the challenge of adaptation, the heart of the Paris Declaration. The five principles of aid effectiveness must not be forgotten, of course; they must act as a basis for the improved agenda that we will have to create. Development cooperation must adapt to the needs of a changing world. The emergence of new donors, the increased involvement of private operators, the variety of development contexts, and the keen interest in South-South cooperation must result in a fundamental change in the way aid effectiveness is viewed today. An effective and genuinely inclusive partnership must therefore be established in Busan, with account taken of the different circumstances in which aid is distributed today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My report defines the areas in which additional efforts are needed with regard to aid effectiveness, be they democratic ownership and alignment with the priorities of recipients, the division of labour and improved coordination among donors, the necessary transparency of aid or the issue of aid fragmentation and predictability. I am also pleased to note that there is a real consensus of opinion with the Commission, which, in its communication of 7 September, proposed a common EU position for the Busan meeting that is essentially based on the same points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU and its Member States have, in the past, played a very important role in the definition of the international aid effectiveness agenda, from the Paris forum to the Accra meeting, to ensure that a number of clear commitments are honoured more quickly. The EU and its Member States today contribute more than half of the official development assistance that is distributed worldwide. Furthermore, the Treaty of Lisbon has put poverty eradication at the heart of European development policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have here a wonderful opportunity to improve our instruments and thus achieve better results with regard to development. In view of our past commitment and of the particular responsibility borne by the European Union and the Member States with regard to development assistance, we have a duty to prove that we are equal to the challenges and to adopt an ambitious position in Busan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ball is now in the court of the Council, which will shortly have to adopt a common EU position for the Fourth Forum. The proposals contained in my report are a good starting point for trying to gain the support of all the States for clear principles that can give direction to our future aid effectiveness efforts. We must respond to the calls for efficiency and democratic ownership coming from recipient countries through a new development partnership that is focused on the actual impact of aid on the achievement of the development objectives. It must take account of the various situations individually and aim to bring the international community together so as to encourage more coordinated and less fragmented action.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, we can be sure that there is some humanity left in us as long as the fight against global poverty continues. Rome, Paris and Accra showed that development aid is not about distributing handouts. It is a joint enterprise between the recipient and the donor. The Paris criteria have become an instrument making it possible for aid to be effective. The aim of the meeting in Busan is to review the progress achieved with the help of these criteria. We have a compass and we also have a map. In Busan, we will use them to get our bearings, to find out where we are, and to move ahead. At the same time, however, it is very important not to lose sight of our common goal. If we want long-term success in the fight against poverty, we must help people to help themselves. We must not forget this.</p>

I personally think that the EU must adopt an ambitious position in order to increase development aid effectiveness. I welcome highlighting the need to increase transparency, accountability and coordination. At the same time, I must emphasise how important the decentralisation processes are in partner countries, as mentioned in paragraph 15.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital for local actors to be involved in order to ensure that aid is effective and sustainable. For example, a Health Matrix Network project which invested in the capacity of the local communities has helped achieve a 50% reduction in the infant mortality rate in Tanzania over a period of nine years.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I should point out the need to apply fully the EU code of conduct on the division of labour in development policy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Preda for this report, which once again shows that development aid contributes to the battle against poverty and inequality and to the promotion and exercising of human rights. The European Union is the largest international donor and this is why our sense of responsibility towards aid effectiveness should continue to be the top priority on the European development agenda.</p>
      <p sl="es">Busan will not only be an opportunity for reaching legally binding agreements, but also for the European Union to take an ambitious stance in favour of an integrating strategy, driven by all interested countries, with the aim of implementing solid monitoring and transparency mechanisms in the fight against tax havens, and to help to promote and set up alternative sources of financing, such as a tax on financial transactions, mobilisation of domestic resources and the reinforcement and promotion of both South-South and triangular cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="es">A key issue for Spain will be the prioritisation of gender equality as an essential part of the aid effectiveness agenda. In this area, we will pursue the creation of a gender indicator, and I ask the European Commission to support this proposal. I also ask for its support for civil society participation in the negotiation, monitoring and evaluation processes concerning the issue of aid effectiveness.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think I need to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Preda, for his excellent report, even if he did not have a very broad audience tonight to discuss these issues. There is definitely convergence between the EU institutions on the issue, but still a lot of work needs to be done. We are well prepared for the Busan conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I welcome the fact that there will be three Members of the European Parliament in the EU delegation, which will definitely make it much stronger.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards challenges, we need one outcome document at the end of the day, because there are a couple of challenges to tackle. One challenge is to reflect on the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda for Action and what we have achieved. As the rapporteur mentioned, as a donor community, we have not actually achieved today what we should have done according to the indicators. So that means that we need to confirm the Paris Declaration in a way that gives us many more assurances that credible development plans will be followed as regards the necessary support for aid effectiveness. As Ms Záborská said, our goal is to help people to help themselves. That is why the aid effectiveness agenda is so crucial, because it gives the decisive push towards the MDGs.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that is the first block. In way it is clear; in theory, everybody agrees. But what we need to look at is how to formulate it in such a way that, in the years to come, we do not fail on these indicators and in the process. That is crucial.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue is related to the new donors. The landscape has changed. Looking at it from my point of view as Development Commissioner, China, India and other actors are coming into development aid, and not disclosing to the aid effectiveness agenda as the traditional donor countries do. So in a way, it is a contradictory situation. We try to help, whilst not knowing exactly what the other partners are doing. A part of the aid effectiveness agenda should be that everybody follows the same process, perhaps not at the same pace, but we are all transparent. If we are not transparent, then the risk is that we do not actually support the countries sufficiently in fighting poverty. I think it is very crucial to find a good way of involving new donors in the aid effectiveness agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third issue that is very crucial is increasing transparency. As there is an economic crisis in the European Union, people are increasingly asking what results have been achieved in development. The best answer is definitely to give full transparency as to how the resources are being used. I definitely could give this House assurances that the money has not been wasted. It has definitely helped millions of people move out of poverty, and more kids to get to school and to survive in very difficult conditions. But still the public at large expects even more transparency as regards the money that is being used for development aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">That also leads us to ask for some commitments. On the EU side, we are looking for two particular deliverables before Busan: transparency – guarantees that basically all EU-funded support for development policies is fully transparent – and the joint programme, which we are about to discuss with member countries at the end of October. We have moved quite a lot with regard to coordination on the spot, but the weakness of coordination is that you know, but you do not change. It means that you need to establish cycles that follow each other, and fit in with the development plan of a particular country.</p>
      <p sl="en">It seems that coordination is not enough, so basically, the answer is joint programming exercises in the EU. We held out with this in the Haiti case and South Sudan; now it is a time to be more ambitious. Only in this way, going in step with respective countries’ development plans, can we really make the necessary synergies and save the EUR 5 to 6 billion that the rapporteur mentioned in his presentation. We know full well that if we use joint programming, we actually get more money for development, at the same time not taxing anybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe Busan will be an extremely interesting conference. It is a bit different from the MDG conference last year, and the Istanbul conference, so it will be rather challenging to get everybody involved, including developing countries and new donors. But it should be a success; it is a main development not only this year, but before the MDG deadline in 2015. It is quite a commitment and I am grateful for this excellent report that gives guarantees that the EU will again be the leader as it was also in Accra.</p>
